 Lead Lay summary The aim of this project was to gather more information about climate variations in the Southern Hemisphere over the las millennium. Such climate reconstructions are important in order to improve our understanding of the climate system and to enhance accuracy of climate change projections. So far, reliable and well replicated climate reconstructions do only exist for the Northern Hemisphere, whereas existing reconstructions from the Southern Hemisphere are based on a very sparse data basis. Within this project, all currently existing paleoclimate data from the Southern Hemisphere were collected and organized in a database. These so-called "proxy" records consist of time series derived from tree-rings, ice cores, corals, lake and marine sediments, speleothems and documentary evidence. Records from more than 300 sites were analized and screened for their potential for climate reconstruction of high temporal resolution (annual to seasonal). We then used subsets of those records to reconstruct temperatures of Australasia as well as the entire Southern Hemisphere. We used a novel reconstruction technique that allows more reliable estimates of reconstruction uncertainties. The reconstructions were compared to existing reconstructions from the Northern Hemisphere and climate model simulations over the last millennium. We find that late 20th century temperatures appear extraordinary in the context of the last millennium, but the warming is not as pronounced as in the Northern Hemisphere. The results allow, for the first time, to perform long-term analyses of climate variability on continental scales within the Southern Hemisphere and reliable inter-hemispheric comparisons.
