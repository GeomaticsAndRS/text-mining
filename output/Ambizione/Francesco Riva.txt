 Lead Lay summary The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) based at CERN, in Geneva, is the largest particle physics experiment in the world. Its main goal is to search for the Higgs boson, a particle predicted by theoretical physicists in the mid sixties, that has eluded discovery for the past 50 years. Preliminary results from the LHC indicate that this particle has already been observed at LHC (its discovery will be confirmed in 2012).    The Higgs boson plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundaments of Nature. In the first place it is believed to be involved in the mechanism responsible to give a mass to (some of) the known particles. Furthermore it is believed that in the very early universe, the Higgs boson could have created the necessary conditions to produce matter (rather than anti-matter) from an initial Big-Bang filled uniquely with energy.        However, the  theoretical model which supports the existence of the Higgs boson (named Standard Model), also predicts that the Higgs boson itself, should be very heavy, beyond the reach of earth-based experiments, which can only produce particles up to a limited mass. This paradox is however explained if the Higgs itself is a composite of smaller particles (indeed, the mesons, the only particles that we have observed that have similar properties as the Higgs, are composite of the smaller quarks); this idea was dubbed "Composite Higgs Model".        Part of this project is dedicated to understand from the LHC data, whether the Higgs is indeed a composite of other smaller particles. This can be seen, for instance, by searching for other composites made by different combinations of the same constituents or by carefully studying the Higgs interactions with known particles (if it is a composite, its interactions are generally smaller than if it is not a composite).    Since the searches at LHC are guided by the theoretical expectations, it is important to understand what theories have to be looked for. For this reason, another part of this project is dedicated to understand what properties of a composite Higgs could have played a role in the generation of matter and whether such properties could be observed experimentally. Furthermore, it would be interesting if the large amounts of "dark" matter observed in the universe, could also be related with the Higgs.     In this way, searches in the microcosmos of particle physics, lead with unprecedented precision, could tell us something about the macrocosmos and the evolution of the universe, of which we know very little. Questions like "What is the universe made of? How was its matter created?" could be answered in a scientific context.
