 Lead Secure multi-party computation (in short, MPC), is a central problem in cryptography with direct applications to important  cybersecurity problems such as secure electronic voting, secure cloud computing, and database security. In a nutshell, it allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to compute an arbitrary function on their private data so that no (coalition of) parties learn any more information than their specified inputs and outputs (e.g., the outcome of the electronic election). This seemingly fictional problem has recently shifted from a mainly theoretical paradigm to a goal for practical security. Lay summary   My research aims to develop attack models for secure MPC which closer capture the attacker's capabilities, as well as flexible security models to create space for the design and analysis of  provably secure practical solutions, e.g., I will combine ideas from game theory and cryptography to capture realistic (incentive-driven) attacks. Parallel, and in combination with the relaxed models, I will work on efficiency optimizations targeted at instances of secure computation that address practical demands of the modern information society, such as computation in the cloud and on big datasets. The proposed research will provide the grounds for proving the security of practically useful protocols and advance in the direction of managing (and computing with) privacy-sensitive data. This will open new horizons for research and help prevent security breeches of complex multi-party systems. Furthermore to apply the ideas from the MPC literature to real-world applications and prove the security of our protocols in a robust and realistic attacking model constitutes a huge step to convince potential users to adopt them. A widespread deployment of such solutions will revolutionize the use of the Internet for performing tasks such as electronic banking, voting, and auctions.
