 Lead Lay summary Past few years have seen rapid growth in theoretical and experimental cosmology, leading to the concordance cosmological model, in which the energy content of the Universe is dominated by mysterious dark matter and dark energy. To understand the nature of dark sector of the Universe, an extraordinary number of large galaxy surveys have been developed, providing high signal-to-noise ratio measurements of galaxy clustering and weak lensing over a substantial dynamic range. However, galaxy bias, the difference between the galaxy and the underlying matter distributions, limits our ability to make full use of high precision measurements on small scales in inferring the underlying cosmology. In contrast, galaxy bias becomes simple on large scales, for which many ideas have been proposed to put constraints on models of dark energy and to test general relativity by using large-scale measurements. However, on cosmological scales, where different dark energy models or alternative theories of gravity deviate significantly, relativistic effects are not considered in the standard method of galaxy clustering and weak lensing, providing a source of significant systematic errors in the current and future surveys. Here I propose a series of analytical and numerical research projects to use galaxies as a cosmological probe of dark sector of the Universe. I will adopt the halo occupation distribution to model galaxy bias on nonlinear scales and I will perform relativistic perturbation calculations to provide correct general relativistic descriptions of galaxy clustering and weak lensing on linear scales. Applying my theoretical and numerical calculations to the current and future surveys will play a crucial role in determining the underlying cosmological parameters and testing general relativity on cosmological scales.
