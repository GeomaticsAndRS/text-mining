 Lead Lay summary Healthy individuals mount immune responses directed against pathogens while avoiding autoimmune attacks on their own tissues. This ability to distinguish between self and non-self is referred to as immunological self-tolerance. Natural regulatory T (nTreg) cells are pivotal players in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance because they possess the unique property of being able to prevent autoimmunity by suppressing the activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes. Deficiencies in nTreg cells consequently lead to severe autoimmunity in humans and mice. Although, the importance of nTreg cells in the immune system is well recognized, the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing their generation in the thymus remain unsolved. In particular, the precise identities of the stromal cells that promote and support nTreg development in the thymus remain unclear. The aim of this proposal is to define the respective contributions of different thymic stromal cells to nTreg development. One goal of the proposal is to determine the contribution of medullary thymic epithelial cells. These cells constitute attractive candidates because they express a broad range of peripheral tissue-restricted self-antigens that may be of particular relevance for the generation of an nTreg population. Another goal is to extend this study to other thymic stromal cells. The respective contributions of cortical thymic epithelial cells and thymic dendritic cells will be in particular analyzed. Taken together, the anticipated results will highlight the nature of the thymic stromal cells that drive the generation of nTreg cells, thereby furthering our knowledge on the mechanisms that establish and maintain immunological self-tolerance.
