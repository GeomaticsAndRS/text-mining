  Accessibility concepts are increasingly acknowledged as fundamental to understand the functioning of cities and urban regions. In particular, accessibility instruments are able to provide a framework for understanding the reciprocal relationships between land use and mobility. Such a framework has important potential advantages when transferred to the realm of urban planning. However, despite the large number of instruments available in literature, they are not widely used to support urban planning practices. Significant benefits are expected, both in terms of process - the establishment of bridges between scholars and practitioners from different approaches and different domains - and in terms of results - insights on how to improve the relevance of accessibility instruments for urban planning practices.
