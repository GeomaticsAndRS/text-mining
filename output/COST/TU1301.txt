  The depletion of energy resourses and raw materials has a huge impact on the building market. In the development of new synthetic building materials the reuse of various (waste) residue streams becomes a necessity. This COST initiative stimulates the collaboration of scientists, industries and regulators to gather knowledge, experiences and technologies, to stimulate research on the reuse of residues containing enhanced concentrations of natural radionuclides (NORM) in tailor-made building materials in the construction sector while considering the impact on both external gamma exposure of building occupants and indoor air quality. By improving radiological impact assessment models for the reuse of NORM residues in building materials we hope to further stimulate justified uses of NORM residues in different types of newly developed building materials. Based on these models, we aim at investigating realistic legislative scenarios so that the authorities concerned can allow reuse pathways for NORM that can be accepted from a radioprotection point of view in concordance with the Lead Marked Initiative (LMI) and sustainable construction.
