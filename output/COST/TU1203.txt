  The objective of this Action  is to contribute to structuring existing knowledge and develop innovative approaches on how  to build more secure and safe cities. Studies have proved that there is a correlation between the structure and organization of urban space and crime: new criminological theory supports this point of view. The Justice and Home Affairs Council of the EU has underlined that crime prevention through design is a successful and effective strategy for crime prevention and needs to be supported. Despite this, new projects are being implemented all over Europe without considering safety criteria, creating urban areas where crime and fear of crime make life difficult. The Action   will develop new  knowledge and innovative approaches putting together  theoretical thinking and practical experience. Thus the  scientific  program  forecasts to work simultaneously on one hand on the innovative approaches deriving from research and experts, on the other hand on the know-how acquired through  best  practical experience of participating countries. This will be done through lectures,  seminars, focused working groups as well as a workshop. Dissemination of awareness is an important aspect for working in the field of CP- UDP field and the Action  devotes quite an effort on this issue. Central to this Action  is the  training of young people, for this purpose a Junior network as  well as specific training are forecasted. N.B. The term crime, according to the most recent definitions, covers a wide range: proper crime, anti-social behaviours, conflicts, fear of crime and other harmful behaviours.
