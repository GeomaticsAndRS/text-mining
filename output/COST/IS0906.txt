  The main objective of this Action  is to advance state-of-the-art knowledge of the key transformations of European audiences within a changing media and communication environment, identifying their interrelationships with the social, cultural and political areas of European societies. The Action  will coordinate research efforts into the key transformations of European audiences within a changing media and communication environment, identifying their complex interrelationships with the social, cultural and political areas of European societies. The Action  will offer a perspective which is different from that of conventional ICT -focused audience research, by (a) bringing together experts who study a wide range of media, old  mass media included, to understand how these relate to each other and to everyday life, and (b) paying equal attention to audience-focused issues (especially media interpretations and mediated experiences) and user-focused issues (both adoption and use of technologies). The Action  will be of benefit to the scientific and education communities, to media, communication and ICT  industries and professionals, to policy-makers and regulatory bodies, and to media-oriented NGOs and citizen initiatives.
