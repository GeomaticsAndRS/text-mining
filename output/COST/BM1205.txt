  The Action  will provide an interdisciplinary framework to enhance interaction activities within the field of optical biosensing, between world-class  academic groups, labs and system integrators from industry. It will exploit novel laser sources and innovative feedback interferometry in specific biomedical applications. Recent developments in the design of solid-state laser sources at near-infrared, mid-infrared and terahertz frequencies, coupled with novel self-mixing approaches to signal detection and the integration of these into imaging platforms, provide a way forward in the design of the next generation of detection systems. Specifically, we propose extending the noninvasive interrogation of skin tissue into these frequencies. The Action  will exchange knowledge, explore and compare technology platforms and perform clinical validation and evaluation of new devices which will permit detection of both the changes in skin lesions and disordered blood flow patterns and tissue perfusion typical of malignancy. The COST scheme is an ultimate choice for this network as it will bring together COST- countries academia, industry and clinical end-users which would be virtually impossible through any other European funding mechanism.
