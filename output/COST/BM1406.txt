  The function of ion channels in immune cells is an emerging field of great basic science and clinical interest because they provide powerful molecular targets to modulate immune cell function. The Ionchan-Immunrespon  network is a novel and exciting enterprise that involves internationally recognised scientists across 15 European countries. The specific aims are i) to develop a strong European workforce to understand the role of ion channels in immune cells, and how deregulation of their function can cause disease, ii) to identify new targets for therapeutic immuno-interventions through modulation of ion channels. Our unique combination of biophysical approaches combined with molecular biology, cell biology and immunology provides a powerful approach for dissecting the functional cell biology of the immune system. The Action  therefore will strengthen academic research in Immunology within Europe and foster closer collaborations with drug and diagnostics development programs in industry.
