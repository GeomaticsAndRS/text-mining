  The recent occurrence of large earthquakes and discovery of deep fluid seepage calls for a revision of the postulated hydrogeological inactivity and low seismic activity of old oceanic transform-type plate boundaries. Both processes are intrinsically associated. This Action  seeks to merge the expertise of a large number of research groups and support the development of multidisciplinary knowledge on how seep fluid (bio)chemistry relates to seismicity. It aims to identify (bio)geochemical proxies for the detection of precursory seismic signals and to develop innovative physico-chemical sensors for deep-ocean seismogenic faults. National efforts will be coordinated through Working Groups (WGs) focused on 1) geophysical and (bio)geochemical data acquisition; 2) modelling of structure and seismicity of faults; 3) engineering of deep-ocean physico-chemical seismic sensors and 4) integration and dissemination. Study areas include the Azores-Gibraltar Fracture Zone and the North Anatolian Fault which have generated some of the most devastating earthquakes in Europe.
