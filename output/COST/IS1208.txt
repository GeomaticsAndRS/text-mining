  Aphasia, a language problem due to stroke, affects the understanding and expression of spoken and written language. Communication with families, friends and the wider community may be severely affected. Altered social interaction isolates the person with aphasia and impacts on their emotional wellbeing. Aphasia contributes to poorer functional recovery, mobility, discharge destination and return to employment. With an aging population and improved stroke survival, the societal and economic burden of aphasia will rise. Effective management and rehabilitation of aphasia is vital. Aphasia research faces methodological and infrastructural challenges. Typically it remains language, region and discipline specific limiting the efficiency, strength and broader relevance of any research. This Action  aims to establish a network of leading European multidisciplinary aphasia investigators in rehabilitation, social science, linguistics and language research. This collaborative network will enhance knowledge, skills and methodology relating to aphasia research. Consensus activities will facilitate international synergy between members in aphasia assessment  diagnosis. Data sharing activities will support enhanced prognosis and rehabilitation of aphasia. In addition, this Action  will foster and coordinate the development of high quality aphasia research activity which will address the needs of people with aphasia and their families, health and social care providers and voluntary groups.
