  Timber and wood-based engineered products are becoming very important as structural materials, especially in the drive towards sustainable technologies and construction. For structural wooden products, it is very important to improve their properties to be more competitive and reliable as a sustainable low-carbon material and a major contributor to affordable buildings. This applies particularly to larger, more complicated structures where timber is becoming a realistic alternative. This Action  aims to boost the performance of structural timber products/construction, thereby improving use of timber in construction in existing and new applications. This includes the enhanced predictability and reliability of timber structures. Improving the mechanical performance of connections and reinforcing timber in weak zones are large-scale research domains in Europe which will require coordination and scientific/engineering approaches. This COST Action  will deliver increased knowledge of improving strengthening, stiffening and toughening techniques, modelling enhanced performance and experience in real projects to create new opportunities for timber construction. Exchanging information will highlight gaps in knowledge and inform future work and potential collaboration between research groups, supporting timber construction and its wider uptake in the European construction industry. This Action  may also create opportunities for patenting possible new technologies and products for reinforcing timber mechanical properties.
