  CARISMA will set the stage for an unprecedented Action  where the most advanced computational and experimental minds will meet to foster synergies with one priority mission: disruptive catalysis. The Action  will provide new processes for the selective and sustainable transformation of small and pervasive molecules like H 2 O, CO 2 , NH 3  into high-value chemical feedstocks and energy resources. CARISMA will promote new collaborations, lab-knowledge exchange, frontier training, and a virtual open-space to enable a strongly iterative advancement of theory and experiment, with input from experts in computational chemistry, spectroscopy, kinetics, catalysis, synthesis and materials science. Such interactions will spur the discovery of innovative catalytic processes and of advanced theory. Methods and concepts emerging from CARISMA will significantly shorten demands of time and resources for catalyst optimization, and will result in tailor-made systems with broad implications for fundamental and industrial areas.
