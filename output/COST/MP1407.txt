  Cost-effective device miniaturization is one of the most significant challenges faced by process engineering and industry. As systems are further miniaturized, component machining and assembly become increasingly complex and manufacturing costs grow. High-throughput, economical advanced manufacturing and assembly technologies are urgently required at the industrial level. Electrochemical processing and corrosion science are key disciplines for the integration and the protection of small functional parts in complex micro- and nanosystems. A transfer of knowledge among the electrochemical community, micro- and nanosystems researchers and associated industry is timely and urgently required. This COST Action  (e-MINDS) provides a unique networking platform that overcomes discipline fragmentation, strengthens European competiveness, and ensures scientific excellence.
