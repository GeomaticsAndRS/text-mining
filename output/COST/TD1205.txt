  Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment options for cancer patients. The physical properties of synchrotron-generated X-rays make them ideally suited for the design of new therapeutic approaches to treat both malignant and non-malignant diseases, in particular aggressive brain tumors. Centered around six multidisciplinary work groups, the COST teams will a) prepare for clinical trials in human patients preceded by, b) controlled trials in veterinary patients with spontaneous malignant tumours, c) preclinical studies in small animals, d) dosimetry, e) ethical aspects and patient care. SYRA3 will be an excellent coordination and communication tool for experienced scientists and Early Stage Researchers in the field of innovative radiotherapy  radiosurgery. International institutions and industrial partners are involved to apply standardization methods and for the dissemination/exploitation of results.
