  The main objective of the Action  is to promote basic research on hypoxia signalling pathways, accelerating scientific progress on the levels of basic science, technology, pharmacology and translational medicine, with the ultimate goal to exploit hypoxia signalling pathways for clinical application. Insufficient tissue oxygenation (hypoxia) occurs in a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions, including high altitude, embryonic development, wound healing, anemia, inflammation, cancer, and ischemic diseases such as infarction and stroke. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of hypoxia sensing, signaling and adaptation is important to exploit this signaling pathway for therapeutic applications. Towards this goal, the four most pressing problems in hypoxia research have been identified: basic science (function and interaction of the different oxygen sensing systems in our body); technology (detection of oxygen-dependent protein modifications); pharmacology (development of drugs modulating the oxygen signaling pathways); and translational medicine (function of these drugs in living organisms). An interdisciplinary COST Action  is considered to be the best way to bundle the already existing, widespread research activities in this field, ultimately accelerating the solution of these problems. The Action  will coordinate and strengthen European research on hypoxia signaling pathways and their exploitation for clinical application. Improved knowledge on hypoxia signaling is the basis for new therapies that serve patients' health, and it will be a driving force for new employment opportunities in Europe.
