  The main objective of the Action  is the specification, development and demonstration of cost-effective ground-based integrated profiling systems suitable for future networks providing essential atmospheric observations for both climate and weather.Climate and weather observations are essential for the development of climate change policies and weather services securing the safety and quality of life of the public. Atmospheric observing systems for GEOSS/GMES in Europe will be integrated to satisfy requirements for climate, environment and security. This Action  will coordinate deployment and further development of integrated ground-based remote sensing systems to provide key atmospheric variables such as clouds, winds, temperature and humidity. These systems observe at high time resolution providing observations of atmospheric processes relevant to climate and weather but will need to be cost-effective. Long term deployments (�testbeds�) of observing systems will be used to judge their effectiveness and cost-efficiency so design recommendations for the future European integrated observing network can be delivered. Development in data assimilation techniques will allow the observations to be fully exploited in numerical models. The observing infrastructure will also be used to evaluate and improve climate and weather forecast models, and to validate other observing systems, including satellite and aircraft.
