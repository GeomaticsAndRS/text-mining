  The main objective of the Action  is to harmonise research and practice on design and evaluation methodologies for computing artefacts, across sectors and disciplines. Third-wave human computer interaction (HCI) is characterised by a diversifying user base and use contexts, new emphasis on user experience and new interaction styles. This implies a need for informed method choice sensitive to domains, user groups and system objectives. Effective method use requires complex judgments about applicability across applications and genres, with failure implying significant financial and human costs. The adoption of ICT  across ages and abilities further increases the need for sound D E methods, which bring about useful, usable, desirable computing artefacts that improve life quality. Effective cross-sectorial transfer of design and evaluation (D E) methods is plausible and demonstrable. Relevant research work, however, is fragmented and scattered. The Action  aims to provide harmonization and leadership currently lacking in this field by bringing together researchers and D E professionals. Their broad experience of D E methods deployed in different sectors and disciplines enables comparison of method applications, assessing transferability of both established and novel approaches. These collaborative activities in Working Groups and open Workshops will facilitate production of a generic D E method selection and application framework and scientific publications reaching the wider research community. The Action  will also provide young interdisciplinary researchers with systematic training and networking opportunities such as STSMs and Training Schools.
