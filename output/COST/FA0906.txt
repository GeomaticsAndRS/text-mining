  The main objective of this Action  is to bring together, coordinate, and enhance the performance of nationally-funded research activities by forming a coherent, interdisciplinary research  training network that will develop an integrated vision on the regulatory role of UV-B in plant growth and development at cell, organism and ecosystem level. Significant new understanding of UV-B mediated processes in plants has been gained during the last decade. Rather than being a damaging agent, it is now recognised that UV-B radiation is a specific regulator of gene expression, metabolite profiles, and responses to climate change parameters. This COST- Action  will generate knowledge on the fundamentals of plant growth, food quality, and plant-environment interactions by integrating nationally and internationally funded research on UV-B mediated regulation of molecular, physiological, metabolic and ecological processes. The aim of this Action  is to develop an integrated vision of the role of UV-B in plant growth across a range of organisational levels and natural and agricultural systems.
