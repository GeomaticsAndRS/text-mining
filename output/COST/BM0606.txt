  1. Main Objective The main objective of this Action  is to provide reliable breast cancer risks associated with genetic variants, through collaborative epidemiological studies. Specifically, one aims to provide an evaluation of at least 60 genetic variants over the period of this Action . 2. Secondary objectives - To examine the combined effects of multiple risk factors. - To evaluate interactions between genetic and lifestyle risk factors. - To evaluate the evidence for genetic associations in particular subsets of breast cancer. - To examine evidence for associations between these variants and survival from breast cancer. - To facilitate exchange of expertise in genotyping technologies and analysis among participating countries. 3. Deliverables - Estimates of breast cancer risk, by age, associated with 60+ polymorphisms - Estimates of the combined effects of disease associated polymorphisms on breast cancer risk. - Risk estimates by genotype for each subtype of breast cancer. - Risk estimates by genotype and known lifestyle risk factors.
