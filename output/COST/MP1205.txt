  The aim of this Action  is to establish active interlinks between laboratories working in the fields of micro and optofluidics, optical tweezers, nanoscience and photonics, bio and soft materials, focusing their work towards lab-on-a-chip systems and at promoting long-term development of these fields in Europe. The goal is to increase the knowledge in basic physics and biology from the micro- down to the nano-scale, and to develop the future generation of lab-on-a-chip devices for portable and inexpensive, but accurate and reliable equipments for: (i) diagnostics; (ii) detection, identification and manipulation of biomolecules and nanomaterials, (iii) biomedical and environmental microsensing, (iv) advanced imaging, (v) energy generation. The scientific innovation concerns advanced concepts of optofluidics and new generation of optofluidic devices integrating photonics as well as optical control. Indeed, their technologically relevant research threads are of significant interest for the academic community and the industrial R D. In order to capitalize on recent achievements and go one step forward, a platform as a COST Action , promoting interdisciplinary activities, is a relevant tool to exchange expertises and to explore new opportunities coming from each specific insights and knowledge. The Action  will focus on selected scientific challenges and will be organized in three Working Groups: 1-Integrated microfluidic photonics (new concepts of optofluidics); 2-Optical control in microfluidics; 3-Materials (soft, bio and nano) and technologies for optofluidic devices.
