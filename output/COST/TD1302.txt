  Taenia solium  (pork tapeworm) and T. saginata  (beef tapeworm) cysticercosis (CC)/taeniosis are zoonoses of public health importance, with significant economic impacts on the health and meat (pork and beef) sectors within and outside the EU. Despite increased research efforts, an important number of gaps remain. For more than one third of the member states, data on occurrence of porcine/bovine/human CC and taeniosis are missing. Many questions remain on transmission dynamics, infection development/course and clinical manifestations. An improved knowledge on host-parasite interactions will create opportunities for new diagnostic targets, and vaccine candidates. The main objective of this Action  is to build a strong, extensive, multi-disciplinary scientific network to induce sustainable collaborations with the aim to advance knowledge and understanding of these zoonotic disease complexes. Specific objectives include the development of innovative diagnostic and cost-efficient control tools, assessments of disease burden and economic impact, as well as the development of harmonized reporting and management procedures. Intra-European collaboration is essential to stop the development of these diseases within the EU. The Action  is aimed at both European economical/societal needs and scientific/technological advances.
