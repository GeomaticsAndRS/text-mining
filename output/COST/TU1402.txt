  This COST Action  enhances the benefit of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by novel utilization of applied decision analysis on how to assess the value of SHM - even before it is implemented. This improves decision basis for design, operation and life-cycle integrity management of structures and facilitates more cost efficient, reliable and safe strategies for maintaining and developing the built environment to the benefit of society. SHM is increasingly applied for collecting information on loads and aggressive environments acting on structures, structural performances, deterioration processes and changes in the use of structures. However, there is an urgent need to establish a better understanding of the value of SHM before its implementation, together with practically applicable methods and tools for its quantification. This Action  thus aims to develop and describe a theoretical framework, together with methods, tools, guidelines, examples and educational activities, for the quantification of the value of SHM. The COST Action  will be conducted with the support of the Joint Committee on Structural Safety (JCSS). The networks of researchers and industries established during COST Actions  TU0601, C26, E55 and E24, the EU FP7  project IRIS, the Marie Curie Network SmartEn and the JCSS will ensure visibility, impact and dissemination.
