  The aim of the Action  is to establish active scientific exchange between European experts for the development of the emerging category of Coherent Raman (CoR) microscopy techniques â  the optical correspondent to MRI, enabling non-invasive tomographic imaging of molecular species in innovative materials and living matter with high specificity at sub-wavelength resolution by probing natural molecular vibrations. Specifically we intend to: (i) offer networking opportunities for the scientific and technical communities of laser instrumentation, microscopy, spectroscopy, and ultrafast optics for efficient development of the broad range of technologies required for CoR microscopy; (ii) reach out to potential users within the material-, nano-, chemical-, bio- and life sciences to push CoR microscopy beyond proof-of-principle measurements, and (iii) to attract the interest of the next generation of promising scientists by outreach activities and thereby ascertain that Europe remain at the frontline of microscopy research in the increasing competition from Asia and America.
