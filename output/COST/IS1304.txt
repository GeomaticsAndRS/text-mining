  Most governments and the new European Union Chief Scientist support the concept of evidence-based decision-making in policy. However, there is a substantial gap between the science models relevant for cutting-edge research and those required for policy analysis. Science-based models often involve substantial uncertainty which require defensible and timely characterisation. The shortage and cost of timely empirical data inevitably requires scientific expert judgment. How this is best elicited is critical to a decision process, as differences in the robustness of elicitation methods can be substantial. Good examples, pioneered in Europe, do exist in specific areas of science, but generalizing and spreading this good practice into other disciplines is hard. Performed rigorously, expert elicitation and mapping of stakeholders  views are powerful means for obtaining rational and scientifically founded assessments of uncertainty. This Action  will utilize the COST framework to stimulate the emergence and spread of high quality evidence-based decision support methods to ensure that scientists can have a stronger influence on policy questions by interacting with policy makers and Chief Scientist offices. By including training for young scientists the Action  helps create a new generation of scientists who are confident and able to bridge the gaps between science and policy.
