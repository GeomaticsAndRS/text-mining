  International law faces several structural changes: from the advent of asymmetric wars, the war on terror, the resurrection of targeted killings, piracy to the degradation of the global environment or the challenges posed by the global economic crisis. These challenges escape the constitutive confines of the state system and require new answers. The current literature treats fragmentation, politicization and constitutionalisation as separate or opposite trends in the international legal order. This Action  takes as a vantage point that they have to be thought together as dimensions of a more fundamental systemic change. This Action  therefore brings together scholars from a variety of disciplines to analyze this complex relationship and assess the changing structure of the legal system.
