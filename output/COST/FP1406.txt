  Gibberella circinata  is a highly virulent pathogen damaging pines, causing damping-off in nurseries and pitch canker in forests. It was first detected in North America, since when the pathogen has spread into Central and South America, South Africa, Asia and, more recently, Europe. G. circinata  is now considered the most important pathogen affecting Pinus  seedlings and mature trees in many countries globally; asymptomatic seedlings may be planted out, resulting in very serious losses in forests. Nevertheless, there has been little research on G. circinata  in Europe to date and little information is available overall on host range in Europe, pathogen spread and disease control. The main aim of this Action  is to establish a European-focused network to increase knowledge of the biology, ecology and pathways of spread of G. circinata , to examine the potential for the development of effective and environmentally-friendly prevention and mitigation strategies and to deliver these outcomes to stakeholders and policy makers. To that end, a multidisciplinary approach will be taken, including researchers, forest managers and policy makers from (initially) 27 countries focused on the common problem of pitch canker, making PINESTRENGTH highly innovative.
