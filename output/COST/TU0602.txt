  Previous studies in urban development show the decisive importance of the public actorï¿½s ability to mobilize the required land resources for the success of urban projects. European cities largely differ from each other in their land ownership situation, building industry and real estate configurations, mortgage system, planning culture, policies, and management tools. However, the actual impacts of those differences on the success of urban development are poorly known, in spite of their utmost importance for European long term economic growth, especially for new Eastern EU members. COST offers an accurate framework to lead an Europe-wide comparative study that focuses on (1) land management regimes and land policies for urban development and regeneration, (2) land management tools for large urban development projects, and (3) the overall assessment of the performance of those regimes, policies, and tools. This action will benefit the scientific community as well as the political and administrative bodies, the practitioners, and the main stakeholders.
