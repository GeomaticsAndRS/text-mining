  New trends changing the structuring and functioning of the public sector are observed. Specialization within large bureaucracies results in the establishment of autonomous �agencies�, urging stricter coordination of policy sectors and governmental levels, and new ways of contract-based result control. Although governments are adapting to these trends at an increasing pace, there remains lack of scientific proof of the beneficial effects of these trends for the performance of the public sector. Most research efforts suffer from a lack of internationally comparative data, longitudinal data, and ill-concerted research methods. This Action  resolves these drawbacks by bringing together scholars on a European platform for comparative and longitudinal research, which will lead to empirical, theoretical and methodological advancements in the field. Also, results that are grounded in scientific research will inspire policy-relevant recommendations to guide decision-makers in their policies on the organization of the public sector.
