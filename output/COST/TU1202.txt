  There is an urgent need to assess the risks posed by climate change on our already ageing infrastructure and to plan adaptations that both increase safety and reduce the cost of repairs. Engineered slopes (cuttings, embankments, flood defences) are a critical component of this infrastructure. Many of these slopes are now exhibiting excess deformation, which are threatening the serviceability of the infrastructure and dwellings nearby and causing delays and subsequent economic loss to European industry and the general public, while posing a safety hazard. The aim of the Action  is to build a coalition of researchers equipped to address the challenges of engineered slope infrastructure resilience and adaptation to climate change. This group will develop collective understanding, share techniques, facilities and data, and work jointly in disseminating results across the EU and to asset owners. Ultimately, the Action  will enable infrastructure asset owners to make evidence based investment and adaptation decisions to improve resilience and safety.
