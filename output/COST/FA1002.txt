  There is an increasing awareness of the potential of proteomic technologies to study production animals but the use of proteomic strategies to investigate animal health and disease has been limited by the lack of international coordination and collaboration. The COST Action  will form a network of the leading European scientists who are focused on farm animal proteomics; this network will benefit the European Research Area scientific community by providing a conduit for the rapid dissemination of knowledge on the techniques and applications of this rapidly advancing area. It will benefit the European economy by providing advanced analytical tools to enhance animal production, health and welfare, as well as in the assessment of food quality and safety related to the protein in food produced from animal origin.
