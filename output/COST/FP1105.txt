  The primary objective of the Action  is to build knowledge and understanding of fundamental physical (self assembly) processes and biological systems (e.g. genetic control) that drive natural structures and biopolymer composition within the plant/wood cell wall and to use new knowledge of self assembly processes to support the development of new biopolymer based materials. The Action  also aims to quantify the impact of new knowledge on our understanding of the mechanical properties of the cell wall and how processes such as pulping, bleaching recycling, cell wall disintegration methods and ongoing tree improvement and biotechnology programmes impact both positively and negatively on structure and composition of the cell wall.  The intent is to explore how this knowledge can be used to support ongoing improvement in these areas of activity.   An overarching goal is to develop multidisciplinary competence and capability to support these objectives and to work closely with commercial organisations to promote effective dissemination of knowledge and the development of a more economically sustainable Forest Based Sector.
