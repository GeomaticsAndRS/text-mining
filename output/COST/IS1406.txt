  Oral language (speaking and understanding) is critical to children's development, affecting the emergence of personal, social and academic skills throughout school and into the workplace. Most children acquire such skills effortlessly but a sizeable proportion, those with Language Impairment (LI), do not. LI affects 5.8 million children and young people (0-18 years) across Europe. There is evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of intervention to improve the language skills of these children but this information is not well disseminated and services are inconsistent across Europe. This Action  will enhance the science in the field, improve the effectiveness of services for children with LI and develop a sustainable network of researchers well placed to answer the key questions in this area. The Action  will have 3 Working Groups comprising established/ early stage researchers and practitioners: 1. The linguistic and psychological underpinnings of interventions for LI; 2. The delivery of interventions for LI; 3. The social and cultural context of intervention for children with LI. This activity has never been attempted before despite there being services for these children in all European countries. The COST framework is the ideal mechanism for catalysing activity to promote research collaboration and produce to high quality outputs.
