  "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us closer to the secret of the 'Old One.' I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice." (Einstein, 1926) . This view on quantum mechanics is now shared by a large number of scientists spanning the entire spectrum of physics, from pure theoretical analysis to cutting edge experiments. Europe has the largest number of scientists working on the fundamental problems of quantum mechanics.  They see an urgent need to create a common platform to overcome the existent fragmentation. They see the need of unifying their research in a multidisciplinary and coordinated approach, to reach the goal of a full understanding of the quantum world. This COST Action  will be the first network in the world, focussed on the foundations of quantum mechanics. The Action  aims at strengthening the cooperation and boosting the research activity among European groups working in the foundations of quantum mechanics. By combining existing research strengths in mathematical, theoretical and experimental physics and quantum chemistry, major breakthroughs in foundational questions will be achieved. The Action  will create the necessary platform for enhancing synergies among the participants, exchanging knowhow, coordinating the research and disseminating the results.
