  The main objective of the Action  is to facilitate and improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of MPD and related diseases in European countries. Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and related diseases are chronic blood diseases which had known little improvement in diagnosis and treatment for decades. In 2005 the discovery in Europe of the V617F mutation of JAK2 in MPD has renewed interest in these diseases. Since 2005, other mutations have been discovered in MPD and related diseases. New diagnosis tools will be designed and novel drugs will soon be tested. The objective of this COST Action , which regroups the main leaders in the field of MPD research, diagnosis and patient care, is to establish a European Network of experts in MPD and related diseases, MPD-EuroNet. This Action  will formalize collaboration between European MPD experts in order to facilitate, optimize and standardize diagnosis and care for MPD patients in Europe. The network will centralize the diagnostic investigation of rare forms of MPD and related diseases.
