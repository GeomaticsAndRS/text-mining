  A challenging area of anaerobic digestion (AD) research remains largely unchartered with respect to understanding the role of trace metals (TMs) in enabling biogas production. This major knowledge gap and scientific challenge is a multifaceted problem involving metal chemistry, physical interactions of metal and solids, microbiology and technology optimisation. Moreover, the fate of TMs, and the chemical speciation and transport of TMs, in environments - often agricultural lands - receiving discharge waters from AD is completely unknown. The Action  aims to grow a critical mass of stakeholders interested in understanding trace metal bioavailability and microbial interactions in anaerobic environments and soils. Five working groups (i.e. Chemical speciation and bioavailability; Microbiology; Engineering; Fate of TMs in the environment; and Modeling) are defined, where cooperation between, and integration of, the working groups will be emphasized. The COST Action  will allow the establishment of a strong European network, including Early-Stage Researchers. The problem has major environmental, economic and social significance, and the network will disseminate findings to the scientific community, water industry, policy makers and the rest of society.
