  The investigation of quantum phenomena in nanophotonics systems may lead to new scales of quantum complexity and constitutes the starting point for developing photonic technologies that deliver quantum-enhanced performances in real-world situations. This ambition demands new physical insight as well as cutting-edge engineering, with an interdisciplinary approach and a view towards how such groundbreaking technologies may be implemented and commercialized. The Action  aims at promoting and coordinating forefront research in nanoscale quantum optics (NQO) through a competitive and organized network, which will define new and unexplored pathways for deploying quantum technologies in nanophotonics devices within the European research area. The main vision is to establish a fruitful and successful interaction among scientists and engineers from academia, research centers and industry, focusing on quantum science  technology, nanoscale optics  photonics, and materials science. The Action  will address fundamental challenges in NQO, contribute to the discovery of novel phenomena and define new routes for applications in information  communication technology, sensing  metrology, and energy efficiency. Gathering a critical mass of experts the Action  will serve as a platform in NQO and as such it will cooperate with industry and academia to promote innovation and education in a forefront research field.
