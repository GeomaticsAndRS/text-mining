  This Action  will address the fundamental new challenges in the design and analysis of methods for collective decision making raised by recent technological advances in areas such as social networks, electronic commerce, webpage ranking, and e-governance. Computational Social Choice is a novel and innovative research trend that is now gathering substantial momentum, especially in the European research arena. It combines methods from Computer Science with insights from Economic Theory. The Action  will provide a much needed framework for coordinating research efforts in this important new field at the European level. The scientific programme will focus on four thematic areas: (1) voting and elections, (2) fair division, (3) information merging, and (4) matching mechanisms. In organisational terms, the Action  will particularly emphasise the close involvement of Early-Stage Researchers.
