  The Main Objective of the Action  is to gain new understanding of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes as they occur in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, so as to facilitate development of improved therapies by drawing together knowledge from study of individual diseases. The Operational Goal of this Action  is to create a network of basic scientists and clinical researchers with expertise in inflammation and degenerative disease of the brain, in order to: 1. Integrate studies, approaches and techniques for study of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, 2. Train young researchers by cross-cutting exposure to all aspects of these two major diseases, and, 3. Provide scientific insight that guides clinical research and practice. Targeted goals within this operational framework To improve and integrate understanding of these diseases with specific reference to: - Gene expression/repression in disease - Blood-brain interactions - Cellular dynamics of inflammation in the CNS - Demyelinating pathology - Degenerative pathology - Inflammation-associated neurodegeneration and regeneration - Glial responses and signalling - Immune regulation - Neuro- and glio-genesis and cell replacement The components listed are crucial to success, as well as realistic in view of the expertise in participating laboratories and groups to be recruited. These components are combined to address key questions that guide development of therapies for MS and AD as well as other major neurological diseases in adults.
