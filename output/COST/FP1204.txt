  Green Infrastructure (GI) has recently gained prominence as a planning tool at regional and local levels. GI provides a range of ecosystem services, and new initiatives can build on state-of-the-art research and on delivery mechanisms such as urban forestry (UF). However, greater attention is needed on integrating the environmental and social benefits produced, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The COST Action  aims to: 1) increase the understanding of the role of UF in the context of GI from a scientific and a socio-economic perspective, in terms of the ecosystem services provided to people and to the urban environment; 2) to identify priorities and challenges for future research in the field; 3) to provide indicators and/or thresholds to be included by policy makers in local, national or international regulations about GI and UF; 4) to develop guidelines for GI planners and managers on how to implement GI approaches with an emphasis on linking the environmental and social services of UF. Undertaking a COST Action  on this topic is crucial because of the diversity of GI and UF approaches at European level and because of the need to create a structured interaction among scientists, citizens, policy makers and managers
