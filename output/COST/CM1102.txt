  Carbohydrates constitute the most abundant class of biomolecules on Earth. They have diverse biological roles ranging from energy storage to mediating interactions between living cells.  Carbohydrates that are attached to proteins, lipids and synthetic multivalent scaffolds (i.e. glycoconjugates) can be used as anti-adhesive drugs against bacteria or viruses, or bioimaging agents that can target specific tissues. However, they can also have applications in materials science as nanoscale building blocks for hydrogels and templates for making nano-structured hard materials. We aim to build a dynamic network across Europe focused on developing glycoconjugates for nanoscience applications. We will develop new methods for producing nanomaterials for applications in drug delivery, in gene targeting and as diagnostic/prognostic tools. The Action  will foster new collaborations to transform glycoconjugate research in Europe by establishing a new frontier at the interface with nanoscience.
