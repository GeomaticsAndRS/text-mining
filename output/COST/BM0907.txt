  The main objective of this Action  is to define and characterize the immunotype  of healthy individuals and patients with immune mediated inflammatory diseases before, during, and after targeted immunomodulation. Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are characterized by dysregulation of the immune response, leading to chronic disorders that affect organ integrity and function. The burden of disease and socio-economic impact of IMIDs in the Western world are comparable to those for infectious diseases or malignancies. The major challenge in the field of IMIDs is not only to unravel their pathogenesis, but also to translate the newly available therapeutic options into optimal personalized care. One key step is the rational measurement of the functional immune status in individual patients that provides crucial information relating to staging, treatment choice, monitoring of efficacy, safety and dose adjustment of immunomodulation, as well as biological assessment of remission. The knowledge and technology required to define such an immunotype  is currently dispersed within centres with expertise in specific pathways or organ-specific diseases. The ENTIRE- Action  will harness the multidisciplinary synergy between different European centres in the field of immunology to define, validate, and implement a rational and standardized measurement of the immune function for IMIDs and their treatment. Building on the unique European model of structural integration between fundamental and clinical research, the Action  will ultimately promote the translation of new developments into optimal individualized treatment of IMIDs.
