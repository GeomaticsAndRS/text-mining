  This Action  focuses on the exchange of scientific-technical knowledge and experience of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) techniques in Civil Engineering (CE). The project will be developed within the frame of a unique approach based on the integrated contribution of University researchers, software developers, geophysics experts, Non-Destructive Testing equipment designers and producers, end users from private companies and public agencies. In this interdisciplinary Action , advantages and limitations of GPR will be highlighted leading to the identification of gaps in knowledge and technology. Protocols and guidelines for EU Standards will be developed, for effective application of GPR in CE. A novel GPR will be designed and realized: a multi-static system, with dedicated software and calibration procedures, able to construct real-time lane 3D high resolution images of investigated areas. Advanced electromagnetic-scattering and data-processing techniques will be developed. The understanding of relationships between geophysical parameters and CE needs will be improved. Freeware software will be released, for inspection and monitoring of structures and infrastructures, buried-object localization, shape reconstruction and estimation of useful parameters. A high level training program will be organized. Mobility of early career researchers will be encouraged. The project has already received the interest of key end users and excellent EU Institutions.
