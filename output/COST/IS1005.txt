  Medieval Cultures  Technological Resources (Medioevo Europeo) groups experts from all over Europe to create a Virtual Centre for Medieval Studies: a virtual, team work space in which to collaborate, communicate and share work and research tools. Medioevo Europeo fits into the COST framework as it coordinates existing research on the use of ICT  for Medieval Studies, a field where ICT  has potential to improve and substantiate research, and specifically on interoperability between databases used for storage and research in this area. Through 4 years of cooperation, Medioevo Europeo links modern technology to medieval studies and combines technological development with intensive training of researchers. The European framework offers the means to connect the wealth of scientific material available, while ensuring interoperability, data security, and suitability for differing academic contexts. The Action  includes 4 interrelated Working Groups, relating to Authors and texts; Manuscripts and textual tradition; Textual Corpora and Reading Tools, VCMS design. Medioevo Europeo promotes social, technological and scientific advances. It promotes an understanding of Europe as a union of diverse but complimentary heritages. It develops a key scientific resource and defines improved technical standards for academic databases. It promotes researcher employability through extensive skill enhancement.
