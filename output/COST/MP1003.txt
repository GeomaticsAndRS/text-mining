  The objective of this Action  is to foster and accelerate long-term advancement of artificial muscle  science and technology based on electroactive polymers (EAPs) as smart actuation materials, through a scientific network among leading European institutions and industries. Research and development on EAP materials and devices is a well established scientific field, bridging material science, mechanical and electrical engineering, and medical disciplines. In Europe, a number of world-leading research institutes with consolidated expertise in this field have formed an informal network, called ESNAM. A COST Action  intends to provide content and form to this network through coordination of mutual research activities and creation of a common platform for education, dissemination, early-stage researcher training, standardisation of methods, techniques and processes, along with industrial exploitation. This will represent, at global level, the first example of its kind, able to strengthen the impact of European science and technology. Partners involved in this Action  intend to stretch forward their networking activities well beyond the inevitably limited time frame of this Action , especially by preparing a road-map aimed at merging both research and industrial perspectives and needs, so as to properly target the wide-spread use of the EAP technologies in the European industry.
