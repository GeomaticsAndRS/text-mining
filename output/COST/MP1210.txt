  Although String Theory has been around for more than forty years, it has never been so important for physical reality as it is now, due to its novel outstanding applications to different areas of Physics and Mathematics. While the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) narrows down the experimental limits on supersymmetric particles and satellite missions such as WMAP and PLANCK probe the very early Universe, this Action  aims at creating a strong European Network focused on fundamental, forefront research exploring the role played by String Theory in Particle Physics, Cosmology and Condensed Matter Physics. The large majority of European world experts in String Theory will be involved in this Action . This will ensure a top quality research output, achieved through an intense exchange of expertise, intra-European collaboration and co-organization of scientific activities. The Action  will ensure fair gender representation and simultaneously adopt specific measures for promoting the involvement of women scientists at all levels. Moreover, it will foster the active participation of junior excellent scientists. The outcome of the Action  is expected to have a positive impact on both science and society at a European level, in line with the strategic priorities of COST.
