  One of the most promising emerging medical imaging modalities is Microwave Imaging (MWI), which is a low-power, low-cost, non-ionising imaging modality and also has therapeutic capabilities. Most of this MWI research to date has been accomplished in simulation and laboratory studies, with only limited translational research into the clinical environment. European researchers have been at the forefront of the development of MWI. With respect to medical applications, these (mostly independent) efforts have lead to the design of several microwave-based imaging devices, most of which are currently undergoing or poised for clinical trials. Such a reserve of knowledge constitutes a unique opportunity for European researchers to leverage existing experience and expertise to streamline the transition from simulation/phantom testing to full clinical trials and clinical adoption of MWI devices. Collaboration will provide a valuable non-competitive framework which will provide European researchers with the necessary structure and support to overcome common challenges and bring MWI from research bench to patient bedside  in a much shorter period of time, boosting the European Research Area ( ERA ) and its excellence in a worldwide context. Experience in the commercial evaluation of MWI devices will also be shared amongst COST participants.
