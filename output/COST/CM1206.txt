  The objective of this Action  is to coordinate European research activities and knowledge exchange on ionic liquids (ILs, low melting salts, many of them liquid at room temperature and below) and to explore their full potential in the context of fundamental and applied chemistry, materials science and engineering. The COST Action  will provide a coordinated forum for; an efficient intra- and interdisciplinary knowledge and expertise exchange, networking and dissemination of information and results, training and initiating collaborations, harmonizing research activities, establishing an open public database and supplying the scientific community with systematic high quality information on ILs and their applications. The Action  aims to combat misinformation as well as contradicting data and reports. EXIL will facilitate technology transfer from university to industry, enhance the supply routes of trained researchers from universities to industry, and structure the European science base. Transferring ILs from the laboratory workbench to true beneficial applications is the long-term goal of EXIL - the European exchange network on Ionic Liquids. An IL-COST action will lead to an improvement of everyday life through new and improved technologies and materials, not to mention cleaner and safer production techniques and will thus contribute to strengthening European research and economy.
