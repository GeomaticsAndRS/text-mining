  A plethora of new applications for novel RF/microwave subsystems is being introduced as new communication and security systems, radar, surveillance, and positioning services are becoming available. Such systems include mobile networks (4G), wireless communications systems (WiMAX, WiBRO, WiFIBER, UWB), radar, satellite navigation systems (GPS, Galileo), and sensor networks. Theoretical advances in signal processing lead to the conception of new architectures, applications, and a better use of the capacity of the underlying media. These advances, in turn, push the performance requirements of the analog front-ends to their limits. In order to fulfil the complex requirements of the new systems it is necessary to bridge the gap between the signal processing and the RF/microwave electronics communities by bringing together experts to collaborate towards the implementation of better communication subsystem design and optimization methodologies. On one hand, analog circuit design is improved by more accurately taking into account the properties of the transmitted signals. On the other hand, signal processing techniques for novel system architectures are also optimized by taking into consideration the properties of the analog front-end. Within this context, a balanced mix of experienced researchers, selected representatives from the European industry, and young researchers is brought together, to define the future subsystem requirements, applications, and trends.
