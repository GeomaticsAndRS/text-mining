  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, microscopy and imaging techniques (MRI) play a crucial role in numerous fields of science ranging from physics, chemistry, material sciences, biology to medicine. However, despite all their versatility, the key issue is frequently sensitivity, which limits the applicability of NMR spectroscopy and imaging techniques in the case of fast dynamical processes and detection of low concentrated molecules in both in vitro  and in vivo  applications. The Action  aims to stimulate and accelerate collaborations and joint research efforts between European groups into hyperpolarization physics and methodology with the goal to develop robust strategies for sensitivity enhancement in NMR and MRI. Coordinated short-term scientific missions (STSMs) will make it possible to fully exploit the potential of unique scientific instrumentation which already exists in a number of European groups. Summer schools and workshops will provide education and training for the early stage researchers that are entering the interdisciplinary research field. The scientific programme is organised into 5 different working groups that focus on key issues related to the topic of the Action . The scientific programme of this Action  is supported by a wide range of research groups thus generating a high added value for the European research landscape.
