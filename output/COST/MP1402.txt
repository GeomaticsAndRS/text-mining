  This Action  aims to structure and integrate European research activity in atomic layer deposition (ALD), bringing together existing groups, promoting young scientists and reaching out to industry and the public. ALD is a unique technique for growing ultra-thin films that is enabling new developments in high-tech manufacturing sectors such as electronics, energy and coatings. With interest growing worldwide, the time is right to coordinate European activity in this field, which until now has been fragmented, despite the presence of world-leading research groups and companies. The scientific collaborations in the Action  will cover new processes (precursor chemicals and equipment), fundamental understanding (metrology and modeling), innovative materials (nanoscale interfaces, 2D materials) and applications (semiconductor devices, photovoltaics, energy storage, sensors, protective coatings for organic elements and fibers). Networking activity will consist of student bursaries, topical workshops, conference sponsorship, joint publications and marketing. It is intended to establish a framework for this activity in Europe that will outlast the duration of the Action  and ensure Europe s leading position into the future.
