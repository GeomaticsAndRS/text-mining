  The main objective of the Action  is to produce a �roadmap� or �manual� conceptualizing the development of a technical infrastructure for collaborative digital preparing, editing, publishing, analyzing and visualizing of literary research materials. There is a great need for international cooperation in the development of tools for scholarly digital editing and analysis of literary material. Research groups from individual institutes exchange research results through conferences and journals and report on their methodological advances, but these results and advances often cannot be scientifically verified or tested because the used hardware and software is not available to or easy to use by other researchers. A shared technical infrastructure for the preparation, editing, publishing, analysis and visualization of literary material does not exist. This Action  aims to form an international Management Committee of researchers that have a thorough experience in electronic editing and digital text analysis for scholarly purposes in a national context. A series of meetings will be called for researchers in the field of literary research and information technology to meet on the topic of a shared supranational networked infrastructure for digital scholarly editing and analysis. The Action  will deliver a roadmap for the implementation of such an infrastructure. Keywords: tools development, interoperability, usability, scholarly cooperation and collaboration, scholarly digital infrastructure.
