  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent neoplasms worldwide and an important cause of morbidity in the developed world. It is necessary to identify individuals with a medium-high CRC risk in order to develop adequate preventive measures. The identification of inherited genetic factors involved in CRC susceptibility can help to profile individual disease risk and may enable early screening and treatment monitoring. Participants interested in networking in this Action  include 19 research groups actively working on CRC genetics with high success and with access to more 50,000 CRC cases and 50,000 controls through cohorts in 11 countries. This Action  will permit to articulate the cooperation between these research groups in Europe in order to comprehensively understand the impact of inherited susceptibility to CRC and to describe the genetic landscape of this disease, providing a highly innovative and unconditional tool for personalized CRC medicine with a future application in early screening and treatment monitoring for this disease.
