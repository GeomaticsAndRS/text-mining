  The main objective is making automated reasoning techniques and tools applicable to a wider range of problems, as well as making them easier to use by researchers, software developers, hardware designers, and information system users and developers. The Action  coordinates activities on developing infrastructures for automated reasoning about the new notion of Rich Models of computer systems. Rich Models have the expressive power of a large fragment of formalizable mathematics, enabling specification of software, hardware, embedded, and distributed systems. Rich Models support modeling at a wide range of abstraction levels, from knowledge bases and system architecture, to software source code and detailed hardware design. The Action  contributes to the construction of Rich-Model Toolkit, a new unified infrastructure that precisely defines the meaning of Rich Models, introduces standardized representation formats, and incorporates a number of automated reasoning tools. Moreover, the Action  develops and deploys new tools for automated reasoning that communicate using these standardized formats. The resulting tools will have a wide range of applicability and improved efficiency, helping system developers construct reliable systems through automated reasoning, analysis, and synthesis.
