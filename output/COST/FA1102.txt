  This Action  aims to optimise non-destructive in vivo(iv) and post mortem (pm) imaging and spectroscopic methods for the measurement of body composition and meat quality (MQ) in major farm animal species and to devise standardised principles of carcass classification and grading (CCG) across countries. These actions are necessary for the development of value-based payment and marketing systems (VBMS) and to meet the urgent need for market orientated breeding programmes. FAIM encompasses collaboration of hard- and software manufacturers with livestock and imaging academic experts to develop required products for implementing the scientific work. FAIM will coordinate and strengthen EU scientific and technical research through improved cooperation and interactions. This will be essential for achieving the required advances in CCG systems to measure carcass yield and MQ, to meet the industry need for VBMS, and to improve production efficiency throughout the meat supply chain (MSC). FAIM will also support EU legislation on individual animal identification through showing the additional benefits of feeding back abattoir data on individual animals for optimising management, breeding and providing phenotypic information which will facilitate future implementation of genome wide selection.
