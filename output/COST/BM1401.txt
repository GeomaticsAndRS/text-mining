  The aim of the Action  is to develop a collaborative network of top European experts working towards the progress of the emerging field of Raman-based applications for clinical diagnostics. The Action  coordinates research run by diverse yet complementary research groups in Europe on novel, label-free and rapid technologies based on a wide variety of Raman spectroscopies for the clinical diagnostics of body fluids, bacteria, cells and tissues. International interdisciplinary networking opportunities are offered between scientists within biophotonics, chemometricians and physicians/clinicians. Main goal of the network is to give a major impetus in this vibrant field of research by aligning it to clinical requirements and application aspects (the unmet medical need) by means of COST as the best mechanism to progress the state-of-the-art. The Action  will create a platform for scientific communication, exchange, collaboration and for new research activities, combining the partners  expertise in technology, component, system and methodology development and medical application. As a result, novel technology portfolios for clinical diagnostics will emerge to the benefit of patients as well as to the economy. The interest of the next generation of promising scientists will be attracted, thereby ensuring that Europe will remain at the frontline of research into clinical diagnostics.
