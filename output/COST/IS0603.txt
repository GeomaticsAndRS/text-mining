  The recent increase in the numbers of migrants in Europe has generated a growing volume of research on their state of health and the need to adapt care services to their needs. Scientific progress in this field, however, is held up by a lack of interdisciplinary and international collaboration. Moreover, the addition of a cross-national perspective can yield new insights into the causes of ill-health and can further the exchange of good practices. In Southern, Central and Eastern European Countries, work on migration and health is in particular need of strengthening and encouragement. This Action  will bring together an international group of experts to consolidate and review work carried out so far, identify blind spots and persistent problems, and recommend ways forward. Its three Working Groups will be concerned with social and policy factors, migrants' state of health, and improvements in service delivery. The Action  will produce 'state of the art' reports on the most urgent themes and will organise workshops, conferences, joint publications and training activities to discuss and disseminate its findings.
