  This COST Action  relates to bacterial infections seen in the human hereditary disease Cystic Fibrosis  (CF). This is the most common lethal single gene disorder in Europe and is associated with end organ inflammation and damage particularly affecting the lungs. The bacterial factors and the molecular mechanisms which provoke full blown inflammation in CF are mostly unclear. The COST Action  will investigate the structure, function and immunostimulatory activity of CF pathogens including Gram negative and Gram positive cell wall components. These pathogens particularly Pseudomonas , Acinetobacter  and S.  aureus  are also important causes of hospital acquired infections  affecting many other patient groups thus improving made within this COST Action  may have much wider applicability to include immunosuppressed or hospitalised patients who are also at risk from these bacteria.
