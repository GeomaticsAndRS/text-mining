  The primary aim of the proposed Action  is to create a Europe-wide network of world leading academic and research institutions and key industries to promote the use of smart energy carriers on a large scale in order to increase fuel flexibility and carbon efficiency of energy production and to support distributed energy generation strategies. The approach to accomplish this aim is twofold. On the one hand, academic/research organizations will devote strong efforts to bring together fundamental/advanced numerical and diagnostic tools to improve the understanding of combustion kinetics and by-products formation of smart energy carriers at micro/meso-scale levels. On the other hand, the intended exchange between academic and industrial partners will support the optimization of tools developed in the Action  exploiting the way that smart energy carriers could be utilised at the macro-scale in advanced combustion technology devices. This interaction will lead to the identification of standards and criteria for development of a searchable database and Internet tool devoted to integration of experimental and numerical combustion chemical/physical data which will provide an easy access to such information relevant to smart energy carrier components.
