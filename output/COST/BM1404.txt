  In cancer, infection and inflammation, the immune system s function can be dysregulated, contributing to disease pathology. As part of this process, instead of fighting disease, immune cells may suppress beneficial immune responses and increase pathology. Despite their pathophysiological importance, the identity and biology of the so called myeloid regulatory cells (MRCs) is poorly understood. Depending on the MRC subtype and the respective disease, conflicting results have been published. This Action  will form a network of researchers and clinicians which aims to establish a gold standard of common protocols and harmonizing guidelines for the analysis and clinical monitoring of MRCs. There is also a deficit in the translation of findings from animal models to humans, and Mye-EUNITER will build an analytical mouse-monkey-man correlation line. Standardized and validated tools for MRC analysis will aid the development of cellular biomarkers of disease and guide the design of novel therapies to manipulate the functions of MRCs.
