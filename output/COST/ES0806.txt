  The main objective of the Action  is to use stable isotopes on C, N, O and water cycles as a critical research tool in Biosphere-Atmosphere-Earth System research across scales and disciplines to: 1) synthesize isolated experiments in Europe to identify innovative process- and system-oriented research areas; 2) assess current state-of-the-art models to improve process representation and to better link experimental and modelling communities; 3) benchmark and advance innovative cutting-edge technologies; 4) create a training/teaching network across Europe.
