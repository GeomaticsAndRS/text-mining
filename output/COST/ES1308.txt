  Many climate change manipulation experiments have been carried out in recent decades. However, several challenges still exist or have emerged which limit our understanding of ecosystem functioning under future climate change. These include inadequate representation of biomes, artifacts, incomparable experiments, poor representation of relevant scenarios, in particular extreme events, lack of research communication sharing of results and lack of good data for modeling. This Action  will develop a network for the experimental climate change research community brining experimentalists and modelers together in order to provide solutions to these recurrent challenges. The Action  will organise workshops addressing key challenges in climate change experiments and modeling, support research exchange, educate young scientists and facilitate better sharing and access to experimental data. The Action  will be organised within four Working Groups to address: Experimental best practice Natural climate gradients as experimental proxies Data sharing Data-model interaction The Action  will provide added value to European climate change research by linking high level national research groups and projects to a supra-national level and provide strong links and interactions with the global research community.
