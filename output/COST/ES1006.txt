  Releases of hazardous agents in complex built environments pose a tremendous challenge to emergency first responders and authorities in charge due to the large number of casualties potentially involved. Air motions in built-up areas are very complex and adequate modelling tools have to be applied properly in order to predict the dispersion of hazardous materials with sufficient accuracy within a very short time. Different types of tools are applied; however, it is not always clear what the advantages and limitations of individual model approaches are. Therefore, it is of exceptional interest to compile a detailed inventory of the different models and methodologies currently in use, to characterize their performance and to establish strategies for their improvement. A consensus on reliable, efficient and suitable model approaches for given local threats and their scientific advancement is imperative. Consequently, the Action  is aiming for a substantial improvement in the implementation of local-scale emergency response tools. By characterizing threat scenarios, compiling dedicated test cases, revealing model limitations and improving model approaches, the Action  is delivering guidance for a reliable application of local-scale emergency response tools. The Action  is a first cross-community initiative to join, to coordinate and to harmonize European efforts in threat assessment and reduction for local-scale airborne hazards.
