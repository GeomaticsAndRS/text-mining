  Femicide is a leading cause of premature death for women globally, distinct from homicide and other forms of gender violence. Femicide research is abundant in the United States. In Europe, agencies have funded initiatives on gender and violence but not specifically on femicide. Research is in its infancy and uncoordinated. It requires an interdisciplinary approach, focusing on victim and perpetrator, upon cultural (e.g. honour killings ) and psychological causes, and on societal issues. The Action  will establish the first pan-European coalition on femicide with researchers who are already studying the phenomenon nationally, in order to advance research clarity, agree on definitions, improve theefficacy of policies for femicide prevention, and publish guidelines for the use of national policy-makers. Different forms of publications will emerge from the Action , such as articles, books, newsletters and an Action  internet site for the use of researchers, practitioners and policy-makers. Workshops will be held annually, adding advocates and researchers each year, and an Action  Conference will be held to attract stakeholders until the Action  will organise a pan-European conference to launch the idea of a European Observatory on femicide.
