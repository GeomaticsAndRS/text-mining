  This Action  undertakes coordinated research collaboration, at European level, in 3D multimedia creation, encoding, delivery and reception of services and applications over future networking technologies. A scientific framework is devised to integrate the main elements of the delivery chain, such as 3D content creation and encoding evolution, transmission across heterogeneous networks and user consumption, taking perceived quality as an overall key performance factor. Several individual R D efforts are currently running across Europe, targeted at 3D technologies. This Action  aims at beyond this trend by tightening closer together scattered efforts and integrating all technological elements with user 3D quality perception. To reach this goal, this Action  fuels cooperation between researchers and industry experts, envisaging production of technical and scientific deliverables for researchers, scientists, engineers and managers, new business model recommendations for content and service providers through joint meetings across academia and industry, plus documentation and multimedia presentations to promote 3D technology in the society. The benefits include increased relevancy of European research, contribution to the development and sustainability of new and better 3D multimedia communications technology and provision of a platform for faster launching and adoption of related new products and services across Europe for end users  beneficiary.
