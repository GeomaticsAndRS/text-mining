  The main objective of the Action  is cross-linking within a multi-disciplinary network European scientists with diverse expertise on plant natural products (PNP) chemistry, plant metabolic engineering, plant enzymology, systems biology and computational biology, and chemistry to define and develop rational design strategies to produce known and novel PNP of pharmaceutical and industrial interest in a sustainable, economical, and ecological way. A tremendous amount of knowledge has been gained during the last decades about the biosynthetic capacity of plants and the pathways leading to the formation of plant natural products (PNPs), many of which are of high relevance as pharmaceuticals or fine chemicals for industries. To fully exploit the capacity of engineering plants for the production of high value PNPs this Action  will support and enhance a pan-European network which will amalgamate resources, define target pathways and prioritize compounds, disseminate novel technologies and applications, set standards for computational support, and develop synthetic approaches in plant metabolic engineering. Outcomes will help guiding researchers in the design of plants as production host and provide building blocks for pathway engineering.
