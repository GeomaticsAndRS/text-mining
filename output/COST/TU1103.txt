  The Light Rail Transit (LRT) is spread in many countries all over the world, and particularly in Europe. Some historical networks have a very long experience and others are (re)discovering LRTs with a high disparity in terms of institutional and economical contexts, safety management, operational monitoring and technical choices. In this context, the Action  aims at improving LRT safety and reducing the impact of their conflicts with other public space users. This can be achieved by sharing European experiences on LRTs' accidents and their interaction with public space, practices and operating methods, taking into account the different cultural and historical contexts. Through exchanges with other LRT specialists on available data and results, analysis and comparisons on accident and incident data, the Action  will allow to give the greatest safety benefits for best costs. This Action  is built on a bottom-up approach in order to give practical results and solutions to operators and authorities. Beyond internal exchanges, communication and dissemination of outcomes by various means (guidelines, recommendations, website ) will allow to reach most concerned actors at the EU level. It will also encourage a common approach and possible transpositions of some good practices in a context of internationalisation.
