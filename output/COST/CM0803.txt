  The main objective of the Action  is to develop peptidomimetic foldamers into a technology platform in drug discovery and biomedical applications. The goal is to relay the ideas, pharmacophore models and requirements among the potential biomedical applications (e.g., inhibition of protein-protein interactions, self-assembling nanostructured drug delivery systems, functional biomimetic materials, etc.), to the laboratories involved in foldamer design and synthesis, and the researchers who are continuously extending the pool of homologated amino acidss. This parallel top-down and bottom-up information handling is expected to boost the application oriented foldamer research in Europe.
