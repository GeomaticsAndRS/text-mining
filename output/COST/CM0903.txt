  The main objective of the Action  is to generate a synergistic approach for utilisation of biomass for sustainable fuels  chemicals through cooperation between scientists from different member states and different areas and disciplines. This Action  is aimed at coordinating scientific innovations within Europe in order to improve existing methods or develop new ones for utilisation of biomass to produce biofuels, platform and specialty chemicals in accordance with the safety and environmental requirements. Special emphasis will be placed on the utilisation of lignocellulose biomass, algae and non-edible crops, which does not compete with food. It will involve the use of green catalytic methodologies (homogeneous, heterogeneous, enzymatic and photocatalysis) and novel reaction media. Moreover, alternative biomass-based products that are safer and have a reduced environmental footprint, (e.g. biodegradable polymers) will be explored. The Action  is also linked to extended biorefinery concepts in wood and pulp industry and to greener and more economic energy utilization between plants and communities. Successful results will be a result of the cooperation of both scientists and R D workers in universities, research institutes and in industry.
