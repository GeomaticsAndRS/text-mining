  The main objective of this Action  is to study chemical processes relevant to the physical conditions encountered in the interstellar medium, and on the surface and in the atmospheres of planetary bodies. The Action  aims to provide new insights into the dynamics of the chemical reactions leading to molecular synthesis under such conditions and reveal how these are influenced by the ambient temperature and pressure. Special attention will also be given to the study of the novel surface chemistry prevalent on interstellar medium dust grains and planetary surfaces. The Action  also aims to combine such laboratory data with complementary chemical models to allow a fuller interpretation of observational data.
