  There is an active research programme across Europe into the molecular mechanisms and mutations in AML (acute myeloid leukaemia) and MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) which is focused on high level technologies such as mRNA or miRNA expression profiling, genome-wide epigenetic or genotyping. They are aimed at understanding the molecular basis of these diseases, to develop technologies for improving diagnosis, prognosis and a move towards personalised therapeutic choices. This Action  will establish a wider European network to promote contacts and exchanges of experience and technology among laboratories involved in basic research and diagnostic services and promote the development of new resources and technological tools providing new insights into basic pathogenesis and improve clinical investigations. The European Genomic and Epigenetic Study on MDS and AML (EuGESMA) COST Action  would establish a permanent network among outstanding groups who actively contribute to the understanding and integration of modern genomics technologies with the aim of translating these into a clinical environment. Keywords: acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, translational research, technology integration.
