  Scientists are prompted to seek alternative methodologies for the production of materials, fuels and chemicals using low environmental impact technologies and greener methodologies with comparable efficiencies to those currently available in view of the expected resource scarcity and future oil economy. Lignocellulosic residues can constitute a highly promising (and currently largely under-utilised) feedstock with a significant potential to be converted into useful end products. However, a joint multidisciplinary effort from several disciplines including (bio)chemistry, biology, (bio)chemical and biological engineering, forest products sciences as well as environmental sciences and experts in economic assessment in liaison with industry is required to appropriately address the efficient transformation of such residues. The main objective of this Action  is to develop a solid European multidisciplinary network able to provide a range of innovative alternatives to the valorisation of lignocellulosic residues to chemicals, fuels and materials making use of environmentally sound protocols from pretreatment/fractionation to conversion to valuable end products. Thus, this Action  will bridge gaps between academic disciplines as well as between academia and industry by bringing together skills and expertise that cross scientific borders interconnecting different technology hubs across Europe, overcoming technological barriers, going beyond current lignocellulosic waste exploitation/management approaches.
