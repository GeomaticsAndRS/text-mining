  This proposal will coordinate Brewer Spectrophotometer measurements of ozone, spectral UV and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the UV within Europe, and unite the ozone, UV and AOD communities, through a formally managed European Brewer Network capable of delivering a consistent, spatially homogeneous European data resource, significant for the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the World Ozone and UV Data Centre (WOUDC), the International Ozone Commission (IO3C), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) and the ozone trend assessment panels. Around 50 Brewer Spectrophotometers are deployed in Europe, independently funded by national agencies, each duplicating effort to achieve separately best practice and accuracy. A COST Action  is the ideal mechanism to remove this disparity, establish knowledge exchange and training, and open up a route to links with international agencies and other networks globally.
