  Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) have a significant potential in the development of ITS and mobility services, expected to deliver many benefits including reducing congestion, increasing capacity and improving safety. The road sector is estimated to represent more than 50% of the GNSS market and 75% when we consider the mobility services on smartphones. However, the current lack of a pan-European certification process underpinned by agreed standards is impeding the realisation of the expected benefits. The main reason for this is the complexity of defining and assessing GNSS performance which is highly influenced by the environment and operational scenario. Although standardisation activities have been initiated in Europe on this topic, many scientific issues are still open and require a common agreement. This Action  brings together experts in GNSS, ITS and mobility to address the open issues and guarantee the success of the standardisation for underpinning certification initiatives. The Action  will provide 4 deliverables and will propose a unified framework for definition and assessment of performance for the GNSS-based positioning terminals. This framework is expected to pave the way for certified terminals, which is expected to result in a significantly accelerated use of GNSS-based ITS and mobility applications.
