  Guanosine is one of the DNA nucleotides and together with its derivatives it has a high potential for self-recognition and self-assembly, as well as the recognition ability for other biologically important molecules. These properties will be explored in detail with the goal to increase the knowledge on basic principles of guanosine-assembly, to synthesize new optimized materials, and to explore their electronic and optical properties. Novel reproducible and well ordered supramolecular structures will be designed to serve as molecular-scale architectures for new hybrid molecular electronics. The key innovation is in merging the biorecognition properties of guanosine-based materials with their promising electronic properties, which opens up a wide range of possible biomedical applications. Keywords: G-quartet, quadruplex DNA and RNA, molecular electronics, biomaterials, nanotechnology.
