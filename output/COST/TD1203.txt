  Food supply chain waste (FSCW) creates huge environmental, economic and social problems. There is now a growing recognition that the twin problems of waste management and resource depletion can be solved together through the utilisation of waste as a resource, using green and sustainable technologies. The EUBis Action  represents a timely opportunity to develop novel strategies for the valorisation of FSCW to new, sustainable and functional feedstocks. The symbiotic organisation of a COST Action  will greatly benefit EU research in this field, and will focus on key areas to provide cohesive direction on the valorisation of FSCW within a multidisciplinary and multinational collaborative network. The overall aim of EUBis is to bring about a critical mass of researchers and stakeholders to harness the potential of FSCW as an alternative carbon source to produce commercially viable chemical commodities.  The EUBis Action  will bring together skills and expertise that cross scientific borders, covering biology, chemistry, biotechnology and food science and technology as well as experts in environmental and economic assessment. EUBis will interconnect different technology hubs across Europe, overcome technological barriers, go beyond current waste exploitation/management approaches, and bridge gaps between academic disciplines as well as between academia and industry.
