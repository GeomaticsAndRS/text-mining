  The main objective of the Action  is the development and dissemination of knowledge and tools to assess and promote the refurbishment of existing suburban building stocks. Suburban building estates make up more than 50% of all European Urban Heritage. Most of the buildings � generally multi-family housing blocks consisting of small apartments � were completed after 1950 using low-cost technologies and are often characterized by very poor quality, which contributes to the social decay of suburbs. The aim of the Action  is to investigate, compare, define and disseminate common knowledge concerning methods, procedures and technologies for: - the renovation and revitalization of suburban housing settlements, - increasing their value, and - improving safety and the quality of life of inhabitants. The approach is based on a concept of Quality which incorporates a multitude of factors including energy efficiency, accessibility, sustainability and multi-functionality of buildings. On the other hand, quality standards must be improved in order to satisfy user needs as regards comfort, safety and accessibility, as well as the new European regulations concerning sustainability and energy savings. In order to achieve these objectives, new specific social, financial, technical and procedural models must be developed to facilitate the decisions of local authorities, housing corporations, owners and designers. A relevant number of representative case studies from the countries involved in the Action  will be analyzed to test and validate the results achieved.
