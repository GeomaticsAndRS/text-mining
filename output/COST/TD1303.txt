  Arthropod vectors and vector-borne diseases are frequently zoonotic infections and although their most significant clinical effects are often on the human population, the main infection sources are dependent on vectors, animal reservoirs and environmental factors. Hence, their surveillance and control require efficient and appropriately standardised methods, integrated knowledge and awareness among researchers, academic educators and policy-makers as well as well-trained young scientists. EurNegVec aims to promote all of these values and apply them in the field of vectors (ticks, mosquitoes, sandflies, midges and fleas) and vector-borne pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa and nematodes). The main objectives are to endorse exchange of knowledge and methodologies, improve higher education, facilitate training of next generation experts, improve the European and national policies, produce innovation and disseminate the related scientific information, all these under the framework of the One Health paradigm.
