  With the rapidly growing international trade in plants and ongoing impacts of climate change, activities of plant pathogens in the genus Phytophthora are increasing, threatening the biodiversity and sustainability of European forest ecosystems. This Action  unites scientists and disease control experts working on Phytophthora in forest ecosystems with the overall aim of increasing understanding of the biology and ecology of Phytophthora species with potential to cause damage to European forestry; this knowledge will be used in the development of effective control and management protocols for the problems caused. This knowledge will be promoted in an effort to increase knowledge and awareness of the problem by disseminating information to end-users and authorities in the forestry sector, and to the general public. In four interrelated working groups the ways in which Phytophthora species spread into and within Europe; examine methods to detect host resistance; disseminate state-of-the art rapid molecular diagnostics, and seek sustainable techniques for management and control of the diseases. Project  outcomes will include understanding of threats to forest ecosystems by Phytophthora, increased abilities rapidly to detect the pathogens, and sustainable management solutions to the diseases caused by these destructive organisms.
