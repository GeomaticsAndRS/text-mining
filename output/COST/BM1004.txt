  A wide number of scientific methodologies and disciplines are relevant to the study of early autism, including studying genetically at risk  siblings; the development of novel neuroimaging techniques; and developing and testing screening instruments and interventions. The lack of a forum to enhance the scientific synergies between these strands of basic and applied research has hindered progress. This Action  will create a network to enable developments in clinical practice and policy to be informed by cutting edge science and a rigorous evidence-base, significantly improving quality of life for individuals with autism, their families and broader European society. Increased and earlier recognition has impacted across Europe in terms of demand for diagnostic services and interventions. Current health care systems across Europe are very variable in terms of their expertise and capacity to support families with young children with autism, often leading to marginalisation.
