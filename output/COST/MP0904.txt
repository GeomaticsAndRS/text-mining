  The main objective of this Action  is to organize a multidisciplinary European scientific network of groups experienced in synthesis, advanced characterization and modeling of single-and multi-phase ferroic and multiferroic nanosystems. The goal of the Action  is to build a high level European scientific knowledge platform in the field of single and multiphase nanoscale ferroic and multiferroic oxides with restricted geometries, in which new properties are driven by engineering size, shape and interface-mediated phenomena. Ferroic and multiferroic oxides with various boundary conditions (thin films, free-standing, supported nano-particles/wires/ribbons/islands/toroids, hollow particles, hierarchical structures) and multiphase systems with at least one ferroic or multiferroic component will be produced by innovative synthesis and a top-down approach, investigated by manifold complex tools and theoretically described by multiscale modeling. Active links among European laboratories will be established to increase knowledge beyond the state-of-the art in this research field. Specific tools will be promoted to create a young researchers group with high scientific level and managerial competence, to contribute to the future competitiveness of Europe in this research topic.
