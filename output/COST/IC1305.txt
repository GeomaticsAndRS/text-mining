  Ultrascale systems are envisioned as large-scale complex systems joining parallel and distributed computing systems that will be two to three orders of magnitude larger that today's systems. The EU is already funding large scale computing systems research, but it is not coordinated across researchers, leading to duplications and inefficiencies. The goal of the NESUS Action  is to establish an open European research network targeting sustainable solutions for ultrascale computing aiming at cross fertilization among HPC, large scale distributed systems, and big data management. The network will contribute to glue disparate researchers working across different areas and provide a meeting ground for researchers in these separate areas to exchange ideas, to identify synergies, and to pursue common activities in research topics such as sustainable software solutions (applications and system software stack), data management, energy efficiency, and resilience. Some of the most active research groups of the world in this area are members of this proposal. This Action  will increase the value of these groups at the European-level by reducing duplication of efforts and providing a more holistic view to all researchers, it will promote the leadership of Europe, and it will increase their impact on science, economy, and society.
