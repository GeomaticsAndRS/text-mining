  Random network coding emerged through an award-winning paper by R. Koetter and F. Kschischang in 2008 and has since then opened a major research area in communication technology with widespread applications for communication networks like the internet, wireless communication systems, and cloud computing. It allows transmitting information through a network by disregarding any of its topological features. As in traditional algebraic coding theory, two main research directions in random network coding are existence and construction of good and optimal network codes, efficient encoding and decoding schemes for a given network code. Restriction to the so-called Grassmannian codes has proven to be advantageous and leads to the theory of designs over GF(q). Worldwide, there exists a larger number of workgroups focusing on this topic, which includes several groups located in Europe. This COST Action  will set up a European research network and establish network coding as a European core area in communication technology. Its aim is to bring together experts from pure and applied mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering, who are working in the areas of discrete mathematics, coding theory, information theory, and related fields.
