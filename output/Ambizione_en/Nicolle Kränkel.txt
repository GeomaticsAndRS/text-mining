Lead Lay summary Cells of the blood and in contact with blood can release small vesicles. Those are like sprouts of the ?mother cell?, being surrounded by a membrane and filled with fluid and proteins like the mother cell. Those vesicles are not ?alive? as a cell, but can serve as a messenger, carrying molecules from the mother cell to other cells. Our project focuses on specific molecules within the vesicles in the blood, called micro-RNA. Those are particularly short molecules of the same sort as out genetic material, the DNA. It has been found that microRNAs cannot serve as a template for protein, as our DNA, but they can impair the manufacture of other proteins. Other researchers have found that microRNA can be carried by microvesicles from one cell to another and thereby can alter the proteins in the receiving cell. This will result in altered behaviour of the receiving cell and has been implicated in various diseases, such as tumor growth. In our project we investigate what distinguishes microvesicles from patients with vascular disease from microvesicles of healthy blood donors, especially which microRNAs are different, and we want to find out whether these differences are involved in the cardiovascular disease process. In the end, we would like to understand whether we can modify microvesicles and the microRNA carried by them in a way to positively affect the blood vessel function in patients with vascular disease.
