Lead viral hepatitis are among the most important causes of mortality among the population infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this, little d? study evaluated l? impact of HIV on the complications related to infection by viruses from l? hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV). This project aims to better understand l? epidemiology, virology and clinical consequences of viral hepatitis in Africa. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work L? main objective of the project is d? analyse the prevalence of viral hepatitis in different regions d?Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as to determine their main epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics. L? evaluation of the response to the treatment of? hepatitis B several years of follow-up will also be one of the major elements of this study. The project s? based on the network of cohort Ìèðêà, a collaboration in the field of HIV established for several years in sub-Saharan Africa. In this context, we have implemented several cohorts dedicated to l? study of hepatitis viral B and C in Zambia, Mozambique, as well as in several countries?Africa?West. Virological analyses detailed as well as l? evaluation of hepatic fibrosis will be carried out in addition to routine analyses. The results will be compared with those of the cohort HIV Switzerland, which enable us to highlight the fundamental epidemiological differences between these two regions. Scientific and social context of the research project viral hepatitis are a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. This project will address the most important issues related to this topic and d? help in implementing prevention and treatment strategies in this region. Knowledge transfer will be an important part of this project, including doctors and local virologists in the collection and l? data analysis.
