Lead in this project, we investigate how genes and development processes affect certain characteristics of plants, and how different environmental conditions can change the characteristics and evolution of these traits. We focus on two features relating to the relationships between individuals, namely those between mother plants and their offspring, and that if they become on the mother plant seeds, between mature plants in a plant community. Lay summary background: the study of ecologically relevant properties of plants promotes our understanding of evolutionary processes on the one hand, but also ways to yield gains in agriculture. In this project we want to combine methods from genetics and ecology, and to answer the following questions: what are the development of genetic basics of mother-child or plant plant interactions? Do these interactions affect the fitness of plants? What happens when these interactions are modified? The aim of the project is to gain a mechanistic understanding of the ecological function of two types of relationships between plant individuals. On the one hand, we ask how a mother plant can control their decimal numbers and optimally distribute their resources to the individual offspring. On the other hand, would we understand as individuals in a simple plant community interact with each other and how such interactions can lead to so-called Diversit√§tseffekten, which go beyond the sum of the capacities of single individuals. The question of?How? We want that?Why?Facing the question, i.e. we want to find out how changes in development processes affect the individual or the community and return these effects on evolutionary processes. Meaning: The project conclude a still existing gap between developmental genetics and ecology. This, we hope to deepen our understanding of genetic development processes through the study of environmental influences, which affect the evolution of these processes.
