Lead Lay summary In this project we study strongly correlated photons in coupled cavity/waveguide QED architectures. We consider two different aspects: (i) mesoscopic photon transport and (ii) phase transitions and exotic states of light. In the first part we investigate the scattering of photons in resonators and waveguides at experimentally controllable impurities, e.g., atoms, quantum dots, or Kerr materials. We intent to develop efficient building blocks for quantum networks with applications in quantum information science (quantum computing). In the second part we investigate many-body states of photonic quasiparticles, e.g., cavity-polaritons and Kondo-excitons. Our major focus is on the question how to engineer exotic, strongly correlated and collective states of light through targeted interaction with bosonic or fermionic reservoirs (reservoir engineering). The aim in both projects is to develop new methods, that enable us to investigate the effect of pump and decoherence on strongly correlated scattering and many-body states of light.
