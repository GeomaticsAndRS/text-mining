Lead fuel cells are devices that convert the chemical energy of reactants, such as hydrogen and oxygen into electricity with good performance and without the emission of harmful substances. As a result, great interest was directed to the production of hydrogen using electrolytic cells. Electrolytic cells can be described as fuel cells where the main reaction takes place in the opposite direction, consuming energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Lay summary and more that objective? restricts the performance of electrolytic cells and fuel is the electrode in which reactions take place of electrocatalysis of oxygen. The development of an economic material, electrode stabilie in time, and with good performance could therefore promote rapid commercialization of such devices. Nature perovskitica oxide materials possess good potential? as electrodes. For this reason, this project aims to investigate such materials, developing a comprehensive knowledge of their catalytic properties. The main innovation of this project compared to state of the art consists in the study of the property? These surface materials. Â  Socio-scientific context After the decision to end the use of nuclear power stations in Switzerland, great attention was paid to the use of renewable energy sources. The renewable energy is? produced in discontinuously and need storage systems. Using an electrolytic cell the electricity produced from renewable energy sources can? be stored using hydrogen and oxygen, which can then be reused to generate energy when and where it is needed through a fuel cell.
