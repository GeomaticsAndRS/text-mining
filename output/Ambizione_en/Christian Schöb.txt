Lead the niche theory is a central concept of ecology, that describes when and why species can exist together. Whereas in accordance with the current niche theory, coexistence but primarily is a function of the avoidance of negative interactions between organisms, recent findings point to the importance of positive interactions. Nevertheless, positive interactions can enjoy a shadowy existence, particularly in the Central theories of biodiversity. Lay summary objective of my research is to examine, in particular its implications for the coexistence and evolution of individuals and types of the underlying mechanisms of positive interactions between plants. In the detail I (1) will the consequences of positive interactions for the biodiversity of ecosystems quantify the niche theory, (2) whose presence and intensity in different ecosystems (from high alpine to agricultural, of humid temperate and dry Mediterranean) compare and identify (3) the potential consequences for the evolution of populations and species. This work will allow me to draw attention to the ubiquity of positive interactions and to determine the importance of the coexistence of individuals and species under different environmental conditions. The findings will give us the opportunity to integrate positive interactions in Central theories of biodiversity (E.g., the niche theory). In addition, we hope to gain important insights for a sustainable development and agriculture related of biodiversity in accordance with the receipt. Â
