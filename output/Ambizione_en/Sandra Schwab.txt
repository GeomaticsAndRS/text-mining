Lead when francophones speak in a foreign language such as German, English or Spanish, they usually present problems at the level of the pronunciation of sounds, but also, or even mostly, at the level of the accent of words (for example, in German, the first syllable should be stressed in the word EINladung, invitation, while the second syllable should be stressed in the word VerZEIhung)(, forgiveness). The difficulties of francophones to collect or to discriminate accentual contrasts that do not exist in their native language (for example between the Spanish words VAlido, valid and vaLIdo, I validate) has led researchers to characterize focus deaf francophones. Lay summary contents and objectives of the work of research starting from the idea that francophones are deaf to emphasis, our main objective is to determine if the francophones are able to learn to perceive accentual contrasts that do not exist in their native language. First, we will examine if Francophone listeners, without knowledge of Spanish, are able, after a several-month training period, collect accentual contrasts in Spanish. In addition, we will compare their performance with that of German-speaking and Spanish-speaking, auditors to assess the role of mother tongue in accentual contrasts in second language learning. Second, we will determine if the natural environment of the language classroom just to accentual contrasts learning or training specifically on accentual contrasts is required. Scientific and social context of the research project this research fits within a multidisciplinary framework, since it affects both phonetic and experimental Psycholinguistics and the neurolinguistic. Furthermore, our conclusions, in addition to the implications they will have for basic research in psycholinguistics, will have direct benefits for the teaching of foreign languages, especially for teaching pronunciation, where awareness of accentual contrasts, often contributing to the intelligibility of a statement, is generally lacking.
