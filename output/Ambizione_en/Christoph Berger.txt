Lead attacks the immune system called the body of Autoimmunity. It is unclear what causes Autoimmunity exactly. We postulate that allow a dysregulierte release of neurotransmitters and/or the failure of regulatory cells in Autoimmunity. Missing regulation could have a proliferation of immune cells result which components of your body recognize and attack. What such auto reactive cells is unknown in the most autoimmune diseases. Lay summary content and the aim of the research project the overall objective of the project is to contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Autoimmunity.  We plan to investigate what people on an autoimmune disease of the blood vessels? the so called Riesenzellarteritis? suffer.  Specifically, we would like to define as (i) immunological cytokines? so-called cytokines? promote the proliferation of immune cells that attack the body; (ii) what strukture(en) exactly identify the misdirected immune cells; and (iii) whether regulating immune cells,? which auto-immunity should prevent? could be defective.  Modern laboratory methods and computerized data analysis will be in the application. Scientific and social context of the research project our project will provide information about the processes that favour the development of autoimmune diseases.  If we succeed in precisely to define the dysregulierten immune cells, so this is the basis to develop tests that could be applied in the diagnosis or monitoring of therapy of patients.
