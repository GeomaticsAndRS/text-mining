Lead the main objective of IMPORED is to study the interaction between two of the most important respiratory pathogens for l? human, the virus of influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae and characterize the immune response of the host to this co-infection. Using molecular tools, we will try to describe a model to predict when flu virus infection can progress to an infection secondary pneumocale dangerous. Lay summary respiratory infections are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Among the major pathogens of the respiratory tract, virus influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus) have an impact on health and are responsible for billions of public money lost each year. D? generally, scientific studies have focused on?a single pathogen infections. However, it has been shown that, in some cases, co-infection with a particular combination of pathogens result in a more severe clinical symptom compared only pathogen infection. However, the mechanisms by which influenza virus can facilitate secondary pneumococcal infections remain unclear. This project concerns the study of host-pathogen interactions during co-infection involving the virus of the flu and s. pneumoniae, using molecular techniques (analysis of microbiome, microarray analysis) and methods of microscopy tip (intravital 2-photon microscopy) in a Murine model. We use well-known co-infection of virus influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae to analyze their interactions with commensal bacteria and study the response of the host. As a second objective, we will examine in vivo effects than the molecular mechanisms, identified in the previous goal, have on the development of a secondary pneumococcal infection.
