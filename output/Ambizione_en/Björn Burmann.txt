Lead the transcription, translation of DNA, mRNA, is catalyzed by an RNA polymerase in all organisms. The various stages of transcription initiation, elongation and termination, are strictly regulated. An important regulator protein in E. coli bacteria is the Rho protein. Rho is a hexameres protein, which due to its choice function guarantees that Operongrenzen and adapts to the conditions of growth of bacteria transcription level. Lay summary although the shaped Rho protein as an essential Terminationsfaktor was identified more than 50 years ago, the details of his role have not been resolved up until today. In particular its dynamism and the mechano-chemical principles of its function are poorly understood. To answer these questions, the high-resolution methyl Kernresonanrspektroskopie, which enables the analysis of large proteins and protein complexes in aqueous solution, is ideal. By means of this experimental method as a priority the following aspects should be examined: (1) characterizing the structure and dynamic of Rho in the substrate-free form. (2) structural and functional characterization of the interaction of Rho with his rut detection-RNA. (3) structural and functional characterization of the interaction between Rho and its co-factor NusG. The aim is to enlighten the individual partial functions of the Rhoproteins at the atomic level and to derive any generally applicable principles of operation for other systems.
