Lead in text, the s phrases? linked together in a coherent manner. These links of consistency can be explained by l? use of words as? but? and? because?, which we call a? pragmatic connectors? Studies have shown that the problems of coherence in a text are often linked to a bad use of these words. L? reverse, when the pragmatic connectors are correctly used, they improve the speed of reading, and understanding and the memory d? a text. Lay summary master l? use of pragmatic connectors is essential to clearly articulate his ideas, but also particularly complex. Some works show that until? ten years, children n? not adequately utilize simple connectors marking temporal or causal relationships. From a multilingual perspective, pragmatic connectors is still more problematic, because the languages vary considerably in l? use qu? they make and few exact matches exist even between close languages. The MULDIS project has three objectives: (1) study systematically the correspondences between the pragmatic connectors of the french, German and l? English to precisely map areas of divergence; (2) study l? acquisition of typical connectors of the language written in German and french in children aged 8 to 16 years old; (3) study l? connectors English second language learning and compare the difficulties of French-speaking and German-speaking learners. These three domains d? complementary study will allow d? improve our understanding of the functioning of the connectors in languages as well as their representation in the mental lexicon of speakers, with significant benefits for the first and second language pedagogy and lexicography. This project is part of the scientific centre of expertise on plurilingualism.
