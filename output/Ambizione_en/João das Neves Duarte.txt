Lead L? insulin controls the metabolism of the brain and neurotransmission. Resistance to l? insulin affects the structure and function of the brain and leads to the deterioration of memory. Through this study, we check the correlation between metabolic changes and the deterioration of the structure of the brain and the decline in memory. Lay summary L? insulin controls the metabolism of the brain and neurotransmission. In the case of the type 2 diabetes, resistance to l? insulin affects the structure and function of the brain and leads to deterioration of memory, as in the case of d disease?Alzheimer's disease (ad). Indeed, it has been reported that the MA is associated with either a reduction of signaling by l? insulin, is an alteration of the transport and metabolism of glucose to the brain. This project, developed on a model of l-resistant rats? insulin, objective primary seek changes in energy metabolism of the brain, and this in a non-invasive manner by magnetic resonance methods nuclear. Through this study, we also want to verify the correlation between metabolic changes and the deterioration of the structure of the brain, thus qu? between biomarkers of the MA and the decline of memory. Furthermore, neuroprotective strategies will be tested to prevent or stop these alterations of the brain in subjects with resistance to l? insulin. In particular, we will evaluate the role neuroprotective of regular consumption of caffeine that was inversely correlated to the risk of cognitive impairment and my. The results of this study have highlighted in a non-invasive way biomarkers useful for early diagnosis of the My. Moreover, these markers open up prospects for the development of clinical therapeutic strategies to reduce the number of diabetic patients who develop encephalopathy, cognitive impairment and MA.
