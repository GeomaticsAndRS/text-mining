Lead Lay summary The cell biology of intracellular pathogens (viruses, bacteria, eukaryotic parasites) has provided us with molecular information of host?pathogen interactions. As a result it is becoming increasingly evident that lipids play important roles at various stages of this intricate interaction between the pathogens and their hosts. Being positioned at the cell surface, lipids contribute to the interplay between host and pathogen, acting in first line recognition and host cell signaling during pathogen docking, invasion and intracellular trafficking. Serving as a basic building block of membranes and as an energy source, lipids are critical for the growth and replication of a pathogen. Despite the growing appreciation of the relevance of lipids in infectious diseases, many gaps remain to be filled. Combining novel lipidomics approaches with synthetic chemistry, infection biology and molecular epidemiology, we aim to link changes in macrophage lipid metabolism, membrane trafficking and immunomodulation to  defined pathogens including Mycobacterium spp. , as well as microbial lipids. An in vitro cellular system using the human macrophage will be complemented with in vivo models of infection as well as clinical and/or field research to establish the functional roles of lipids in mycobacteriosis and parasitic infection.
