Lead food allergy, caused by an uncontrolled immune response against normally harmless components of the food, represent a growing global health problem. A number of studies has shown that a Western lifestyle, associated with an increased risk of allergy, has a critical effect on the composition of our intestinal flora (microbiota), which is in turn essential for the optimal development of our immune system. The project examines the role of microbiota in the context of experimentally induced food allergies. Lay summary objectives of the research project at the beginning of the research and the results after completion of the project: In this study we examine what influence the intestinal flora exerts on the development of a food allergy. In addition, we will examine whether a change in the composition represents a pure consequence to the intestinal flora after induction of food allergy or is the cause of an allergic reaction. We are confident that our results will make an important contribution to the understanding of the role of the microbiota in the development of allergies.   Scientific and social context of the research project: the diagnosis of allergies has doubled in the last 20 years. The exact causes for this increased risk of allergy are largely unknown. Existing therapies to combat only the symptoms of an allergic reaction, but not the cause. It is therefore important to develop new therapeutic approaches, which already nip in the bud the emergence of an allergic reaction. Our aim is therefore new concepts to the causes of allergic reactions to explore.
