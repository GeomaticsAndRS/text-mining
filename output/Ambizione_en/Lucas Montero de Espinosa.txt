Lead unlike traditional polymers resulting from l? association d? monomeric units by covalent bonds, supramolecular polymers are composed of monomers that interact Covalent and reversible manner. L? interests of these polymers is in their dynamic nature, which allows to control their structure/composition by acting on the external conditions such as temperature, pH, or l? UV irradiation. However, despite their promising potential, supramolecular polymers are still far from becoming marketable products, and this mainly because of the complexity of their summaries. Lay summary content and objective of the work of research L? main objective of this project is d? explore the potential of binding d? hydrogen between l? isophthalic acid and pyridine, and l? use as supramolecular motif for the synthesis of polymers with good mechanical properties. This project is divided into two parts. The first s? interested in understanding of the molecular and structural parameters that control the macroscopic properties of these polymers. Then, the second will use this knowledge to develop two components formed supramolecular resins, which have properties similar to traditional thermostable polymers such as epoxy resins. These new resins present l? advantage to be processed many times. Therefore, the recycling of their components as well as d? any additives, such as carbon fiber, will be easier. Scientific and social context of the research project the aim of this work is to better understand the effects of segregation phases in supramolecular polymers formed by d-link? hydrogen. This would provide solutions to problems d? industrial and social interests such as the recycling of composite materials containing thermostable resins. Keywords supramolecular polymers, binding d? hydrogen, resins in two-components, segregation of phases, mechanical properties, polyacrylates, vegetable oils, polymer telequeliques.
