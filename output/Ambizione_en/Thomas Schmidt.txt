Lead Lay summary Nanomechanical and optomechanical systems have attracted much attention among experimental and theoretical physicists in the past years. Advances in lithographic techniques have made it possible to manufacture nanomechanical resonators (NRs) with lateral dimensions of a few nanometers and lengths of a few microns, and to integrate them into experimental setups to measure their dynamical properties. The interest in these systems is mainly owed to two aspects: first, it has been realized that NRs react very sensitively to external forces. Since their properties can be read out very accurately using electronic or optical methods, this facilitates the design of ultrasensitive measurement devices for, e.g., charge, mass and force. A second, more fundamental, incentive to study nanomechanical systems stems from the fact that due to their sizes, they operate at the boundary between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. In the past years, there have been experimental attempts to look for signatures of quantum physics in these systems, and experiments are approaching the required accuracy. So far, however, a direct detection of a quantum state in a macroscopic system like an NR has been elusive. In this project, I would like to theoretically investigate possible nanomechanical setups in which it is possible to observe quantum mechanical properties of mechanical resonators, and find systems which allow a level of control over nanomechanical systems which could enable the generation of true quantum states, e.g. superpositions or entangled states.
