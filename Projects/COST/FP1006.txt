  Many applications of products are determined by their special surface properties, and based on the physical, chemical and biological interchange of various molecules with the materials surface. This is especially true for the use of wood and wood based products due to the special wood characteristics like anisotropy, UV-degradation. Thus, bringing new functions to wood through surface modification is needed in order to enhance the quality of the existing wood products and to open the way to new applications, products or markets. This COST Action  aims to provide the scientific-based framework and knowledge required for enhanced surface modification of wood and wood based products towards higher functionalization and towards fulfillment of higher technical, economic and environmental standards. This will be achieved by working within three main areas: Wood surface modification and functionalization, Wood interface modification and interface interaction and Process and Service life modelling.
