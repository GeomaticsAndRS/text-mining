  Sonic Interaction Design is the exploitation of sound as one of the principal channels conveying information, meaning, and aesthetic/emotional qualities in interactive contexts. The Action  pro-actively contributes to the creation and consolidation of new design theories, tools, and practices in this innovative and interdisciplinary domain. While being advanced through a few sparse projects, this field relies on the COST SID Action  to strengthen the links between scientists, artists, and designers in the European Research Area. The COST  SID platform stands on four legs: (i) perception, cognition, and emotion; (ii) design; (iii) interactive art; (iv) information display and exploration. These are each supported by the research and development of the requisite new interactive technologies. Due to the breadth of its application spectrum, the COST SID Action  has the potential of affecting everyday life through physical and virtual interactive objects, as today there is the possibility to design and actively control their acoustic response so that it conveys an intended aesthetic, informational, or emotional content.
