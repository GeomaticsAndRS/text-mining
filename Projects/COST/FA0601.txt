  Most of the European marine fish resources are overexploited. Despite the technical measures implemented, many depleted stocks have failed to recover. There is increasing awareness that the traditional indicators of stock viability are inadequate because the capacity of the population to annually produce viable eggs and larvae is extremely important for stock viability and recovery. In addition, egg production is also influenced by ambient environmental conditions, the exact effects of which are still not quantified. Currently there are a number of research projects specifically examining the linkages between fish reproductive success and the subsequent population dynamics. In addition to these projects there is a need for increased cooperation between researchers, standardisation and cross calibration of the different protocols being used, enhanced exchange of ideas, demonstration of the latest advances and the creation of a common research platform that can provide fisheries managers with realistic tools for fish stock recovery.  The main objective of the Action  is to establish a network of researchers to co-operate on the improvement of knowledge on fish reproduction in relation to fisheries and the enhancement of the current assessment methodology in order to promote sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources.
