  The main objective of this Action  is to gain new understanding relating to the mode of action of biological adhesives so as to facilitate the development of synthetic counterparts with improved function. These bio-inspired adhesives will provide more elegant solutions to contemporary engineering and biomedical adhesive requirements and will additionally provide a platform for future technological innovation that requires adhesion in hostile conditions as a prerequisite. Biological adhesives often offer impressive performances and, therewith, the potential to inspire novel, superior industrial adhesives for an increasing variety of high-tech applications. Using an iterative, multidisciplinary biomimetic approach, structures, functions and principles of natural models can be experimentally studied, theoretically analyzed, and prototyped in order to bring innovative bio-inspired adhesives to the market. This COST Action  will unite widespread European expertise and activities in the fields of biological and technological adhesives (biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering), streamlining and pooling knowledge, methods and techniques, avoiding duplication of effort, decreasing costs, and accelerating scientific and technological progress in Europe.
