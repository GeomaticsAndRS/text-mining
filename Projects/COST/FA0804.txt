  Proof-of-principle for Molecular Farming (MF) has been established over the last 15 years through sustained efforts of a growing number of European research groups. This work has been supported by the strategic decision of the EU to fund several initiatives through FPs 4-6 resulting in an impressive volume of generated knowledge. The aim of the Action  is to leverage fruits of earlier EU, national and industrial investments in Molecular Farming to reach the next level, i.e. to move from R D to applications, to develop product-oriented platforms, to enable new classes of products, to lower the costs and ultimately to commercialize the products. This Action  will create new opportunities for European agriculture, horticulture and related technology sectors as the plants dedicated to Molecular Farming constitute new high-value crops. The Action  brings the key players together and will increase European momentum, capacity and infrastructure. It will also expand activities to countries that have not thus far been able to participate, including developing countries. The concrete outcome will be a sustainable European Molecular Farming community with a clear vision, and links and input into scientific, regulatory, biosafety, intellectual property (IP), dissemination and public engagement activities.
