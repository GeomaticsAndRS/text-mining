  Nanostructures show unique tunable material properties with major and proven potential for state-of-the-art optoelectronics. Exploiting them for the challenging implementation of next generation solar cell architectures requires novel multiscale modelling and characterization approaches which capture both the peculiar features at nanoscale and their impact on the optoelectronic performance at device levels. To foster progress towards such approaches, MULTISCALESOLAR creates a new network of experts defragmenting knowledge by combining existing research activities to address key issues in in next generation photovoltaics raised by academic and industrial end users. It provides quantum mechanical descriptions of electronic, optical and vibrational properties in order to parametrize mesoscopic models for the dynamics of charge carriers, photons and phonons in nanostructures. This yields effective material parameters for use in macroscopic device level models validated at each step by experiment. This Action  combines theoretical and experimental expertise in industry and academia benefitting the European Research Area. The Action  actively addresses gender issues, and favours early stage researchers, developing their scientific and management skills. The Action  yields, for the first time, validated multiscale understanding of nanostructure properties for optoelectronic applications, with a focus on third generation photovoltaics.
