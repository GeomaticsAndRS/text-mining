  Forensic psychiatric care is aimed at improving mental health and reducing the risk of recidivism of mentally disordered offenders. For some mentally disordered offenders (life-)long forensic psychiatric care is required. Due to different legal frameworks, policies and resources in COST countries, treatment programs and care provided for these offenders vary substantially within Europe. The proposed Action  aims at establishing a European network of researchers, clinicians and service providers about long-term forensic psychiatric care. The network is open for practitioners and experts from different disciplines and from different career stages. Researchers and clinicians will join their expertise and research activities to set the basis for comparative evaluation and research on effective treatment and the development of "best practice" in long-term forensic psychiatry in Europe. This will lead to the development of cost effective policies in forensic services, evidence-based practice in long-term forensic care and improvement of patients' quality of life.
