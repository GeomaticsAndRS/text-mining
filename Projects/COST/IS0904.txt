  This Action  aims to produce a broader understanding of the worldwide spread of European architecture across empires during the 19th and 20th c. by focusing on its vectors, connections, semantics and materiality in a large range of geographic and linguistic contexts engaging both Western and non-Western environments. It posits that the bilateral colonial channel (e.g. French architecture in Algeria or British architecture in India), represented but one aspect of a larger multifaceted history. By combining architectural history with area studies  knowledge, the intention is to map and analyze more complex dissemination patterns and border-crossing relationships. Beyond architecture, the challenge is to contribute to the writing of a global history of modern European culture, including overseas expansions and transnational dynamics in its scope. To that end, this Action  proposes joining efforts at the European level in collaboration with non-European researchers.  A major outcome will be the development of accurate digital resources on the topic, as a first step towards the building of a research infrastructure.
