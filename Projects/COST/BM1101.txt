  Dystonia syndromes (DS) are the third most common movement disorder, yet they are poorly understood and are underdiagnosed. The causes of these disabling neurological conditions are poorly known and the mechanisms that give rise to the uncontrollable involuntary movements have not been elucidated. Particularly the role played by genetic and environmental factors is unclear. Scientific initiatives are fragmented across Europe and hampered by insufficient dimension. This Action  will foster the creation of an interdisciplinary network of experts to promote genetic studies of DS, develop experimental animal models, standardise and harmonise patient care and educate the public and professionals about the disorder. It will create a unified platform for sharing expertise and exchanging procedures among centres in COST countries. Short-term scientific missions, training schools and workshops will be organised to train early-stage scientists with specific skills in the field of DS. Best practice guidelines will be set and national initiatives will be unified into a large-scale effort to improve knowledge of DS and increase standards of care for patients.
