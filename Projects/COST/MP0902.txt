  The main objective of the Action  is to develop new composite materials from inorganic nanotubes and polymers and to establish appropriate links and transfer of knowledge needed for application and commercialisation of this kind of composite media by European industry. Nanotubes made of inorganic materials are an interesting alternative to carbon nanotubes, showing advantages such as e.g. easy synthetic access, good uniformity and solubility, and predefined electrical conductivity depending on the composition of the starting material. They are therefore very promising candidates as fillers for polymer composites with enhanced thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. Target applications for this kind of composites are materials for heat management, electrostatic dissipaters, wear protection materials, photovoltaic elements, etc. The proposed Action  will link together European scientists working on this rapidly emerging field to create a basis for a highly interdisciplinary research network focused on development and exploration of inorganic nanotube-polymer composites. The Action  will generate a fundamental knowledge and create widespread links needed for application and commercialization of this kind of composite media by European industry.
