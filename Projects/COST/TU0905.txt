  The main objective of this Action  is to provide a strong contribution to the ongoing development of innovative high performance structural glass products mainly in architectural and solar applications, and to European standards in this field. The Action  will identify and share the outcomes of existing fragmented activities within the European research community. In addition, the Action  will establish a diverse multi-disciplinary network that will encourage new research and collaborations. Finally, the Action  will strengthen the current and future generations of European glass designers by developing a structural glass educational pack for university curricula across Europe. The STRUCTURAL GLASS Action  will result in high impact scientific and engineering advances. In addition, the STRUCTURAL GLASS Action  is expected to result in substantial benefits with respect to economics, well-being and the environment. More specifically, the Action  will strengthen Europe s leading position in the growing market of architectural glass manufacture, building fa ades and renewable energy applications by developing European design methods and novel high-performance products. This Action  will directly contribute to safer products and risk analysis-based design methods. In doing so, it will reduce glass-related injuries, which generally constitute an unacceptably high proportion of casualties in extreme loading events. Finally, the research themes supported by this COST Action  will directly lead to a reduction in embodied energy and will contribute to reducing energy demand in buildings.
