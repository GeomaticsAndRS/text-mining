  The focus of the COST Action  is the investigation of Pb-free replacements for high-Pb solders for high-temperature applications. This comprises a study of the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of alloys containing a large number of permutations of different alloying elements. A multiscale approach will be used: meso- scale: The application of thermodynamics and kinetics to the study of alloying behaviour; the development of materials property databases. macro- scale: The creation of a phenomenological description of corrosion and deformation processes occurring in a solder joint during fabrication and service, micro- (nano-)  scale: The investigation by experiment and modelling of the initial stage of the formation of intermetallic phases at the solder/substrate interface. This will involve the consideration of diffusion. This will be most efficiently achieved through coordinated international cooperation providing a basis for interdisciplinary research. The action will increase the basic understanding of alloys that can be used as Pb-free alternatives to high-temperature solders for practical applications, for example in the aerospace and automotive industries. Keywords:  High-temperature soldering, Pb-free solder alloys, multiscale modelling, materials properties, reliability.
