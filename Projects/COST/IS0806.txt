  The main objective of the Action  is to increase the material preconditions and the scholarly competence for analyzing variations in the effectiveness of electoral democracy in Europe across countries and over time. Preconditions will be strengthened by the identification, adaption and integration of the variety of national specific data bases on electoral behaviour. Theoretical and methodological capabilities will be improved by the provision of recurring training opportunities for young scholars as well as the organisation of regular scientific exchange of all scholars involved about the findings of the comparative analyses.
