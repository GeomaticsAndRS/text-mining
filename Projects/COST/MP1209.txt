  Modern technologies, that now miniaturise to the nanoscale and into the quantum regime, have the potential to revolutionise many upcoming socio-economic challenges. Historically, thermodynamics has been highly successful, enabling the development of technologies that changed our lives, ranging from fridges to jet planes. While these applications involve macroscopic systems, described accurately by the laws of classical physics, little is known about the applicability of standard notions of thermodynamics in the quantum regime.  The aim of the Action  is to establish and grow the scientific basis that underpins future thermodynamic technologies at the nanoscale. Central for this is the understanding of fundamental thermodynamic processes for small ensembles, particularly in the quantum regime, in- and out-of equilibrium. These are topics of the emerging cross-over field, quantum thermodynamics , which is overwhelmingly pioneered by researchers currently located in Europe, many at an early stage in their careers. However, this research across Europe is fragmented and needs large-scale coordination to path the way for swift progress. This Action  is designed to bring researchers from different backgrounds together, foster interdisciplinary exchange and coordinate domestically funded European research to create an internationally leading knowledge base in this emerging and technologically important field.
