  Social representations of history are vital to form a group s identity. They have a wide social and political impact as they provide some of the cultural contents that accompany identity changes following societal transformations. In Europe, these representations are fragmented between nations or ethnic groups. They elicit group-based emotions that influence behaviours and may lead to intergroup conflicts or reconciliation The aim of the COST Action  is to advance knowledge on the role played by social representations of history in processes of ethnic, national, and European identities construction and intergroup conflicts. It will coordinate research on 1) the psychological antecedents of lay representations of history; 2) their content and structure; 3) their transmission through history textbooks and other media; and 4) their social psychological effects in shaping attitudes. The Action  will stimulate scientific cooperation among social psychologists and historians sharing an interest for history education from a wide range of countries. This will be done through four Working groups, two international conferences, Short-Term Scientific Missions, a summer school and a dedicated website. The Action  will have an impact in both scientific and public domains through academic and public dissemination.
