  The main objective is to undertake a pan-European comparison and evaluation of methods for flood frequency estimation under the various climatologic and geographic conditions found in Europe, and different levels of data availability. This Action  undertakes a pan-European comparison and evaluation of different methods for flood frequency estimation under the various climatologic and geographic conditions found in Europe, and different levels of data availability. A scientific framework for assessing the ability of these methods to predict the impact of environmental change (climate change, land-use and river engineering works) on future flood frequency characteristics (flood occurrence and magnitude) will be developed and tested. The availability of such procedures is crucial for the formulation of robust flood risk management strategies as required by the Directive of the European Parliament on the assessment and management of floods. The outputs from FloodFreq will be disseminated to: academics, professionals involved in operational flood risk management from private and public institutions, and relevant policy makers from national and international regulatory bodies. This Action  enables cooperation between researchers involved in nationally funded research projects to, thereby enabling testing of methods free from the constraints of administrative boundaries, and allowing a more efficient use of European flood research funding.
