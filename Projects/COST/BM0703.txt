  The main objective of the Action  is to advance our knowledge on mechanisms that protect healthy cells from transforming into cancer cells. This Action  will provide an interaction platform for research focused on genomic integrity and epigenetics and their dysregulation in cancer. The Action  will combine expertise in the fields of DNA damage response, transcriptional control, chromatin organization, and cancer epigenetics, and explore the mechanisms underlying normal and deregulated functions. It will combine multidisciplinary expertise in biochemical, biological and functional genomics approaches and in exploiting animal models. The Action  will link experts in basic sciences with approaches in translational cancer research. Due to the highest clinical significance of understanding of the molecular basis of cancer progression, it will be of vital importance for the European researchers to develop strong points of interaction to provide them with a competitive edge, new research models and tools in cancer research. Keywords: DNA damage, repair, checkpoints, chromatin, transcription, translation, epigenetics, animal models
