  Optical Fibre Sensors offer a definitive solution to monitoring extreme parameters associated with security and safety applications. While the advantages of such sensors are well known, there are a number of identified technical problems yet to be resolved. By supporting collaboration of experts from multidisciplinary fields, to share their knowledge in sensor development and system design, together with developing characterisation and validation procedures, these problems can be addressed and so new generation optical fibre sensor systems can be realised awarding fundamentally stable and reliable sensors for enhancing public security and safety.
