  The main objective of the Action  is to make optimal use of new HIPP processes through a greater understanding of the physics of HIPP processes and the development of improved products by superior HIPP coatings. Enhanced properties such as increased hardness, density, refractive index, better adhesion, modified crystal structure, and much more can be realized, as shown by Academia and will be transferred to industry, since also industrial partners are involved. By joining knowledge and resources a new generation of deposition processes will be established with benefit for nearly all technical branches due to the cross sectional character of thin film technology.
