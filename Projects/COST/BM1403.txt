  The aim of this Action  is to nucleate a group of researchers with a common interest, namely developing and applying new biomolecular mass spectrometry (MS) methods in order to make the characterisation of protein structure and dynamcis more rapid and routine. Methods include non-denaturing MS approaches in combination with ion mobility, as well as hydrogen-deuterium exchange, chemical crosslinking and other labeling techniques together with computational approaches. This toolbox will be made available to the broader scientific community, and will greatly enhance our ability to design new drugs and ensure the quality and efficacy of biopharmaceuticals, thereby benefiting human health.
