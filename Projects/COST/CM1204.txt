  The use of novel light sources and fast ions is opening new avenues in the study of chemical reactivity. XUV/X-ray pulses with attosecond duration permit to "visualize" the movement of electrons inside a molecule and a much better control of chemical reactions. X-ray Free Electron Lasers, synchrotrons or collision with fast ions can be used to generate molecules in highly excited and highly charged states that present new and unexpected reactivity. The study of molecules under these extreme intensities and time resolution conditions requires new theoretical models that can serve as guidance for experiments. The scientific objective of the Action  is to understand, monitor and control the complex ultrafast electronic and nuclear dynamics that occur in medium-sized and large molecules, to develop new control strategies of reactions and to develop a new generation of ultrafast spectroscopies combining attosecond temporal and sub-Angstrom spatial resolutions. This is an interdisciplinary field in which European groups are very active but work separately. COST is thus the perfect framework to enhance exchange of knowledge, bringing together leading experts in generating, manipulating and modeling these new phenomena. The collaboration between groups will reinforce the European leadership in XUV/X-ray-, attosecond-, synchrotron- and ion-based research in chemistry.
