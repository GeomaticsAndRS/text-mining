  The main objective of this Action  was to strengthen existing networks in order to develop suitable, efficient and cost-effective methods for reactive and proactive response to viral diseases of plants for a sustainable agriculture. Specific primary objectives of this Action  were: 1. Co-ordinate frontier European research on plant virus control through gene silencing approaches. 2. Help develop novel non-transgenic control strategies for managing plant viral diseases in Europe. 3. Optimize protocols for high-throughput production and delivery of suitable resistance inducer molecules. 4. Transfer innovations to end-user groups (i.e. SMEs, plant protection organizations, growers  groups). 5. Disseminate results via publication of all meeting proceedings, developing a web site with bibliography and announcements for long-term networking.
