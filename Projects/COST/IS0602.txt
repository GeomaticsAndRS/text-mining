  The ILDC Action  aims to provide access to domestic case law concerning international law and to enhance understanding of its relevance for domestic and international law. A proper understanding of international law requires knowledge of the role of domestic jurisdictions. Until now, access to domestic case law has been limited. Many cases are unpublished, few translated into English, and even if they are available, their effects may not be fully understood without explanations about the underlying domestic legal system. ILDC will create a network of reporters and researchers who will analyse domestic cases and conduct research on the internationalisation of law and its development in domestic jurisdictions. ILDC aims to: - Make available judgments of domestic courts on matters of international law, where necessary to translate these judgments and to explain the domestic legal frameworks that produced them. - Feature in-depth commentaries written by a network of legal experts. - Inform and educate stakeholders about the domestic application of international law. - Analyse the larger consequences for international law. - Disseminate information to a wider audience.
