  New and unprecedented sources of geographic information have recently become available in the form of user-generated Web content. The integration and application of these sources, often termed volunteered geographic information (VGI), offers multidisciplinary scientists an unprecedented opportunity to conduct research on a variety of topics at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Since applications generating VGI are not often designed specifically for data production or analytical purposes, the Action  aims at the following to fill this gap, recognizing the potential value of these sources to the EU in citizen-based decision making by: 1) define VGI sources, share and develop data retrieval software, assess VGI quality, 2) define standardization criteria for interoperability with other datasets, 3) identify applications and transfer these applications to business implementation (market analysis, risk management, advertising, etc.). The Action  targets fundamental scientific and technological advances by establishing a European network of excellence on GeoWeb technologies.The Action  will focus on VGI and  gather efforts carried out in an innovative and under-exploited field of Web research and knowledge production. VGI  is particularly relevant as it provides information of citizens  preferences and concerns and is an alternative source of knowledge in a context where governments are putting less resources in data collection.
