  The main objective of EURO-FBP is to decrease the impact on human health from foodborne parasites (FBP), through establishing a risk-based control programme for FBP containing robust and appropriate protective strategies. EURO-FBP will use an interdisciplinary, One Health perspective to assimilate information, coordinate research and harmonize diagnostics, surveillance, analytical methods, potential interventions and mapping of global trends regarding FBP. The Action  will determine those FBP of greatest regional importance, pinpoint knowledge gaps, and focus resources strategically for control of FBP. FBP include protozoa, nematodes, cestodes and trematodes. Although a significant public health issue, FBP have been neglected compared with other foodborne pathogens such as viruses or bacteria. Furthermore, globalisation and changes in climate, agricultural practices, and human behaviour and lifestyles all contribute to emergence of FBP in new settings, with new hosts and transmission routes. Previously associated with specific regions, FBP are now spreading. FBP research is fragmented and groups often focus on a single genera or group of parasites. Hence COST is ideal for EURO-FBP, enabling collaboration among scientists that rarely interact. The agenda will focus on how to address FBP, optimising efforts and resources in order to control FBP in Europe - and globally.
