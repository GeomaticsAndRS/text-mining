  The main objective of the Action  is to promote research on the biomineralisation processes of selected land, freshwater and marine species for both environmental biomonitoring and as a source of new biomimetic strategies and materials. This Action  will bring together outstanding expertise in biomineralization research in a Europe-wide network that will promote a comprehensive approach to address emerging challenges in environmental monitoring and bio-nanotechnology. The work will focus on monitoring the embryonic development of selected marine organisms, on biochemical and crystallographic control mechanisms of the mineralization pathways in the embryonal and adult organisms, characterisation of specialised metabolic pathways in marine, freshwater, land and subterranean molluscs and to use these organisms in the biomonitoring of riverine and marine environments. In vivo manipulation of organisms at the biological level to create new inorganic materials will be carried out with the parallel development of strategies for new biomimetic routes to novel materials. The Action  will facilitate the coordination, transfer and dissemination of knowledge within Europe to foster world-class biomineralisation research through the integration of diverse, though complementary, disciplines, capacity building, enhanced competitiveness and the development of research cohesion between western and eastern European countries. Scientific knowledge gained under the Action  will be integrated in teaching curricula at participating universities around Europe, effectively broadening the scope of training of young scientists and creating a foundation for enhancing Europe s competitiveness in this area.
