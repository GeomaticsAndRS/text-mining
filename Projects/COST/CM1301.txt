  Electron-induced chemistry of volatile precursor molecules is central to Focused Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID), a very promising direct deposition technique for nanofabrication, capable of producing free-standing 3D structures of sub-10 nm size. However, to date, FEBID relies on precursors developed specifically for chemical vapour deposition (CVD), a thermally driven process. These precursors are not optimized for the electron-driven FEBID process. Thus, to reach its full scientific and commercial potential, molecular precursors particularly adapted to the electron-induced fragmentation mechanisms in FEBID are urgently needed. This requires a concerted approach linking fundamental knowledge on electron-driven chemistry in FEBID with rational design and chemical synthesis of novel, superior precursor molecules. The Action  will network the relevant research communities including both experiment and theory, to perform the fundamental research that is needed and to translate the generated knowledge to novel FEBID precursors. Participation of research groups in FEBID technology and industrial partners will further allow rapid transfer of the results into industrial processing. This unique programme will ensure that EU academia and industry remain the leaders in development and commercial exploitation of FEBID.
