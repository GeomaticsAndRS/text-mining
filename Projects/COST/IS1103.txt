  European societies are becoming ethnically and culturally more diverse, yet their health systems are failing to keep pace. This Action  aims to promote the adoption and implementation of policies responding to this increased diversity. It builds on the achievements of COST Action  IS0603 (Health and Social Care for Migrants and Ethnic Minorities  HOME), which reviewed health inequalities among migrants and ethnic minorities as well as the measures designed to remedy them. ADAPT will take this work forward, identifying obstacles to translating this knowledge into action as well as levers for change . Despite a remarkable increase in research and innovation in this area, as well as significant backing from international bodies, the pace of change in Europe remains slow. Few countries have adopted national policies on migrant and ethnic minority health and even where they have, implementation has encountered many obstacles. This Action  will make practical recommendations for promoting change. Interdisciplinary teams will identify bottlenecks and missed opportunities, while the pan-European nature of COST will provide a unique opportunity to identify the factors driving policy and implementation. The results will have implications for effective policy making and organisational change, not only in health but alsoin other fields of public policy.
