  Poultry ectoparasites are of particular concern for the European Industry. The poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae , is the most significant pest of laying hens in Europe. A relationship between infestation and hen mortality exists and at a sub-lethal level causes significant stress to birds and a decline in egg quality and production. The current norm of 50,000 PRM/hen, rising to 500,000 in extreme circumstances, and 80% PRM prevalence in most European countries cannot be considered acceptable, and must be reduced. This holds especially true as recent and impending legislation to improve hen welfare in this region will exacerbate the negative impact of this pest, compromising production and potentially exposing such legislation as counterintuitive in terms of overall hen health and welfare. COREMI will look to advance and disseminate comprehensive Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for PRM by collating knowledge of mite biology, the mite-host relationship and novel control and coordinating further research work in the area. This information will be used to produce industry Gold Standards  for PRM prevention and control, tailored to individual countries and production systems. A more complete understanding of PRM impact to poultry and other sectors, including public health, will also be achieved through the Action .
