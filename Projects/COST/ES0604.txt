  The proposed Action  brings together leading European scientists to address the issue of atmospheric water vapour and its impact on climate. This Action  is needed to integrate research carried out in different areas, including: atmospheric monitoring, data analysis and modelling. It brings together expertise that is both unique and timely. In order to make significant progress in the field of water vapour and climate, it is necessary to integrate knowledge acquired from research based on different methodologies. To achieve this, the Action  is structured into 4 working groups which together aim to increase knowledge on observations, theory, and data assimilation in the context of water vapour and climate. The objective is to offer to the scientific community and the broader Earth Observation community an integrative approach to understanding the processes controlling the atmospheric water vapour distribution, in particular those elements linking water vapour and climate. Beneficiaries of this Action  include the meteorological services, space agencies, environmental agencies and policy makers. The specific task of this Action  is to promote knowledge dissemination activities at various levels through scientific missions, thematic training schools, support toward conference participation, and special issues in world-class scientific journals.
