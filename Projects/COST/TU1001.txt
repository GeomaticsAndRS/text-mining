  While Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are now used in many countries for Transport capital projects, research has been, in principal, descriptive. PPPs are complex contractual arrangements extending into an unpredictable future and the economic crisis has highlighted many shortcomings. The scope of this proposal is to develop the theoretical basis for PPPs in the transport sector. Key objectives to be addressed on a national and modal perspective by the three  working groups are: (i) A decision making process for selection, implementation and operation of PPP transport projects considering sustainable procurement  and value propositions ; (ii) Identification of critical success factors, test criteria and knowledge-bases for improved PPP performance; (iii) Implications of the financial arrangement. Findings are cross-studied by auxiliary working groups focusing on the national context and the modal (urban, surface and port) context, respectively.
