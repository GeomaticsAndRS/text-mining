  Multi-functional and adaptive building envelopes can provide step-change improvements in the energy efficiency and economic value of new and refurbished buildings, while improving the wellbeing of building occupants. They therefore represent a significant and viable contribution to meeting the EU 2020 targets. There is a critical mass of European knowledge, expertise, resources, and skills in the fields relevant to adaptive facades, but the research efforts across the multi-disciplinary topics and the wide range of novel technologies are scattered across several R D centres in Europe. This Action  aims to harness this knowledge and will thereby generate new ideas and concepts at a fundamental and product/system development level. This will be achieved by creating a research network with a strong multidisciplinary approach, involving academics, industrial partners from the façade supply chain, and other stakeholders. The COST Action  will facilitate the sharing of experimental data, the development of modelling and simulation techniques, and the sharing of common evaluation methods. The work of this COST action is expected to from the basis for exploiting recent technological developments in adaptive façades and energy efficient buildings, and will help to train the future generation of façade R D professionals in Europe.
