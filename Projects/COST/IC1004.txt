  Smart Environments (SEs), like the human body, energy efficient buildings, vehicular or urban environments, are populated by many devices connected by wireless networks. The radio channel is central to SEs, as it impacts the design of transmission techniques and communication protocols. Radio communications in SEs need to be green and based on cooperative paradigms to mitigate the effect of interference and improve efficiency. This Action  addresses research issues in the field of cooperative radio communications to make our society cleaner, safer, and more energy efficient. The main goal of the Action  is to increase knowledge of cooperative communications applied to Green SEs (GSEs), by exploring and developing new methods, models, techniques, strategies and tools, in a context enriched by deep industry-academia links. Training of young researchers is also one of its main objectives, to be pursued e.g. via annual training schools. Europe will benefit from the activities of this Action , as GSEs will be one of the key components of the broader field (and exploding market) of the Internet of Things, a domain of interest to many large and small companies in Europe. COST is the ideal framework, as it allows very efficient cooperation among industries and academia.
