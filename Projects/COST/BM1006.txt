  Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a highly parallelised approach for quickly and economically sequencing new genomes, re-sequencing large numbers of known genomes, or for rapidly investigating transcriptomes under different conditions. Producing data on an unprecedented scale, these techniques are now driving the generation of knowledge (especially in biomedicine and molecular life sciences) to new dimensions. The massive data volumes being generated by these new technologies require new data handling and storage methods. Hence, the life science community urgently needs new, and improved approaches to facilitate NGS data management and analysis. This COST Action  unites bioinformaticians, computer scientists and biomedical scientists, harnessing their expertise to bring NGS data management and analysis to new levels of efficiency and integration. Rigorous surveillance of NGS technology and NGS-related software developments will allow the partners to generate software solutions for future NGS opportunities in a timely manner. The Action  will increase the ability of European groups to maximally benefit from NGS technology, and will create a nucleus for world-wide activities to jointly address the upcoming biomedical informatics revolution.
