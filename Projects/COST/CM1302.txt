  This Action  on Smart Inorganic Polymers (SIPs) will synergise the European activities in relevant areas in order to establish widely applicable rules for the rational design of smart inorganic polymers. The combination of leading scientists with common motivation but diverse expertise (main group/transition metal chemistry, polymer synthesis, characterisation, processing, applications, and theory) in concert with industrial partners will act as a nucleus for translational efforts towards the design and application of novel inorganic polymers (e.g., polyphosphazenes, polyamino- or phosphinoboranes, polysilanes, metallopolymers, nanoparticle-based hybrids). The network will coordinate and concentrate scattered existing national programmes and informal collaborations, which will be kick-started by including new complementary skills. SIPs will intensify the European exchange of knowledge and technologies and provide a forum for recent developments and innovative aspects. By implementing a sorely missed annual European conference on inorganic polymers, SIPs will increase its visibility in related communities. This will allow the systematic expansion of SIPs by inclusion of additional interested parties with desirable expertise and resources to boost the developments in this area.
