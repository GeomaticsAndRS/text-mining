  The application of the rapidly evolving -omics technologies to cancer research is a reality and it has demonstrated that large-scale international collaboration is essential to decipher relevant information in the context of massive-scale interrogations. This is even more important for rare and dreadful diseases like pancreas cancer (PDAC). We propose the creation of a unique European platform to facilitate the collaboration of a broad range of European and international PDAC multidisciplinary research groups to integrate knowledge and experience in a multidisciplinary way from cell to society ; promote the application of uniform study tools and protocols; foster their optimal use by early-stage researchers; enhance the mobility and training of researchers; and permeate the society with the results originated by the Action . This Action  will develop novel interdisciplinary tools that will improve our understanding of PDAC and its control by answering questions related to the aetiology, early detection and evidence-based and personalized treatment to enhance primary, secondary, an tertiary prevention, respectively, as well as on health management. The Action  brings together a group of young scholars across a range of disciplines in collaboration with more experienced researchers and will allow Europe to actively participate in the international scenario of pancreas cancer research.
