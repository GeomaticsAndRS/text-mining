  In the last two decades, the basis of scientific knowledge in timber engineering has developed immensely. The documented results, however, are inhomogeneous and fragmented and do not provide timber engineering community with the relevant information to prove the reliable and safe application of newly developed wood products in construction. The aim of the Action  is to overcome the gap between broadly available scientific results and the specific information needed by designers, industry, authorities and code committees, providing transfer for practical application in timber design and innovation. This will be achieved by the coordination, consolidation, harmonization and dissemination of recent efforts in research and development that aim at enhancing existing or deriving new methods and design rules for timber structures. The results of this Action  will increase the confidence of code-writers, authorities, designers and end-users in the safe, durable and efficient use of timber in structures and consequently increase its acceptance and use in the design of buildings.
