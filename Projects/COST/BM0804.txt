  The main objective of the Action  is to promote research on and use of small fish as models for human diseases via the establishment of a communication platform. This COST Action  will coordinate the distribution of these fish models and will disseminate contacts and knowledge to investigate the molecular and genetic basis of the disturbed physiology of these models. The main audience will be the wider biomedical research community and industry for a faster translation of research into medical applications and as in vivo systems for drug development and toxicity testing.
