  The past decade has gone through rapid ICT  developments, which had wide societal impacts. ICT  enhanced the shift from social groups defined by location to individually-based social networks.  High-speed telecoms allow for ad-hoc personalised networks that affect travel behaviour. Unfortunately, research has lagged behind ICT  advances, as our understanding of current travel behaviour is limited and existing urban mobility solutions cater to population behaviour that no longer exists. The transport demand models used today are based on inadequate understanding of the new social structure.  A new transport paradigm is needed for the ultra-urbanized smart city. This Action  aims to initiate a new collaboration framework for the various EU research groups that develops a new transport paradigm based upon ICT  social networks and their subsequent travel behavior in the urban environment. The goals are to explore ways in which social activities become mobilised in space,   identify how social ties affect the integration of local public transport into urban patterns,  and develop a rigorous conceptual framework for new ideas and methodologies.  This work will be achieved by creating a joint discussions platform that includes seminars, thematic working groups, discussion sessions, workshops and publishing scientific results.
