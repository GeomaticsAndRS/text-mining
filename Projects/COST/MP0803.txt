  The COST Action  will foster, coordinate and strengthen scientific and technological collaboration in plasmonics in Europe. Over the last 10 years, plasmonics - the optics of metallic nanostructures - has emerged as a very promising technology. Two key applications of plasmonics are the processing of optical information at the nanoscale and label free biosensing. The Action  will cover both fields of application, since similar fundamental and technological issues are at stake. Emphasis will be put on the integration of plasmonic components into CMOS and organic devices. The Action  will help bridge the gap between fundamental research and European industry; it will also develop and implement a strategy for education on plasmonics in Europe. Keywords: Plasmonics, photonics, nanophotonics, information technologies, biosensors, integration, metals.
