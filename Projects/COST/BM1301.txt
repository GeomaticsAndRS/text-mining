  Aldosterone is the major hormone regulating blood pressure. Alterations in blood levels of aldosterone and genetic mutations in its receptor MR are major causes of hypertension. Many of the drugs in clinical use and in development target aldosterone and MR actions and are an intense area of research in Europe.  The major reasons for launching this Action  are to 1) defragment and enhance the excellence of the European research in the field 2)  network leading European laboratories in aldosterone and MR research through training workshops/conferences, short to medium term study missions for early stage researchers leading to joint publications and grant proposals 3)  identify new signaling pathways of aldosterone/MR to uncover new therapeutic targets 4)  rapidly identify novel clinical outcomes of MR antagonists 5) develop new biomarkers of aldosterone/MR activation to better identify patients suited for such therapy 6)  stimulate and support pharmaceutical companies and SMEs to develop diagnostic tools and drugs. The ADMIRE COST Action  will harness a European network of experienced researchers benefiting from funded national research programmes.
