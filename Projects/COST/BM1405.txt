  Non-globular proteins (NGPs) encompass different molecular phenomena that defy the traditional sequence-structure-function paradigm. NGPs include intrinsically disordered regions, tandem repeats, aggregating domains, low-complexity sequences and transmembrane domains. Although growing evidence suggests that NGPs are central to many human diseases, functional annotation is very limited. It was recently estimated that close to 40% of all residues in the human proteome lack functional annotation and many of these are NGPs. While a better understanding of NGPs is crucial to fully comprehend human molecular physiopathology, progress has been hampered so far by the lack of a systematic approach to their study. This Action  Proposal aims to create a pan-European scientific network of groups that work on NGPs to strengthen, focus and coordinate research in this field. It proposes to develop a novel classification of NGPs by consensus among interested experts that will be showcased on a newly developed web site, along with meetings, training schools and scientific missions on NGP-related topics.
