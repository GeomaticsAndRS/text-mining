  Air quality is a key element for the well-being and quality of life of European citizens. It is regulated by EU legislation, which requires monitoring and assessment of air pollution (using modelling tools where there is no observational data), informing the public on air quality, forecasting the potential exceedances, implementation of short term action plans and air quality management to attain specific limit and target values. As air pollution crosses national borders, it would be cost-effective and beneficial for citizens and society and decision-makers that national chemical weather forecast and information systems would be networked and seamless across Europe. This Action will provide a forum for harmonizing, standardising and benchmarking approaches and practices in data exchange and multi-model capabilities for air quality forecast and (near) real-time information systems in Europe. It will examine existing and work out new solutions for integrating the development efforts at national and international levels. This Action will not develop or create the whole system, but rather support and complement ongoing initiatives (e.g., in the framework of GMES - Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) towards the same goals. In particular, it will serve as a platform for the information exchange between the meteorological services, environmental agencies, and international initiatives.
