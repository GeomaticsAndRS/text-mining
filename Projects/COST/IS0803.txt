  The significance of the eastern borders of Europe is currently changing. Through a focus on the informal, everyday aspects of this, the Action  draws together existing knowledge and develops new understandings of the combined social, moral and material elements of how these borders are experienced and thought about. Its aim is to develop a new approach for studying changes in the Eastern periphery of Europe, through: (a) exploring the process through which borders themselves become visible and meaningful (or disappear), rather than take borders for granted and then study their effects; (b) a simultaneous focus on what borders separate and what they bring together; (c) a focus on 'remaking borders,' which means studying understandings of possible futures as well as the past; (d) a focus on money, gender and sexuality, which in both empirical and conceptual terms brings together material, political, social and moral aspects of border-making and allows the study of 'border transgressions.' Unusually, this Action  draws together researchers focusing on the north-east (Baltics and environs) to the south-east (Balkans and environs); and it also combines empirical with conceptual specialists to tackle the complexities of what happens in everyday, informal terms around border regions during periods of transformation.
