  The main objective of this Action  is to develop a comprehensive techno-economic regulatory framework of radio spectrum access rules for CR/SDR-based wireless applications, catering for envisaged CR/SDR deployment scenarios and shown to benefit most optimally the development of the wireless industries and consumer interests at large. Furthermore, the Action  will provide assistance to European administrations in formulating a European position on radio spectrum access rules for CR/SDR applications. This Action  will establish a multi-disciplinary European forum focused on coordinating techno-economic studies for the development of a harmonised European regulatory framework to facilitate the advancement and broad commercial deployment of Cognitive Radio/Software Defined Radio (CR/SDR) systems. The Action  will leverage on results and experiences from national and international research initiatives and early standard-setting activities by recommending sound regulatory policies that would facilitate fastest possible uptake and proliferation of CR/SDR. The need for this Action  has been supported by European regulators in the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT). They stated willingness to use the results of the Action  in their work on developing the harmonised European regulatory regime for CR/SDR. Very conveniently, proposals elaborated by the Action  could also be used as a part of European contributions to the forthcoming World Radiocommunications Conference in 2012, which has CR/SDR regulatory policy on its agenda.
