  Communications and sensing in varying wireless environments require resilient, adaptive antenna systems for reliable data transmission and seamless access to various infrastructures. The emergence of new technologies in radio coding and the need for more efficient use of the spectral and energy resources shifts antenna system design towards cross-disciplinary approaches, covering electromagnetic field theory, RF engineering, signal processing, integrated fabrication technologies and even micro- and nano-technologies. With these new challenges, it is vital to review the existing expertise and direct the efforts in the right direction. This Action  identifies key research topics, facilitating the networking and coordination between different R D teams. The objectives are to assess the needs for the new technologies and applications, to foster the development of radiating systems in green, smart environments, to provide the necessary supporting technologies and to promote the career start of young researchers.
