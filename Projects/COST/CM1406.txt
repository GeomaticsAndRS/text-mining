  Epigenetics refers to dynamic changes that occur at the DNA, RNA and protein level in eukaryotes. Epigenetics is at the heart of gene regulation and determines which genes are activated or silenced. It is of great importance fundamentally and has many exciting translational aspects including therapeutics, microbial pathway engineering and agriculture. The key objective of the Action  is to establish the first European chemical biology network focused on epigenetics. This Action  will provide common ground for researchers from academia, research institutes, SMEs and multinational organizations.The fruitful interactions between these sectors will lead to the creation of new chemical tools as well as leads for therapeutics and agrochemicals. The Action 's second objective is to increase awareness of epigenetics within the European scientific community and it will provide training for ESRs and emphasise inclusiveness by COST priority member countries.
