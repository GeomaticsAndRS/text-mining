  1. Objectives The main objective of the Action  is to achieve a general method for homogenising climate and environmental datasets. The method will be an improved synthesis of the most effective statistical procedures for detection and correction of Essential Climate Variables at different space and time scales. The main objective will be accomplished through fulfilling the following secondary objectives: - Provide practical rules for the implementation of homogenisation. - Provide tools for comparison and evaluation of different methods. - Analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the methods for different applications. - Provide methods for evaluating uncertainties resulting from homogenisation. - Provide an evaluation of specific artificial changes, such as the impact of urban effect on temperature series for example. This will be applicable to commonly observed datasets (temperature, precipitation, air-pressure, vapour-pressure, sunshine duration ) as well as upper-air observations (radiosonde data), data provided by numerical weather forecast models, reanalysis data and climate proxy data.
