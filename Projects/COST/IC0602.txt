  The Action  aims to put together researchers coming from different fields such as Decision Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in order to improve decision support in presence of massive data bases, combinatorial structures, partial and/or uncertain information and distributed, possibly interoperating decision makers. Such problems arise in several real world decision problems such as humanitarian logistics, homeland security, epidemiology, risk assessment and management, e-government and the implementation of recommender systems. The Action  will coordinate ongoing research projects and provide a more solid framework to already existing networked activities. Keywords: Decision Theory, Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Efficiency, Uncertainty Management, Decision Support, Robustness.
