  PERSPECT-H2O will enable spectroscopy/theory guided design of supramolecular photocatalysts for water splitting, and hence the generation of molecular hydrogen as a renewable fuel. The network will integrate leading European groups and national research centers, focusing on a central theme of contemporary research in homogeneous photocatalysis and integration of supramolecular photocatalysts towards the construction of functional materials. The Action  combines synthetic chemistry, photophysics and photochemistry, electrochemistry, and theory aiming at (i) a detailed molecular mechanistic understanding of photoinduced reaction steps in supramolecular photocatalytic water splitting, and (ii) development of functional systems. The envisioned approach identifies relations between molecular and electronic structure, photoinduced structural and electronic dynamics, catalytic efficiency, and the stability of long-lived intermediates and catalytically active species. Finally it yields functional photocatalytic materials based on earth-abundant elements and prototypes of supramolecular photocatalytic water-splitting systems.
