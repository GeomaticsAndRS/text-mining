  The main objective of the Action  is to develop verification technology with the reach and power to assure dependability of object-oriented programs on industrial scale. Software is vital for modern society. The efficient development of correct and reliable software is of ever growing importance. This Action  will concentrate on program verification: the construction of logical proofs that programs are correct. Logic-based technologies for the formal description, construction, analysis, and validation of software can be expected to complement and partly replace traditional software engineering methods in the future. Already, program verification methods have outgrown the area of academic case studies, and industry is showing serious interest. The logical next goal is the verification of industrial software products. Most programming languages used in industrial practice (such as Java, C++, and C#) are object-oriented. The Action  will therefore focus on the verification of programs written in object-oriented languages and the particular problems this entails. Keywords: program verification, formal methods in software engineering, program logics, formal specification, program correctness
