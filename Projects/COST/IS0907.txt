  The main objective of the Action  is to advance scientific knowledge about ways of improving maternity care provision and outcomes for mothers, babies and families across Europe by understanding what works, for who, in what circumstances , and by identifying and learning from the best. Around 4.7 million European women experience childbirth annually. Optimal maternal and infant health is critical to societal well-being. Survival rates have improved, but there are now concerns about iatrogenic morbidity. There are significant cross-EU differences in maternity care cultures, philosophies, organisation, uptake, and outcomes. This Action  will advance scientific knowledge about ways of improving maternity care provision and outcomes by examining what works, for who, in what circumstances, and by identifying and learning from the best. The work will include an examination of first trimester prenatal diagnosis, routine intrapartum interventions for low risk women, and care for migrant women. Bringing all maternity care in Europe up to the standard of the best is the ultimate aim of the Action .
