  Recent technological advances in hardware and software have irrevocably affected the classical picture of computing systems. Today, these no longer consist only of connected servers, but involve a wide range of pervasive and embedded devices, leading to the concept of "ubiquitous computing systems". The objective of the Action  is to improve and adapt the existent cryptanalysis methodologies and tools to the ubiquitous computing framework. Cryptanalysis, which is the assessment of theoretical and practical cryptographic mechanisms designed to ensure security and privacy, will be implemented along four axes: cryptographic models, cryptanalysis of building blocks, hardware and software security engineering, and security assessment of real-world systems. Researchers have only recently started to focus on the security of ubiquitous computing systems. Despite the critical flaws found, the required highly-specialized skills and the isolation of the involved disciplines are a true barrier for identifying additional issues. The Action  will establish a network of complementary skills, so that expertise in cryptography, information security, privacy, and embedded systems can be put to work together. The outcome will directly help industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies to increase security and privacy in ubiquitous computing systems, in order to eventually make citizens better protected in their everyday life.
