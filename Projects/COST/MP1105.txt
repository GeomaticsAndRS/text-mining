  Replacement of existing flame retardants (FR) with sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives for  textiles in domestic, safety, transport (automotive, rail, aerospace and marine), civil emergency and military, construction and other industries requires a multidisciplinary approach from textile technology to the physics and chemistry of fire. This Action  will create an international multidisciplinary scientific and technology network on Sustainable Flame Retardancy, developing new innovative flame retardants with low fire toxicity and environmental impacts and halogen-free. A COST Action  is ideal to promote the existing cooperation in flame retardancy research, in order to accelerate growth to keep Europe leading the world in this crucial area, taking into account sustainability, safety and health, and to facilitate its commercial exploitation in Europe.
