  The main objective of the Action  is to improve the understanding of proton and metal ion translocation across bio-membranes and the fate of such chemicals following their uptake by bridging neighbouring scientific fields and fostering applicative outcomes. "Molecular machineries for ion translocation across biomembranes" is a strongly interdisciplinary COST Action  aiming at coordinating the research efforts of the participant groups in elucidating mechanistic details of proton and metal transfer processes and in exploring their potential applications in the biosynthesis of new materials and in the environment. The Action  is organised in four Working Groups whose coordinated activities will help to generate a more detailed description of how protons and metal cations and oxyanions are translocated across biological membranes, how they interact with their target proteins having crossed the membrane and how these metabolic processes can be controlled and eventually utilised for the biosynthesis of nanostructured inorganic and metal materials and in bioremediation.
