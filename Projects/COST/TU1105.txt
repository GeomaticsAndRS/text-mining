  The socio-economic quest towards developing transportation with lower CO2 emission is a global goal of the EU and a crucial ingredient for the competitiveness of the whole European transportation industry. It forces an increased focus on alternative powering systems such as electric and hybrid drives. To be competitive, however, such vehicles must have an acceptable Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) behaviour, not only inside the vehicle, but also outside if it is nor to pose major concerns regarding safety of weaker road users such as two-wheelers and pedestrians. Most of the NVH design and problem-solving knowledge gathered has concentrated on internal combustion vehicles and so novel analysis techniques have to be developed for vehicles with these new drives. In addition the limited knowledge on electric and hybrid vehicles is scattered all over Europe. The aim of this Action  is to engage NVH experts from vehicle industry and renowned research groups in the accumulation, development and dissemination of such novel techniques. The COST framework provides the unique opportunity to bring together experienced academic and early-stage researchers, EU authorities for transport regulations, independent consultants, experienced representatives from industry and associations of transporters.
