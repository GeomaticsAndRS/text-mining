  Microvesicles and Exosomes  (ME)  have attracted much recent interest because of their potential functions, use as disease biomarkers and possible therapeutic exploitation. Due to their enormous relevance, through nationally-funded projects throughout Europe, this relatively new field of research is quickly expanding. There are, however, many associated issues that need to be addressed to ensure optimal research performance and collation and cross-interpretation of data. These issues range from the need to derive a consensus on fundamental guidelines/nomenclature and optimal techniques for vesicle isolation and analysis, to more advanced issues such as collating emerging data and expertise towards better understanding, and thus exploiting, the physiological and pathological roles of ME. There is also urgency to identify gaps in ME knowledge and how best collaborative research can address these questions. This COST Action  will, therefore, create a network of European experts, fostering a multidisciplinary approach to enhance both basic understanding and translational potential of ME. To achieve this, this Action  will bring together a critical, yet currently fragmented, mass of academic, clinical and industry expertise from COST and non-COST countries in a field where Europe plays a leadership role, while developing a forum for free-exchange of concepts and training of young European researchers.
