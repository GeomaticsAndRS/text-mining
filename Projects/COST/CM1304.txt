  Complex chemical systems have a huge potential for delivering new applications in areas ranging from materials science (in the short term) to medicine (in the long term). Complex systems are also highly relevant to fundamental questions such as the origin of life. Research on complex chemical systems has developed in parallel in three poorly connected communities working on supramolecular chemistry, far-from-equilibrium systems and the origin of life, respectively. This proposal aims to establish Europe as a world-leader in the emerging area of complex chemical systems, by bringing together these research fields. Main objectives are to develop far-from-equilibrium self-assembly and self-replicating systems, self-assembling and reproducing compartments, and the use of information-rich molecules in these contexts. The approach to these subjects is inherently multidisciplinary and will only be possible by combining the expertise of different theoretical and experimental research groups around Europe.
