  The Action 's main objective is to create a research platform on the relationship between Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) and the production of public open spaces, and their relevance to sustainable urban development. The impacts of this relationship will be explored from social, ecological and urban design perspectives. ICT  is a driving force, media and tool, which operates as a mediator between users and their virtual and real worlds. Public spaces have multiple functions, including social gathering places where outdoor interactions between people can occur and communication and information exchange can take place. The relationship between ICT  devices and public open spaces is not new but is growing at a rapid pace, becoming a challenge for ICT  experts, spatial planners and social scientists. ICTs cause and enable innovative outdoor social practices which challenge spatial and social experts to use them in policies, methodologies, design and research to produce responsive and inclusive urban places. The Action  deals with opportunities and risks ICTs offer to the user, via the appreciation, design and usage of public spaces. It exploits the benefits of interweaving a green experience with digital engagement via sharing knowledge, experiences and ideas, and analysing public spaces.
