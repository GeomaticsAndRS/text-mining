  Forest growth models are important tools within research to investigate and understand key ecosystem processes and to support forest management decisions. Sustainable forest management requires detailed information on tree growth and forest dynamics, including structural development, biodiversity indicators, and effects of disturbances. This is reflected in increasing emphasis, throughout Europe, on more detailed, versatile forest growth models which are able to forecast forest growth, account for changes in growing conditions, address risks and society needs and explicitly address forest management and its role within sustainable development. The main objective of the Action  is to promote the developing of methodologies to improve forest models to support the sustainable management of forests. The Action  will enhance the quality and consistency of forest growth models to simulate the responses of forests to alternative managerial and climate scenarios. The Action  will also demonstrate variations in regional concepts as they have evolved depending on the background of the model developers and society needs. This will be beneficial for the advancement of forest science in Europe, and will improve sustainable forest management practices.
