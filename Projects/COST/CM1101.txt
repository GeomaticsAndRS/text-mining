  Colloid chemistry is a steadily growing field of immense importance. The enormous diversity of the colloidal processes involved in novel materials and their applications in both advanced technologies and everyday life cannot be overstated. There is a compelling need for exchange, coordination and cooperation in the European colloid community. This Action  will combine coherently the outstanding European expertise in this field, including: theoretical modelling and experimental formation of functional and patterned interfaces; self-assembly of molecules and colloidal particles; synthesis and up-scaling of novel nano-colloidal and bio-colloidal materials; the kinetic and catalytic aspects of these novel materials; and their applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries, as well as in nano-devices such as sensors, assays, photonics and bio-fuel cells. This includes many of the Grand Challenges in energy, health and environmental protection. The Action  will provide a platform for coordination of national programs and will stimulate academia-industry cooperation. The Action s main deliverables will be the increased networking in colloid chemistry through the organization of scientific events (conferences, workshops), training schools and STSMs. Through an extensive mobility program targeted to early stage researchers, it will encourage their involvement in the research at the international level.
