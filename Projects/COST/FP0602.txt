  This Action  aims at developing innovative biosciences and technologies required to build and implement advanced lignocellulose biorefineries. The primary objective is to develop environmentally sound and cost-effective biotechnical tools and production technologies to be exploited in the production of fibres, chemicals and bioenergy. European industry and R D already have a strong position within white biotechnology. This Action  would strengthen the position of Europe in the areas of white biotechnology and lignocellulose-based biorefineries. The Action  will be organized into three areas: 1) development of new biotechnical tools; enzymes and micro-organisms, 2) application of enzymatic tools and processing methods to improve the competitiveness of renewable fibre products and 3) production of second generation biofuels, bio-based polymers and chemicals. The Action  will work closely together with the European forestry-agro sector and industry. The participating experts are active in a broad range of related scientific fields (enzymology, genetics, biochemical engineering, polymer chemistry, fibre technologies). The Action  will contribute to the further development and implementation of biorefineries, thereby assisting the member countries to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for sustainable energy supply and bio-based economy.
