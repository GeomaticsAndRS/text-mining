   Due to its broad definition and understanding culture  can be regarded as a fundamental issue, even a precondition to be met on the path towards Sustainable Development (SD) that is necessary to get to grips with in our various European societies. Yet the theoretical and conceptual understanding of culture within the general frames of sustainability remains vague. Consequently, the role of culture in the political framework of sustainable development is poorly operationalised. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this proposed COST- Action  is to increase understanding of and determine the role of culture in SD based on multidisciplinary principles. The work will be carried out 1) by investigating and operationalizing the concept of culture in the context of SD through multidisciplinary approaches and analyses; 2) by examining the best practices for bringing culture into policy and practical domains, and 3) by developing means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on SD. The results of the Actions  will be exploited by the scientific community, policy makers, administrative personnel and practitioners working with sustainability and culture from the EU to the local level.
