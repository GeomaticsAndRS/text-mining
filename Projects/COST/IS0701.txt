  1. Main/primary objectives The main objective of the Action  is to enhance international collaboration to produce cross-country comparative research using improved data to study the firm-level sources of economic growth and the consequences of the growth process for workers. 2. Secondary objectives Stimulate international collaboration and widen the network to more participants, including earlystage and under-represented researchers (through conferences and workshops: 2 conferences expected, one in Year 1, the other in Year 3; 8-12 workshops expected in Years 2 and 4). Use firm-level data to analyze the microeconomic sources of economic growth and the consequences for workers (through publications of books and working papers: 2-4 books and 40-60 papers anticipated). Bring together academic researchers with policy makers and data providers from National Statistical Institutions (with expected proportions: 50%, 20%, 30%). Share of data and econometric methodologies among researchers. Share methods of data collection, variable definition, and access and confidentiality among data providers. Work to include and mentor junior researchers and to improve the gender balance (with the goal of at least 50% early stage and at least 33% women). Develop the capacity of new member states, East European, and former Soviet economies to produce high quality firm-level data and the scholarly abilities to analyze them. Draw out policy implications of the research wherever possible and encouraging participants to publish such implications (20-40 policy briefs expected). Encourage interdisciplinarity in recognition of the multi-faceted nature of the economic and social problems addressed in this research (sociologists, political scientists, demographers, geographers, and representatives of industry to be invited to the Conferences and Working Groups).
