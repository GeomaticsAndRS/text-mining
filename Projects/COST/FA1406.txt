  Seaweeds (macroalgae) are an alternative, additional source of food, feed, fuel and livelihood for humans. Currently 16M tonnes of seaweeds are collected annually for consumption or industrial processing. Production could increase, especially in Europe (only 7% of the world s production), with more appropriate and efficient seaweed cultivation techniques, to match actual and future demands. This requires a step-change in knowledge of basic seaweed biology (currently almost non-existent), to prevent restricting future increases in seaweed production. This COST Action  will develop a European interdisciplinary platform integrating unique expertise, currently scattered worldwide, to (1) fill basic research gaps on seaweed development and reproduction, and (2) transfer this scientific knowledge to aquaculture end-users to support sustainable seaweed aquaculture. Academic partners highly skilled in seaweed basic research, and RTD and Innovation Institutes dedicated to the transfer of knowledge to end-users, will coordinate and promote research through 4 major scientific tasks: Identifying how seaweeds become REPRODUCTIVELY PROFICIENT; Defining mechanisms of FERTILISATION AND EMBRYOGENESIS; Studying the kinetics and morphological principles of ADULT GROWTH; Developing TECHNICAL TOOLS to drive Tasks 1-3. This will be achieved via workshops, short-term scientific missions, training schools and symposia, and deployment of communication tools optimising the transfer from basic research to innovation.
