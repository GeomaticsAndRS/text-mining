  Concerning the transfer of E ngineered N anomaterials from wastewater T reatment  stormwat E r to R ivers (ENTER) the following issues require clarification: (i) which and (ii) what amounts of Engineered NanoMaterials (ENMs) are released, (iii) how persistent are they and (iv) to what extent do they cause in situ  toxicity? Reasons for knowledge gaps are a lack of suitable analytical methods, insufficient databases on usage and release, and the absence of comprehensive monitoring networks. ENTER will help to advance scientific knowledge on release and fate of ENMs in the urban water cycle and to communicate expert knowledge in an appropriate manner to the non-scientific community. ENTER will break down barriers between scientific and public pressure groups by an intensified scientific exchange via, e.g., the position papers. The ENTER products are needed to improve the decision-making process by supporting end users such as politicians, the EU and national public servants. ENTER will clearly aid to advance the understanding on the transport and transformation processes of ENMs released to the urban wastewater systems and to understand the transfer of ENMs to the aquatic environment. This Action  will improve the collaboration between scientists and the public by striking a new path towards an efficient knowledge exchange.
