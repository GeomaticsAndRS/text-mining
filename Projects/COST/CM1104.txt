  Reducible metal oxides are most versatile solid state compounds exhibiting a rich chemistry related to changes of the metal oxidation state. As complex materials like porous networks, nanocrystals and functionalised surfaces, they play a paramount role in (photo)catalysis, microelectronics, energy conversion and storage, sensor and fuel cell technologies. The Action  unites objective driven experimental and theoretical research devoted to (1) exploring the origins and details of reducibility in oxides, (2) creating novel routes for the growth and synthesis of nanostructured reducible oxide systems, (3) exploiting and tailoring reducibility in oxide systems to yield specific functionalities and (4) exploring novel applications and visionary concepts for the future use of reducible oxide materials. The gained fundamental understanding opens up new ways to explore, control, and tailor chemical reactivity, thus facilitating rational design of novel oxide structures with unique properties. This allows establishing trend-setting technologies and fosters advances by related European industries. European experts coordinating their highly innovative joint research on reducible oxides via this Action  will address important future societal and economic issues like efficient and green synthesis of chemicals and environmentally friendly energy conversion.
