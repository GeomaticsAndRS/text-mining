  The objective of this COST Action  is to develop supramolecular systems that work in water. Such supramolecular systems should allow to (i) monitor environmentally or biologically relevant species in water (ii) control selectivity of reactions in water, and (iii) produce self-assembled organized structures in water which are stimuli responsive and which can be used for programming functions in materials and devices. The Action  aims at improving our understanding of the multiple weak non-covalent, but collectively powerful interactions that allow efficient and selective recognition processes to occur in water.
