  This Action  connects scattered European Biochar research to enable quick implementation of intelligent material flow management systems, to maintain or improve soil quality while efficiently sequestering carbon in the long-term. Innovative Biochar strategies can help the EU mitigating greenhouse gases, while industries and farmers benefit from new markets, opportunities and use of improved soils, e.g. for biofuel production without endangering food supply. However, a risk assessment is necessary to protect food web and human health. Current Biochar research is often fragmented, unnecessarily repeated, and new scientific evidence is not connected or implemented, due to the lack of interaction and knowledge exchange. Therefore, this Action  aims at coordinating European Biochar research, bringing together researchers, stakeholders and potential users from EU and candidate countries. This will be accomplished by annual Biochar Workshops, Short-Term Missions among EU young, senior and female researchers, Training Schools, and an internet platform to monitor and streamline Biochar R D. Four working groups will focus on (i) Biochar production and characterisation, (ii) land use implementation, (iii) economic analysis including life cycle assessment and (iv) environmental impact assessment. The Action  will thus strengthen EU s leadership in the increasing competition with non-European Biochar actors.
