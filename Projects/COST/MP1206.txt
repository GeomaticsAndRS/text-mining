  Electrospinning, an electro-hydrodynamic process is a versatile and promising platform technology for the production of electrospun nanofibrous materials consisting of diverse polymers and polymer composites. This platform process can provide bio- or oil based polymer nanofibrous materials for the fabrication of innovative biomedical devices and for the fabrication of new technical applications. By forming an interdisciplinary knowledge platform, the Action  will strengthen the European R TD on electrospun nanofibrous materials and nanofibrous composites and will generate fast progress in the state of the art. The Action  will cover scientific breakthroughs and innovations in the electrospinning process itself, nanofibrous materials and nanofibrous composite advancements and the post treatment processing of electrospun materials. Applications in the biomedical and technical fields as well as health, societal and environmental issues are considered. The main outcome of the Action  will be: New integrated methodologies for designing and producing electrospinning nanofibres Databases of application-relevant electrospun nanofibre properties An up to date knowledge base on electrospun nanofibres and its applications Tutorial material for training young researchers entering the field.
