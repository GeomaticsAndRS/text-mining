  Soil is a non-renewable ecosystem resource under seriously pressure by land use, urbanisation and climate change. Soil organic matter (SOM) is key to soil fertility, climate change mitigation, combatting land degradation, and the conservation of above- and below-ground biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. Existing models of SOM dynamics are defined mostly in terms of plant residues input and microbial decomposition, overlooking the important contribution of soil fauna activity. Here, we bring biogeochemists and soil ecologists together to develop a research network for improved SOM models by implementing the role of the soil fauna as a basis for sustainable soil management. An international interdisciplinary approach within a COST Action  is envisaged as the proper platform for both experimentalists and modellers to provide solutions. Deliverables will be provided through workshops addressing key challenges in SOM / soil fauna experimentation and modelling, support of research exchange, education of young scientists and better access to experimental data. The Action  will be organised within four Working Groups to address: 1. Knowledge gap analysis of SOM â  soil fauna interaction; 2. Potentials and limitations for inclusion of soil fauna effects in SOM modelling; 3. Data assemblage and data sharing; 4. Knowledge management and advocacy training;
