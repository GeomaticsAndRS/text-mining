  The objective of this Action  is to understand the rapidly emerging role of the neural extracellular matrix (ECM) in brain function and dysfunction, by synergising European research in this multidisciplinary domain. The synergy is essential to study complex interaction between ECM, neurons and glial cells, which have historically represented separate fields of science. This Action  will be instrumental to address the following scientific questions: what are the functional properties of different ECM components in the brain, which new research tools are in need to study neural ECM, which ECM molecules are linked to brain disorders, which drugs can target them, and how to synthesize three dimensional ECM scaffolds that would mimic specific forms of neural ECM and guide reconstitution of neural circuits.The future economic/societal benefits from this Action  will be development of novel ECM-based therapeutic strategies for major neurological, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, dementia, schizophrenia, and mental retardation.
