  The main objective of this Action  is to focus the European activities in the field of organocatalysis in order to promote this field to a higher scientific level. As a result a higher utilization of the innovative potential of organocatalysis is expected. The main idea of this COST Action  - called ORCA (organocatalysis) - is to provide a knowledge platform to advance different kinds of organocatalyzed transformations to broadly applicable methods in academia as well as in industry. The large number of publications and activities in the field of enantioselective catalysis requires a concentration of different developments and efforts of organocatalytic transformations. There is also a need to supply the scientific community with systematic information and data. A welcome stage to this objective is the COST Action . This program will allow interaction between European scientists within this network. The exchange of all available data, ideas and methodologies will give a significant push for further developments in organocatalysis. Beneficiaries of this Action  will be researchers of industry and academia as well as young researchers.
