  The main objectives of this Action  are to develop an enhanced capacity for scholarly analysis of the emergence of Southern Multinationals to establish and test empirically their impact on Europe and its stakeholders; to assess existing EU wide and country policies in relation to this phenomenon and make policy recommendations. Traditionally Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has flowed from advanced developed economies into developed and developing countries. More recently a new trend has emerged in the pattern of FDI. Outward bound FDI from emerging economies has begun to increase significantly and has been growing at a faster pace than FDI from the advanced developed world. The Action  seeks to develop and sustain an international research network to study the impact of this new phenomenon for Europe and its stakeholders. The goal of the network is to implement a research agenda that will be of value to all stakeholders and policy makers in Europe as they grapple with this facet of globalisation.
