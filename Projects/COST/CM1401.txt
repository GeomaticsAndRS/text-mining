  A large variety of chemical compounds, from hydrides to complex organic species, is observed in star and planet forming regions. These complex species are also detected in present-day comets and meteorites, possibly as witnesses of the early stages of Solar System formation. An active chemistry proceeds in the harsh environments of pre-stellar cores and proto-planetary disks, where UV photons or X-rays irradiate cold diluted gases and ices, and radicals are copiously produced. The aim of this Action  is to bring together laboratory and theoretical gas phase and surface chemistry as well as large facilities based experiments with the aim of rationalizing the molecular evolution. Specific markers, such as isotopic fractionation, ices composition, and abundance ratios of isomers, must be used and understood, in order to draw a coherent picture of our chemical origins. Succeeding former European initiatives that shaped the field of Astrochemistry, this Action  focuses on the molecular evolution towards higher complexity. Being a stepping-stone for building models, the Action  would deliver new schemes for physical chemistry at large, like chemistry of transient species and photochemistry, in gas or on surfaces.
