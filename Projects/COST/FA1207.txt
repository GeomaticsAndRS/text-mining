  For several decades, poultry production worldwide has been struggling with severe diseases and huge economic losses caused by Avian Coronavirus (AvCoV) infections. Control of the disease is hampered by the variations within this virus family. As a result of its variability, the nomenclature as well as detection methods and classification of the virus strains are not consistent. This Action  creates a network between scientists with expertise in AvCoV. It stimulates cooperation between researchers, fosters harmonization of nomenclature and classification, and facilitates surveillance. In order to achieve this and to cover all important aspects, five interlinked Working Groups are established which deal with Molecular Virology, Serology and Immunology, Clinic and Pathology, Epidemiology and conceptualizing an infrastructure for collaborative research, respectively. Furthermore, a joint website is created where general information on AvCoV, notifications of outbreaks and research results are shared between the COST members. COST is the ideal platform to accomplish the described aims as different research projects concerning AvCoV are currently funded. The COST Action  provides the possibility to connect researchers working on the topic and thereby enabling them to use their resources more efficiently. European poultry producers, industry, veterinarians and consumers will benefit from results generated in the course of this Action .
