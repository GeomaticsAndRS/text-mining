  This Action  will focus on a new detection paradigm based on sensing technologies at low cost for Air Quality Control (AQC) and set up an interdisciplinary top-level coordinated network to define innovative approaches in sensor nanomaterials, gas sensors and devices, wireless sensor-systems, distributed computing, methods, models, standards and protocols for environmental sustainability within the European Research Area ( ERA ). The state-of-the-art showed that research on innovative sensing technologies for AQC based on advanced chemical sensors and sensor-systems at low-cost, including functional materials and nanotechnologies for eco-sustainability applications, the outdoor/indoor environment control, olfactometry, air-quality modelling, chemical weather forecasting, and related standardisation methods is performed already at the international level, but still needs serious efforts for coordination to boost new sensing paradigms for research and innovation. Only a close multidisciplinary cooperation will ensure cleaner air in Europe and reduced negative effects on human health for future generations in smart cities, efficient management of green buildings at low CO 2 emissions, and sustainable economic development. The objective of the Action  is to create a cooperative network to explore new sensing technologies for low-cost air-pollution control through field studies and laboratory experiments to transfer the results into preventive real-time control practises and global sustainability for monitoring climate changes and outdoor/indoor energy efficiency. Establishment of such a European network, involving Non-COST key-experts, will enable EU to develop world capabilities in urban sensor technology based on cost-effective nanomaterials and contribute to form a critical mass of researchers suitable for cooperation in science and technology, including training and education, to coordinate outstanding R D and promote innovation towards industry, and support policy-makers.
