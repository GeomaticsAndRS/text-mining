  NANONET will establish the first scientific platform to focus and integrate the exciting new knowledge on intermediate filaments with novel developments in cell biology, molecular biology, medicine, (bio)chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. This COST Action  will enable the synergistic development of novel collaborative research projects to deliver a multi-disciplinary understanding of cell homeostasis and its vulnerabilities in health and disease. NANONET will elevate and promote awareness of these important nanofilaments, increasing knowledge of their nanomechanical and biological properties from which new therapies and treatments for the health and well-being of the European people will emerge. The COST Action  will capture the commercial applications of this new knowledge and take advantage of current scientific advances in the field.
