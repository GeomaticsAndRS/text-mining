  Nanotechnology produces engineered nanomaterials (ENM) having new or enhanced physico-chemical properties in comparison to their micron-sized counterparts. Some of these properties, like the high surface area to volume ratio, make them potentially dangerous to humans as shown by research in Nanotoxicology. To promote the development of a new generation of ENM that are safe-by-design, an understanding of the relationship between the ENM STRUCTURE and the biological activity is needed. In this context, Quantitative Nanostructure-Toxicity Relationships (QNTR) computational modelling technique is an effective alternative to experimental testing since it enables the prediction of (eco)-toxicological effects based on ENM structure only. The construction of QNTR model requires the integration of expertise of nanomaterial scientists, (eco)-toxicologists, and modellers from academia, regulatory agencies and industry. Therefore, a network for trans-disciplinary cooperation is needed. Thus, this Action  will promote the coordination of these inter-disciplinary collaborations of different parties with the ultimate aim of producing QNTR models for ENM. The important benefits from MODENA include: (i) the development of a new generation of safe-by-design ENM; (ii) the effective reduction of animal testing and (iii) The creation of transparent, validated and rigorous QNTR tools for regulatory purposes in the field of nanotoxicology according to OECD principles.
