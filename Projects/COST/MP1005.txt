  Regenerative medicine is a new discipline based on biomaterial development and increasing knowledge in cell science. NAMABIO will be focused only in the interdisciplinary research related to biomaterials and stem cells of interest for the regenerative medicine of bones and teeth. The aim of NAMABIO is to coordinate research efforts (very often loosely correlated) of several actors belonging to different disciplines necessary in order to obtain a real breakthrough in these areas. In particular the partners of the present project are scientists involved in the following activities: (a)processing of innovative biomaterials (b) chemical, physical and mechanical characterization (c) modeling of physical and mechanical properties (d) stem cells loading on biomaterials, implantation on animals, and histological and molecular evaluation (e) 3D structural characterization of tissue engineered bones and teeth by X-ray synchrotron microtomography (or holotomography) (f) Biomedical evaluation of the results obtained in (e). The networking action will be carried out by meetings, workshops and seminars, STSMs, schools conferences and common publications.
