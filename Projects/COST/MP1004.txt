  The recent turmoil in global economy once more dramatically raised the currently unsatisfied demand for appropriate energy storage solutions. In these circumstances it was highlighted once more that the topic of energy storage solutions deserves to be treated with increased attention from scientists and engineers and from the society as a whole. The Action  addresses hybrid energy storage devices and systems based on innovative materials and technologies as well as on innovative system architecture.  Innovative materials and material processing for improved energy storage devices and associated intelligent  hybrid solutions will emerge from improved de-fragmentation and the enhancement of multidisciplinary and multinational cooperation during this Action . In this manner the Action  will strengthen the competitiveness of the European industry in this field and provide a framework for European responses to the economic and societal need for resource efficient, environmentally-friendly and reliable solutions for transport and energy.
