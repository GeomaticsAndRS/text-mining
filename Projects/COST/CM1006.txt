  The main objective is to attain a concerted, organised collaborative research activity that effectively focuses on areas of strategic importance to f-element chemistry in Europe and to foster an environment where, via a multi-group approach (including industry), remarkably novel, transformative f-element research is delivered which forms the basis for, or is, inter- and multi-disciplinary in nature. f-Element chemistry (the block of 28 elements at the bottom of the periodic table) contributes to medical imaging, magnetic, electronic, and photonics devices, catalysis, energy, and metal extraction and is therefore strategically crucial to EU science, energy, security, training, sustainability, and society. Despite this, research, teaching, and key skills of f-element chemistry are disappearing from universities, but it is essential that knowledge is improved and handed down. There is no coordinated forum for cooperative mobility mechanisms for nationally funded f-element chemists pursuing fundamental frontier research to initiate collaborations, training, networking, and dissemination with each other. This Action  will provide mechanisms to promote such goals by establishing a network linking the EU f-element community in order to invigorate and expand the area. This will enhance the supply routes of trained researchers from universities to industry, restructure the EU science-base, and give research output greater than the sum of its parts.
