  Common ragweed ( Ambrosia artemisiifolia ) is one of the most prominent invasive alien species (IAS) in Europe. Its pollen grains are noxious aeroallergens, it is an important agricultural weed and also occupies large non-crop areas with a range that is likely to accelerate under climate change. As a result, long-term and widely applicable options are required for its sustainable management, as well as the coordination of institutions involved in Ambrosia  research and management throughout Europe. SMARTER will establish an interdisciplinary network including experts currently involved in the control of ragweed, Non-COST key-experts, health care professionals, aerobiologists, economists, and atmospheric and agricultural modellers. SMARTER will provide a forum for discussing long-term management and monitoring options and the development of new innovative management solutions, such as a synergy between biological, physical and chemical control measures and vegetation management, and assess their cost-effectiveness in mitigating the effects of IAS. SMARTER will act as a catalyst for long-term research, provide an information platform and develop best practice manuals for the integrated management of ragweed. It will also help to tackle other IAS, benefit all sectors affected by IAS, promote outstanding R D, innovation in industry and provide support for policy-makers in the European Research Area ( ERA ).
