  This Action  aims to enhance and improve understanding of one of the most disputed and politically-charged consequences of climate change: migration. To do so, it brings together a diverse ensemble of established and early-stage social scientists to build upon and extend existing social science research into climate change and migration across three interrelated fields of investigation: knowledge; law and policy; and theory. The Action  has five objectives: to enhance and improve understanding of climate change and migration; to furnish state and non-state actors with state-of-the-art empirical, theoretical, legal and policy research on climate change and migration; to inform national and international policy dialogue, such as the IPCC and other policy initiatives; to expand research capacity in the area of climate change and migration; and to establish a network of Europe-based social science researchers working on climate change and migration. The beneficiaries of the Action  include states, in particular those of the European Union, as well as environmental, development and humanitarian NGOs, and IGOs, such as UNFCCC, IPCC, UNEP, UNDP, IOM and ILO.  Moreover, by facilitating the development of world-leading social science perspectives on climate change and migration, the Action  aims to enhance development and build adaptive capacity amongst those most vulnerable climate change.
