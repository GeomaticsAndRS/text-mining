  Cyberbullying refers to bullying and harassment of others by means of new electronic technologies, primarily mobile phones and the internet. There has been much research and action on traditional forms of bullying in schools, with some success, but cyberbullying has arisen and increased in the last few years. Researchers, pupils, parents, teachers, unions, and local, regional and national authorities, are all in various ways starting to grapple with the issues involved in cyberbullying, in consultation with mobile phone companies and internet service providers. There are also positive uses of new technologies for relationships in schools; for example, using a school intranet for peer support services. This COST Action  aims at sharing expertise on cyberbullying in educational settings, and coping with negative and enhancing positive uses of new technologies. This will be done across a wide range of COST countries, though Working Groups, three Workshops, a final Conference, and exchange of personnel, especially early career researchers; and involving all the stakeholders listed above.
