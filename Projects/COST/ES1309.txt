  Important European and international initiatives (SPECNET, BIOSPEC and COST Action  ES0903) explored the use of proximal optical sensing of  ecosystem where carbon and water vapor flux is estimated by eddy covariance techniques. Such optical observations provide data at the  high spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions necessary to more fully  comprehend the links between light use, plant physiology and ecosystem  functioning and provide key validation datasets for satellite remote sensing, such as the Sentinel missions, and the flux communities. The recent  advances in UAV platforms and optical sensors provide unprecedented  opportunities for high spatial, spectral and multi-angular near-ground  Earth observations. This will enable scientists to answer ecological and physiological questions at multiple scales through integrated empirical  and modeling methods. Important progress is also being made in remote  sensing of steady-state fluorescence, the most direct proxy for  photosynthesis. The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) mission, selected for further studies, will also benefit as this Action  will support FLEX  validation and calibrations campaigns. Furthermore, scientists have  recognized the need to develop a 'smart' on-line platform to process and analyses optical data along with biophysical and water/carbon flux measurements and share these with other scientific communities and stakeholders which will also be addressed in this Action .
