  Megaprojects are extremely large-scale investment projects that typically cost more than EUR 0.5 billion. Megaprojects are united by their extreme complexity (both in technical and human terms) and by a long record of poor delivery. Their inability to be designed appropriately and delivered on time and to budget has profound implications not only for the construction organisations delivering them but also for the client organisations commissioning them (which are often governments spending public money.) This Action  seeks to bring together multi-disciplinary researchers from across COST Countries  to tackle the issues of megaproject design and delivery. The Action  will produce immediate guidelines to influence practice and a framework to guide future decisions on resourcing EU research in megaproject design and delivery.
