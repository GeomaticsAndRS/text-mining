Aims SESES public domain to the development of new to turn fields and user groups for the simulation of distributed, coupled physico/chemical systems using the method of finite element simulation software development. Specifically, it is to produce one - to the be standing SESES software - flexible Programmpacketes for application-specific needs of developers such as sensors, actuators, fuel cells.
