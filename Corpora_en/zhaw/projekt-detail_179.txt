In a first step, it applies to determine potential users and their needs and expectations to horizon scanning. Not only authorities but also research institutions and companies interested in future developments. The effects, use cases and processes of working with horizon scanning are identified for the various industries. Assuming scanning Web tool can be defined then the functionality as well as the interaction concept for a horizon of the ZHAW.
