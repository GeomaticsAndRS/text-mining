Write as complex cognitive and linguistic task represents a major challenge in particular for vocational school students with an immigrant background. Usually, these are taught until today, however according to guidelines and methods, which are designed for students of German mother tongue. To remedy this situation, promoting the General literacy in vocational schools is developed in the framework of the research project a concept of process-oriented writing didactics, that connects second language didactics (DaZ) given the linguistic heterogeneity of the pupils mother tongue teaching (DaM). The process-oriented approach 'equalized' the writing process and assigns content, as also linguistic-communicative tasks to different stages of the writing process. This relieves the writers and teachers, better to diagnose linguistic deficits at the various stages of the writing process and better promote the development of not yet developed language skills or partial language skills. This is that the (standard) linguistic and communicative skills are already available, but that they must be taught only in preparatory oral phases â€“ according to the principle "from conversation to composition" - as well as in the stages of independent writing and promoted through targeted feedback not assumed as in the mother-tongue teaching. This approach is considered typical for the second language teaching, based on linguistic skills before their communicative performance. To the implementation and evaluation of the didactic concept, pedagogical didactic intervention is intended, their effectiveness by characteristics of the survey of the General professional literacy and other staff hanging (as writing-related self-efficacy, motivation, etc.) in the experimental and control groups at three points in time (pretest-post test-control group design with follow-up measurement) is verified.
