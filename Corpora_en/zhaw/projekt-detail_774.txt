In recent years there has been a continuous increase in subject teaching through the medium of English in non-English speaking areas of education. In ZHAW, there is a lively debate among lecturers and study programme coordinators about the introduction of English as a medium of instruction in certain study contexts. While the complete switch from German to English medium programmes may still be too ambitious, various stakeholders have expressed their interest in extending the range of modules taught through English. In order to do so, they need guidelines that contain information about how challenges can be addressed (entry requirements, language competences) and how English can be gainfully used in study contexts as a medium of instruction. This project aims at developing tips and recommendations for lecturers and course coordinators, drawing particular attention to current practices and experiences in the context of ZHAW. It addresses the following topics: - Challenges of EMI - ZHAW language policy - View of stakeholders - Best practice examples Deliverable: Guidelines (online) Duration: 6 months
