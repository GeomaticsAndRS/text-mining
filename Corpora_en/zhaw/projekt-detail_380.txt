KU Leuven CASCADE will develop a unified control framework for continuum robots that operate in complex and deformable environments. It adopts general mathematical descriptions of the continuum robot and its surroundings, and ways to identify the parameters of these descriptions during operation. In cases where fusing pre-operative data with intra operatively acquired sensor data does not provide sufficient information to allow reliable decision-making, active sensing techniques will be adopted. Furthermore an interface to the supervising surgeon will be foreseen to notify the latter and request for assistance. The same interface will be employed during learning phases and validation of techniques upon well-chosen benchmarks. The resulting development will allow the control of local (interaction force/stiffness) hand global (shape) robot states with unprecedented level of detail. The tools developed in this project will be used to verify the achievable control performance of continuum robots in MIS. In particular they will advance the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) by providing a novel dexterous and intelligent instrument that will be tested on endovascular aortic valve replacement.
