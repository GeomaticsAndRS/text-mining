For many departments at the Institute of biotechnology is the analysis of substrates and metabolites of great importance for the understanding of processes. The Department of measuring and sensor technology provides the infrastructure for an efficient and accurate analysis of these substances. New methods are developed, such as the analysis of amino acids from Insektenzell media or oligosaccharides by fermentation processes.
