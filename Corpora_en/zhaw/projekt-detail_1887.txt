The air hygiene Office of both Basels (LHA, www.baselland.ch) measures the quality of air in the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft since 1977. Currently (2000) 8 permanent air stations (3 SO2, NOx 7, 7 O3, 1 PM10) and two test (2 SO2, NOx 2, 2 O3, 2 PM10) available are the LHA. In addition, additional air monitoring stations are operated by external bodies in the Basel region in the country and abroad. The following questions should be clarified as a decision basis for the reorientation of the measuring network for the years 2001 to 2005:-the stations in the greater region can be divided into groups with similar statistical parameters Basel? What is the difference between the groups? -Are there redundant stations and which stations represent their group best? Essentially, the questions were answered with methods from the cluster analysis. A total of 27 stations with up to eight Jahreskenngr√∂ssen of the year 1999 were as observation units. To check how were clearly the allocation of the measuring stations for each cluster, were two different Clusterverfahren, the hierarchical and the partitionierende, and reviewed the analyses for the meteorologically different sponsorship in 1997. The data structure that is found with the statistical analysis essentially confirmed the suspicions of the air hygiene experts, but revealed new insights into the details.
