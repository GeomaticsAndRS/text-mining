With the energy strategy 2050, the cantons are required to promote renewable energy on their GE bid. However extensive reviews of the sites are required to ensure the sustainability of such developments. The cantons have the possibility the optimal areas as priority areas for wind energy use are out already in advance best to intervene in the development process. Therefore, a site search is required.The site search aims to identify the most suitable for wind energy use areas in the canton of Schwyz in Switzerland. The fitness includes both aspects of cost-effectiveness as well as the environmental and social sustainability.
