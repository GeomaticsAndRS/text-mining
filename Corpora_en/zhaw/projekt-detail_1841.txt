Aim of this project is to test a new optical sensor for its suitability for the sensitive and specific detection of antibody-Antigen interactions. The optical instrument, which was based on surface Refractometry, is a new development of the Swiss Center for electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM Neuch√¢tel). In a beta test, the device of the ZHW would be provided. The work within the project focus E projects on the assessment of the potential of the technology in terms of their use in F.
