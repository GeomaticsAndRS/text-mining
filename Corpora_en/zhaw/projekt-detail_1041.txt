The project aimed to assist the Professional Association physioswiss in establishing a trust Centre for self-employed physiotherapists. For enhancing and inhibiting factors for a successful introduction of the electronic exchange of data were analyzed (Venkata) at other trust centers. In this way should be learned from other trust centers which experiences and mistakes had made other professions/Trust Center and had to overcome what barriers and investigated in advance. Methods: A literature review and were leitfadengestützte expert interviews with representatives from trust centres of other performance heritage ring groups (E.g. doctors, pharmacists), associations and ÄrztInnennetzwerken performed. The expert survey took place in the form of approximately one-hour phone interviews from October until December 2009. Results: Enhancing factor is the introduction of a new tariff system for the doctors in the Center. With eDA the doctors wanted to create an own data base, to track the cost neutrality and the development of the settlement. Also the solidarity of among the members played an important role, as the positive added value for the members of the Trust Center, to link their data with other performance heritage ring groups as well as the reduction of administrative expenses. Inhibiting factors are the poker of high expectations and false promises in terms of effort, too high or "disguised" costs and an imperceptible benefits, as well as uncertainties in the data security when exchanging electronic data. It is planned that apply for physioswiss and ZHAW for the further development of eDA subsidy funds to the Commission for technology and innovation (CTI). Also the project results to an article are reprocessed and published in a scientific journal, E.g. in "Care Management". The project was successfully completed.
