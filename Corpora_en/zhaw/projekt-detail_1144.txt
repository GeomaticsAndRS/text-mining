Ion-selective electrodes are used daily in many routine applications (E.g., clinical chemistry, environmental analysis). Thanks to the development of new components (E.g. Ionophore), the range of these sensors increases continuously. In the Department of measuring and sensor technology, such sensor components on behalf of an industry partner in an automated procedures are tested and characterized.
