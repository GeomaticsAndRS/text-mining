A Bachelor's thesis performed at the ZHAW 2009 has shown that neophytes on the recently renatured sections of the river Thur were significantly more common than on the not renaturierten: on the structurally "very much 20% of the surface compared to 4.5% and 2.5% on the only"strong"or"slightly"altered surfaces modified sections occupied neophytes. The main objective of the proposed project is to clarify whether the Thur is a special case, or whether the findings there also apply to other restored River sections in the Switzerland. This should allow us to capture the national dimension of the problem. In particular, the following questions should be answered: • are more often than not renatured to invasive neophytes renatured River sections? • The difference between restored and non restored Flusabschnitte in relation to the composition of the neophyte flora? • From what altitude invasive neophytes on riverbanks are currently still irrelevant? Keywords. River revitalization, neophytes, monitoring, problem plants
