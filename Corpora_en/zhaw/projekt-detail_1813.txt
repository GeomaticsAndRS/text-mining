In this project, students found a simulated company and market a product or service of their choice. They participate in an international case study involving commercial correspondence and other forms of communication, in English, with companies from other countries. In the process, they become aware of cultural differences and learn to communicate more effectively in international business contexts. The project promotes the development of new tools and methods for training language and intercultural competencies and improving the intercultural communication skills and sensibility of the learners. As such, it promotes acquisition of linguistic and other skills necessary to facilitate mobility within the global labour market. The project has its own website, where some of the transactions between international partners can be viewed.
