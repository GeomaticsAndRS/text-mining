Household appliances deals with technical and physical issues within the area of housekeeping. By visiting the module, students are enabled to understand the functions and components of household appliances and to understand the physical and chemical processes and to explain. An online task tool for the module home appliances will be developed within the framework of the cooperation agreement between the ZHAW and the University of Bonn. The task tool is used at the ZHAW in the course of facility management and at the University of Bonn in the study course Oecotrophology. The learning tool home appliances is an online task tool based on the E-learning software ItkA!. In a first step, specific task models were developed to achieve high-quality tasks. 1500 items were collected and catalogued. These are now transferred into the system of task models and the software-specific database. In addition, the tasks with multimedia materials are enriched. Finally, the prototype is tested and evaluated with a qualitative survey. The learning tool is already used as a prototype in the classroom and should be completed by the end of 2008. Aim is to develop of a comprehensive learning scenarios, sustainably and in addition can be used to the traditional lecture.
