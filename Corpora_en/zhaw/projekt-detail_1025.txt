The green waste contained substantial organic components can be insufficiently connected in a conventional biogas plant. Improving promises the physico chemical pretreatment, which mechanically includes the substrates and can be expected to a higher energy yield. There are also tools such as trace elements and enzymes, which should increase the yield even to difficult substrates to the multiple according to manufacturer's instructions. Due to lack of neutral information consumers and operators rely so far on the statements of the provider. It is the potential to increase the yield of certain additives, chemical and physical treatment or the combination on each other tuned co substrates investigated and independently evaluated. The study is funded by the Swiss Federal Office of energy (SFOE).
