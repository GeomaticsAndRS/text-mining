Mobile Cloud Networking is Mobile Network + Decentralised Computing + Smart Storage offered as One Service On-Demand, Elastic and Pay-As-You-Go. The top-level objectives of the Mobile Cloud Networking project are a) to develop a novel mobile network architecture and technologies, using proof-of-concept prototypes, to lead the way from current mobile networks to a fully cloud-based mobile communication system, and b) to extend cloud computing so as to support on-demand and elastic provisioning of novel mobile services. Mobile Cloud Networking will investigate, implement, and evaluate the technological foundations for that system. It will meet real-time performance needs, support efficient and elastic use and sharing of both radio access and mobile core network resources between operators. Mobile network functionalities such as baseband unit processing, mobility management and QoS control will run on the enhanced mobile cloud platform leveraging commodity hardware. This requires extensions towards higher decentralisation and enhancing those functionalities to elastically scale up and down based on load. The end-to-end control and management orchestrates infrastructure and services across several technological domains: wireless, mobile core and data centres, providing guaranteed end-to-end SLAs and AAA as well as service mobility through the Follow-Me Cloud concept. Besides the technological aspects, Mobile Cloud Networking will identify and evaluate overarching novel business models that support the exploitation of the mobile cloud in various multi-stakeholder scenarios. The Mobile Cloud Networking architecture will be evaluated in realistic scenarios and with a set of concrete use-cases, based on applications such as mobile cloud enabled digital signage. The evaluation will be done from diverse viewpoints, exploiting the well-balanced and representative consortium, including leading industry from the telecommunication as well as the cloud computing segments.
