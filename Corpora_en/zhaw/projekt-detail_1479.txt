This project aims to improve the understanding of the expression, preparative manufacturing, cleaning, and handling (solubility, stability, functionality) membrane proteins, especially of ion channels. The focus of the project will be the production of proteins of the human ether-a-gogo (hERG) potassium channel. The focus is initially on the identification or establishment of an efficient expression system for recombinant protein in a quality and quantity is obtained which enables the use of protein crystallization, but also for the study of protein/ligand interactions using biophysical methods.
