Automatic front couplings of passenger trains must absorb all of the energy liberated up to an impact velocity of 10 km/h. The impact may not be damaged the couplings, or accelerated the car too much. For the passenger trains in the number of cars and their masses differ, the damper built into the couplings must be adapted to the respective load. Optimum adaptation is hardly feasible without simulation. Have been drawn up for the following passenger trains first simulation studies: Lake Valley Railway, Thurbo, flirt, ZÃ¼richs S-Bahn.
