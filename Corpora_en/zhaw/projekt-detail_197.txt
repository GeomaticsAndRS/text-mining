SAS Switzerland the ZHAW is in the study of data scientists budding computer science and industrial engineering as well as data warehousing (DWH) / business intelligence (BI) specialists from. Appropriate courses need an efficient IT infrastructure (hardware and software) for the implementation of course-related internships. In the generation of current, practical, and at the same time not overly complex problems including records, construction and maintenance of laboratory server, as well as in the operation of the complex software infrastructure (databases, OLAP systems, tools, etc.) flows each year much effort on the part of the teachers and of the; Construction of means of. Aim of this project is an internally fully usable prototype (proof of concept) for the development and sustainable operation of a Switzerland-wide teaching and learning practice platform for DWH BI technologies based on a SAS software solution to the training of future data scientists at Swiss universities. The proof-of-concept platform is equipped with complete elaborate learning and Ãœbungsmaterialen, including data banks containing sample data and instructions/tasks to solve specific issues. In the first step the platform is information engineering E used in the focus directly for rates at the ZHAW (E.g. "DAB" or "DSSY"), as well as for F. After successful evaluation phase the platform can be provided selected universities, so that the user experiences can flow directly into the proof-of-concept.
