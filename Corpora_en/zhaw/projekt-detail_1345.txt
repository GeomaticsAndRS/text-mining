Federal chemical sensors used for Metrology METAS, Bern in clinical analysis routinely to determine of electrolytes and glucose in blood or blood plasma. Enter here the activity of an analyte, so its freely available and thus biologically relevant share. In contrast, the total concentration of the analyte is determined with conventional instruments. In cooperation with the Federal Office of Metrology (METAS), the measurement using potentiometric ion selective electrodes (ISEs) and enzymatic amperometric glucose biosensors under the microscope is included in the project. In the foreground are applications in clinical chemistry. Within the framework of the project, the following issues are examined: * optimization of chemical sensors for precise measurements * procedures for the calibration in the physiological range * quantification of the uncertainty of measurement * comparability and traceability of measurements with chemical sensors
