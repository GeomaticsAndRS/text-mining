3D printed medical implants based on CT-scans lead to personalized bone tissue regeneration therapies Medical materials made from biodegradable drug-polymer-composites will be the key raw material for the 3D printing process. The controlled drug release through biodegradation defined by the implant's composite, geometry and structure will optimally support the bone tissue regeneration in the patient.
