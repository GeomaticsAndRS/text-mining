The environmental biotechnology of the ZHAW as a project partner of Ernst Basler partner group developed a material flow analysis model with which different scenarios concerning the biomass and nutrient flows (nitrogen and phosphorus) can be mapped and analyzed for the Federal Office for the environment (FOEN). The relationships and the most important influencing factors on scenario analyses are made visible by means of a sensitivity analysis and corresponding adjustment of transfer coefficients in the model.
