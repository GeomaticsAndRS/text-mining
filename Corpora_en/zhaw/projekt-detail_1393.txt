In patients with chronic respiratory lung disease (COPD), the goal of physical therapy is a Verbesserunug of performance, a normalization of the breathing peace situation and an improvement of the vital capacity. Biofeedback is used to support the physiotherapy. This treatment should be evaluated. Methods: Randomized controlled trial. All patients were discussed in depth in a 3-week rehabilitation programme. In addition, in the experimental group, the treatment is supported with biofeedback. Biofeedback is derived from the heart rate variability, the activity of the respiratory muscles, blood gas values, or breathing gas values. Examined out comes are the influence of the biofeedback on the maximum walking distance (6 minutes), then Dypnoe and fatigue, breathing stop position during a stress test and heart rate variability. The project was successfully completed.
