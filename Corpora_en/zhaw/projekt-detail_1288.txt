This study evaluated the current scientific status of complaint validierungstests (BAT). The study tests were critically assessed with regard to their validity and test their application in practice of social insurance and accident insurance. The results of this study will serve as a basis for the discussion about the evaluation procedures in the IV and for an improved implementation of bat in the clarification process and when creating the social opinion. Also, the results in other domains, which are also involved in the assessment of insurance-related complaints, should be transferred. The results of this study are controversial at first glance: in the literature, the scientific validity spoken to many validation tests, experts and experts in practice, however, there is great skepticism. A second look gives a more nuanced picture. The literature draws attention to some problems in the scientific review of the tests used in the German-speaking world: so the "malingerers" in scientific test checks typically are "actress" students z.Bsp. Also made any comparisons between investigations with bat, or without a bat. Furthermore, individual tests exhibit a low specificity, that is, they "convict" peer-reviewed people simulation on suspicion of what cannot be carried out incorrectly. Also shows that many of the requested experts and experts with tests work, but more often with not scientifically tested. Connectify can be determined, that both the scientific literature and the practice as central highlight, that the complaint validation tests may be only complementary used to professionally qualified clinical examination by experienced technical specialists and specialists.
