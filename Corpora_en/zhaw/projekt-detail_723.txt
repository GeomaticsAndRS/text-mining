The canton of Zurich has merged the 182 hunting grounds, which are supported and often small and arbitrarily defined from a wild animal biological perspective on political boundaries, 2011 15 larger units - the wild spaces -. Under wild areas Habitat units to understand that are against each other distinguish itself due to natural and anthropogenic obstacles of spread of (E.g. larger rivers, highways, railways, etc.). This definition is based on the assumption that wildlife within the individual wild areas move largely unhindered. Train of Planning Department cross-wild spaces have arisen two questions: are 1 in designing hunting for the deer to leave the used parameters and basis of calculation or to adapt? 2.wie can be changed to the existing planning processes to the newly defined wild spaces and then again on the grounds? This opinion has aims to answer these questions and to show the processes in selected methodically comprehensible. It creates a launch planning model that relies on type-specific biological characteristics and population dynamic parameters.
