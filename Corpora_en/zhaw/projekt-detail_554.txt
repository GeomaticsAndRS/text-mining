Background: More and more people working in the service sector and thus pursue a mostly sedentary activity. There is evidence that a mostly sedentary activity leads to increased back pain. The back pain seem caused among other things by the static load of the structures of the back to be. There are various Office furniture manufacturers to bring different approaches to more comfort in everyday seat. In particular the dynamic approach of a moving seat to the mobilization of the musculo-skeletal system has prevailed in recent years. In addition, the individual setting options in the context of a possible ergonomic sitting has further developed. A novel dynamic Office Chair is considered in this work, which enables a continuous, active movement. Objective: Study and development of dynamic seating concept. Method: In a preliminary study the lateral oscillation of the basin is simulated, which should serve the development of a prototype of the dynamic Chair. The new developed Chair is then compared in a second step with earlier prototypes and the preliminary measurements. Is the movement of the back is influenced by different concepts of Chair? The movement of the back is measured in the movement laboratory of the Institute of physiotherapy, which used the 3D motion analysis. The project was successfully completed.
