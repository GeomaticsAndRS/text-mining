The LASSO project was carried out under the cooperation of the University Hospital of Zurich, as well as five institutes of the ETH (LASSO: laparoscopic surgery simulator). The ZHW has realized an input device conceived and a prototype for this project. The input-device consists of a laparoskopischem button bar with force feedback and a camera unit. Both are built in a torso. A building with an artificial skin and surgery cloths cause a lifelike appearance. The force feedback allows the surgeon to feel the simulated organs close to reality.
