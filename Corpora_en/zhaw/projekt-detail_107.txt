Agroscope species-rich habitats in agricultural landscapes have fallen sharply in recent decades. To show the change of biodiversity in the open cultivated land and to evaluate the ecological measures of the Federal Government, the FOAG in collaboration with the FOEN initiated the project of ALL-EMA (species and habitats Agriculture Esp√®ces et aquatic agricoles). Statistically validated data to answer practice-relevant research questions can be delivered with the monitoring of species and habitats of the environmental objectives developed specifically for this project agriculture (UZL) for the total utilised agricultural area. The vegetation analysis research group edited the study area in the Eastern Central Alps. The survey cycle extends over 5 years (2015-2019).
