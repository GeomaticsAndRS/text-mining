On the basis of a qualitative investigation system, older inmates and law enforcement employees of penitentiary concordats of Eastern Switzerland and the North-Western and inner Switzerland, will be interviewed in a second step. The analysis of point of view and ways of experiencing these two target groups is important to capture the subject from different perspectives. The aim of the project is to better knowledge of the specific pressures of the older inmates and the specific challenges facing law enforcement personnel in the support of the target group is faced to win. The study will provide bases to carry out a needs - and problem-oriented planning of full courses for the elderly in the Swiss criminal law and enforcement.
