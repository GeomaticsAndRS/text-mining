This project defines a domain-oriented software development method for embedded systems. This method includes partial methods for the construction of functional components for their embedding on the target system and for the specification of the version control. We developed a new method for embedding functional components based on interaction pattern. The overall method is supported by a newly developed specification tool, with which the application of the methods of the part can be kept consistent.
