This project aims at contributing to a better understanding of the relation of media content on the one side and audience perception and reaction on the other, particularly for Africa, where media assistance is mainly targeting the process of democratization. The projectÂs objective is to gain data, knowledge of and insight into the quality of media and their effects in the public arena and as a possible contributor towards democratization processes on a micro level. On the one hand the quality of content of informational radio programs will be measured, using quantitative content analysis. On the other hand the audience reactions will be analyzed in focus group discussions with selected groups of representatives of society. The case of Liberia will be used as a case study: Liberia is a prime example reflecting a country in the process of building up democratic institutions, where media are supposed to contribute to this process. The results gained by the close examination of this country will to some extent be transferable to other countries.
