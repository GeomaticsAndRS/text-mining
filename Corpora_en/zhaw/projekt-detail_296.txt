The speed-YES (planar-YES) concept is a conceptual innovation, compared to the organic tests on the market today because a) the separation of the samples analyzed, unlike all other conventional bioassays, before the estrogenen activity is measured, and b) HPTLC plates instead of microtiter plates are used. The previous level of development gives rise to the hope that a preventive screening of water samples in the future with this concept is easier. For drinking water supplies would be especially interesting if to avoid the time-consuming step of the extraction. There is also the potential interface to the chemical analysis of great interest. With the proposed project the speed YES applied concept was first viewed as problematic, some raw water samples. In addition to the clean-up are step further elaborated and tested with raw water samples.
