Heat pumps are the most common heat generator in new buildings in the Switzerland. More heat pumps are installed in existing buildings. The 4-year project aims at reducing the power consumption of heat pumps with borehole heat exchangers. The COP is to be increased when compared to the today's State of the art by 20 percent. In the light of the many facilities and the forecasts that until about 20 years in hundreds of thousands of other such facilities are created, this is of great importance.
