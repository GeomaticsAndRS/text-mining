Geographic information systems (GIS) are systems that can analyze and manage spatial data. GIS is important for a school of the size of ZHW, because GIS is a standard tool and it is essential for exchanging data with other institutes and private planning offices. Thanks to the partnership of zsa-ZHW at the ESRI site license uni Zurich the ZHW has access to state of the art GIS software and GIS eLearning environment ESRI virtual campus. A platform is created with GIS@ZHW, which access to ArcGIS and ESRI virtual campus gives all members of the ZHW for study or research purposes. GIS@ZHW is coordinated by the Institute for sustainable development (INE). The GIS skills by INE school are offered.
