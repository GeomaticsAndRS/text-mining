Pseudomonas syringae is an important pathogen causing significant damage to a wide variety of plant species including fruit trees of economic significance to Latvia and Switzerland. Diagnosis at species level is based on biochemical and phenotypic characterization including pathogenicity tests on plants; however allocation to a specific pathovar is often established only on the basis of the host from which the bacteria were retrieved, an approach that oversees the possibility of strains being serendipitously co-isolated or having a variable host-range. Recently, P. syringae has become an important threat to Latvian fruit production in orchards and gardens and was found to attack new hosts of emerging economic value such as sea buckthorn. This project aims at the molecular characterization of the pathogenicity determinants in a collection of P. syringae originating from different hosts to identify the range of P. syringae pathovars that is currently present in Latvia and understand their pathogenic potential toward the plant species existing in that country. This project will also offer important insights on population ecology, virulence genetics and evolution of this versatile pathogen.
