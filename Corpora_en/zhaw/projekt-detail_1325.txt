The Accelerom AG is planning a relaunch of its Internet presence. The existing Web site is not alive and text-heavy. New on the Web to convey more emotion and fresh, at the same time but also serious work. A technical revision of Web pages is necessary. The standards such as search engine information (meta tags) or valid code not included (quasi). It is also so far not possible to make text changes, even the employees of Accelerom AG. For this reason the new Internet presence should be adopted a content management system (CMS). The decision was made on the open source CMS Typo3. The software is royalty-free available, offers a wide range of features and expansion capabilities and is also easy and intuitive to use. Of the Zurich University of applied sciences, school of management and law, the Accelerom AG wants support for the implementation.
