On the subject of strategic management in the healthcare sector reference is made today only rarely, and then often only implicitly, on non-medical services, although the provision of 30-40 causes % of costs in hospitals. In doing so, strategic considerations, ostensibly related to the core business, have far-reaching implications on the support area and therefore on the quality as well as direct and indirect costs. How affect strategic decisions on non-medical support services, and strategic requirements must be met to achieve an effective and efficient operational implementation in this area was as yet little to not explored and documented. The think tank "FM in Healthcare" - consisting of the Association has fmpro, various hospital and economic partners, and the Institute for facility management of the Zurich University of applied sciences - in terms of a systematic development of FM services and their impact on the core business of this subject accepted. On the basis of the "performance allocation model for non-medical support services in hospitals" links between the strategic, tactical and operational levels on the basis of existing good were transferred to practice approaches in the medical field in health care, as well as from other sectors in the context of the non-medical support services in hospitals. The instructions derived according to should make visible the qualitative and economic links between strategic, tactical and operational non-medical services the competent in health care in the form of a data sheet collection and show the possibilities for tuning of each layer.
