Needs assessments are a key tool for production and inventory planning. Stochastic models for the ordering process are necessary. For a work of Georg Fischer piping systems AG products, such a model has been developed and tested. Not the usual period-related procedure was used for the characterization of the requirements process, but the ordering process was modeled as a result by stochastically arriving single orders (compound Poisson process). Thus, it is possible to describe articles with high needs as well as those with sporadic needs. To estimate the model parameters, a forecast of any future area is possible while specifying the scope of a trust. The model was tested on the whole range of work. It became evident that the demand for some products was strongly distorted by individual large customer's orders. After removal of the effect of these large customers (which arguably should be observed with non-statistical methods), the model provided a correct description of the required process for 90-97% of the products.
