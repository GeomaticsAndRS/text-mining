We have inventoried all man-caused potential sources of food for bears in the pilot project "Implementation of the FOEN waste in the Val MÃ¼stair". These are designed depending on their location and their attractiveness bear safely. To prevent the habituation to humans in other possible bear regions. From the findings of the pilot project we therefore develop a method for the implementation of the FOEN-waste concept without the costly inventory. In addition, we create a documentation of "Bear prevention", which serves as a practice aid responsible and decision makers.
