It repeatedly are undesirable flavor or active ingredient loss in the production of coagulation in filtration of blood plasma, due to the surface charge of the used filter medium (FHM) ...die Schneider Umwelttechnik AG, Winterthur during the coming process filtration of drinks/food, chemical, pharmaceutical and bio technological products. So far the FHM have been characterized more... Permability, particle size, bulk density, the parameters and not on the basis of electrostatic adsorption properties. Systematically, in the framework of the planned project, various filter tools such as Kieselguren, perlite and Celluloses (incl. nanofibrillierten Celluloses) will be examined and documented on her Zeta potential. Thus one or more FHM for the respective filtration task would grouped together a targeted selection possible and thus a better filtration with either improved filtration performance, less loss of active ingredient, higher yield - with lower filtration costs - possible.
