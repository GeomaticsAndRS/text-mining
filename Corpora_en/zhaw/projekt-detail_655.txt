CEDAM group is responsible for 12 years, not directly recognised postage revenue yield to divorce (exclusive PP) to carry on the business areas and services with. CEDAM determines the "proportion key" for the distribution of quarterly income by means of a stratified sample in the processing process. This sample design was chosen to obtain as precise point estimates for a given sample size (or budget). The stratification of the population offers more options for evaluating data, which go beyond the present order of CEDAM and examples presented in this document and will be discussed. The possibilities of the existing sampling procedure are divided along three dimensions. First, it is also possible to carry broadcasts in processing quarterly proportion representations of the number next to the illustration of the relative income. Second, the sample design allows evaluations at lower levels of aggregation (i.e. "Product groups"). Third principle absolute yields and number can be assigned from broadcasts. The consistent estimation of the absolute sizes is more dependent on the precision of the projection sizes of logistics centres, as is the case with the representations of the proportion. The illustration facilities of CEDAM sample data are examples with quarterly data for the year of 2011 the channels ' letters domestic "and" letters abroad "presented.
