PD are localised electrical discharges that do not lead to a global roll-over. They occur under high electric fields that prevail in the high-voltage devices. Typically, partial discharges are undesirable because they lead to a rapid aging of the equipment and a premature failure. Partial discharges can be measured by special instruments. Analysis of so measured so-called partial discharge patterns can be made statements about the nature of the discharge (void discharge, corona discharge, surface discharge). In the a new statistical analysis method developed this project, which allows to derive conclusions about the physical parameters of the discharge from the measurements.
