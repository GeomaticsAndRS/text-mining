STA. Maria is located in the municipality of Val MÃ¼stair GR on a main connecting axis between the Engadine and the South Tyrol. The cantonal main road crosses the narrow village is greatly complicated the passage due to the limited space available. Now, a bypass around the village of STA is supposed to resolve the traffic bottleneck. Maria will be realized. The ring road is planned South of the village, so that the connection of the cantonal road to the Umbrailpass can be integrated. An environmental impact assessment must be carried out for the project. For the environmental risk assessment, the critical points will be shown and prepared inputs for the project. The preliminary study of the environmental impact report together with the Engineering Office Edy Toscano AG shall be continued.
