A comprehensive federal soil strategy will be developed. So that appropriate objectives and measures can be derived, a fact sheet will be developed initially for each function of soil and land use, as well as the soil properties. The fact sheets you want to show the developments, the current situation, the trends, the threats and conflicts with other soil functions or uses. Because the human resources of the Office for the preparation of fact sheets are not enough external help is needed. The ZHAW is commissioned to create the fact sheets for the soil properties, the control, the production function and the Habitat functions (a total of 4 fact sheets).
