The section of governance of the Swiss Agency for development and cooperation (SDC) creates guidelines for the support of media in developing and transition countries. The Institute for applied media science (IAM) was commissioned to assist the Division in establishing and to bring media-scientific expertise and project experience in these guidelines. In addition, grids and checklists for the analysis of media sectors and the implementation of the project be elaborated. The project was completed in June 2006.
