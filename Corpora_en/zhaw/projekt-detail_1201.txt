The technique of the melodic instrument sound generation plays a prominent role during training, as well as in the later practice of proficient. The sovereign mastery of sound requires a most conscious and active control of sound production-relevant muscle groups of musicians in addition to a sophisticated hearing. The planned study examines music movements and muscle Tonisierungen playing the clarinet using the electromyography (measuring electrical activity of nerves to muscles). You correlate these physiological data on the one hand with objective, computer-based analysis of the generated sound (PRISM analysis), on the other hand with the sub jective aesthetic judgment of listeners.
