SBB cargo freight are constantly making decisions in the capacity management. This on the one hand at the strategic level of the car dimensions (horizon 18 months), and on the other hand at the operational level of the short-term demand and availability prediction (horizon work 10days). With statistical methods, models were developed to produce accurate predictions for the operational and strategic capacity management. These models were implemented software in a semi automatic prototype and are operated daily. A coherent performance evaluation of the accuracy of prediction is performed on the generated results. As an exception reporting built system, which reports the car managers critical capacity bottlenecks in the operational area.
