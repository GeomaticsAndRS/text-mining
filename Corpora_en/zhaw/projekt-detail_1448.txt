In this project, the Sudan oriented website and discussion forum gurtong.org is evaluated. The Gurtong Peace Project is an independent, not-for-profit, community-based project which aims to remove ethnic, political and personal obstacles blocking the development of unity, peace, and mutual respect among Southern Sudanese. It seeks to establish a Southern Sudanese Diaspora coalition with a view to promoting peace and stability among Southern Sudanese abroad as well as within Sudan. A major component of the Gurtong Peace Project is its website and related discussion Forum. This evaluation is carried out for the Department of Foreign affairs of the Swiss federal government, who is partly financing the Gurtong Peace Project. The project consist of a general qualitative review and two quantitative analyses, one which assesses the content of the website and the discussion forum and one which identifies the technical performance of the website. A research team of media in international cooperation (MIC) of the Institute of Applied Media Studies is in charge of the quantitative content analysis.
