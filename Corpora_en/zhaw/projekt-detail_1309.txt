The capercaillie is the largest of our four types of rough foot chicken. Although the capercaillie is a generally well studied species, reliable information about the Habitat needs of hens are missing during the period of breeding and rearing of the hatchlings. A reproduction successful over longer periods of is of central importance for the conservation of the species. We want to close this gap with our project.
