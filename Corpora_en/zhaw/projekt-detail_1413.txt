The conflict journalism examines mass media in Liberia - a country located after 14 years of armed clashes since 2003 in the reconstruction project. This project investigates selected programmes of local radio stations in Liberia, as well as articles in various newspapers in terms of care, how conflicts are presented. Thus it should be how different journalism concepts to the representation of conflict (peace journalism, conflict sensitive journalism, objective journalism) are implemented in practice and which messages and narratives are provided to users charged empirically. This evidence suggests that mass media can help to overcome past conflicts and prevent future violent confrontations.
