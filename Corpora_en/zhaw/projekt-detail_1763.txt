This FUNalpin module provides the basis for the development of an indicator-based certification process for support worthy label regions, who wish to undertake a sustainable regional development. An integral objective and indicator set for the three dimensions of society, the environment and the economy is in a special way for the implementation of the concept of sustainable development. Indicators can represent such as spatial and socio-economically relevant facts. Therefore, indicators are an important planning instrument of spatial planning, particularly in national and regional planning. However, the congruence between desirable and reasonably measurable indicators represents a challenge. Often lack the necessary data base. The validity of an indicator must be critically ever again. Because sustainable development is a procedural and changeable character, indicator systems running is to adapt to changing needs and issues.
