The professorship in organizational communication and public of the IAM Institute of applied media science (Prof. Dr. Peter Santos Herlach) supported the German Swiss Conference of cantonal education (D-EDK) in the evaluation of the text of the new curriculum of 21 for the elementary school. This is done in collaboration with the Centre for specialised communication and terminology of the Department of applied linguistics of the ZHAW. The suitability of the text for the public communication especially between education authorities and teachers (text design) will be checked. Since autumn 2010 curriculum 21 were drawn up, probably in the autumn of 2014 it to pass the cantons to introduce. With the curriculum of 21, the cantons implement article 62 of the Constitution, which requires harmonization of the objectives of the school. All 21 German and multilingual cantons are involved in the project.
