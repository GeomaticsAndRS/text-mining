In the large-scale reform of commercial training (RKG) created different expertise to the project team and worked with professional groups, to review the performance objectives in the various strands of the commercial apprenticeship or professional certificate in business. Throughout the common European framework of reference for languages was used as the main instrument. Another product of the work is an accreditation concept, using the international language diplomas of the commercial apprenticeship may be credited. We continuously support the implementation of the reform with training and consulting.
