The electronic documentation of the care process is an integral part of the practice today in many hospitals. However, still no studies that exist, how different electronic systems support the nurses in their work. This also applies to the theory-guided, interactive system "Pflegis", that is for a few months in various departments of the Zurich city hospital Triemli in use. Now, a joint project of Triemlispitals and the Institute investigates care of the Zurich University of applied sciences of the question to what extent the system of "Pflegis" supports employees in the implementation of the care process. The project wants to answer questions about the individual capture of the needs of patients, diagnoses, statements of objectives and maintenance measures. Also to be evaluated, what system elements is the most used by "Pflegis" by the nurses.
