In the Capturing Translation Processes (CTP) project1, we are monitoring student and professional translators at various points in their careers. The data allow comparisons between the same students at the beginning of their translation degree program, the end, and 2 years post-graduation as junior professionals as well as professionals with different levels of experience. The statistical analysis is done at the IDP while Maureen Ehrensberger-Dow at Dept L has the lead of project.
