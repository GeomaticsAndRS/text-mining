The primary purpose of this study was to examine and compare motivation for language learning in Swiss, Japanese, and Asian- and Euro-Canadian learners in order to better understand cultural variations in the psychological mechanisms underlying motivated action. A total of almost 250 ZHW students studying English completed a questionnaire(written in German or English) about their motivation for learning the language. Two ZHW graduates served as research assistants to process the data. The results of this study are expected to illuminate how learners & 039; intrinsic motivation is supported in different ways depending upon the cultural context. Such information could contribute to the development of more culturally appropriate language teaching programs and strategies.
