Virtamed VirtaMed develops and produces surgery simulators that are very realistic, but also complicated and expensive. Therefore, these simulators are used mainly in large Aubildungszentren. So that more doctors can take advantage of the simulator training, in this project, a simplified Simulator combined with an E-learning system, and designed a low-cost input device. Thus, the training on any computer, as well as with an innovative billing model (E.g. pay-per-use) will be allowed. Cooperation partner: Inst. for Mechatronics, ZHAW-IMS, Dept.
