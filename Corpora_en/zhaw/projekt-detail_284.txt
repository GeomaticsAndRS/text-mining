Customize the temporally varying energy of production Research Centre to ABB, it requires large energy stores, which currently mainly limited to the pumped storage. These are no longer sufficient in the future, to cache the increasing, fluctuating energy from photovoltaic systems and wind power plants. To cover production peaks, the chemical storage in the form of batteries provide a possible alternative. In its compact form, they can be installed locally and improve the integration of the new renewable energies. Decentralized energy storage optimally in the network to integrate these, it needs new intelligent distribution network control systems, which control these stores on the basis of current and pr√§dizierten conditions (weather, power consumption and generation, electricity, etc.). This project is developing new algorithms for the battery system and its optimal size.
