Single-use biogas reactors play an increasingly important role in the biotechnological production (especially in cell cultures). Online analysis of critical metrics (E.g., pH and dissolved oxygen) can be applied easily by conventional bio-reactors and is still a challenge in single-use systems. At the same time offer this new production process as well as opportunities for new measuring principles. In the project, sensor systems for the application in single-use organic rektoren are optimized and tested in cell cultures. A focus on impedance spectroscopic measurements that allow inference on the cell density and vitality.
