The aim of the OPTIMISM-project is to develop different sets of strategies and methodologies for optimising passenger transport systems based on co-modality ICT solutions. Towards this goal, OPTIMISM will consider passenger needs and the carbon-neutral objective. OPTIMISMâs main scope is to provide a scientifically documented insight of the transport systems and peopleâs travel choices via the study of social behaviour, mobility patterns and business models. This insight will help in identifying future changes in the passenger travel systems that lead to more sustainable methods or modes of travelling, by helping people to travel in a more efficient, safer and cleaner way, without compromising mobility.
