Andermatt is a small mountain village with rather modest tourism, that served in the past as a key location of the Swiss army. This brought jobs and economic stability the village for a century. The army has largely withdrawn from Andermatt and a large part of the area is now massively expanded hotels development (OHD) as tourist center by the Egyptian Samih Sawiris of Orascom investor. The construction of this tameness to more and more demanding guests in the village will be, on the other hand also an immigration of workers is to be expected. This is an opportunity for development, which can be used by the local population and the company in a sustainable manner for the entire region. The project "Site potential ursern Valley" aims at a win-win situation with the resort that's why: * outside the resort an attractive additional offer (natural and cultural sites, services) developed for the guests * residents can participate through private entrepreneurship in the value-added of large investment with the increase of tourists in the region economic development potentials. But not only in the field of tourism coming changes on the region, also in the area of living and working in the ursern Valley, new possibilities arise. It is also these opportunities, to exploit them commercially. Creative ideas for the implementation of new employment niches are to generate and a co-ordinated and use synergies implementation is to strive for. This requires an in-depth qualitative analysis and a participatory development process.
