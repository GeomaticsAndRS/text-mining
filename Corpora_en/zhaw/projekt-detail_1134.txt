The ILP is quite established as a management instrument at the Department N, but was supported but technically only unsatisfactory in recent years. On the one hand, the available Excel sheets for users were not just easy to use and clearly, on the other hand were summary reports on level Institute as well as on level Department with the information distributed to multiple Excel files only with a huge overhead, or not possible at all. The complex, inflexible and distributed on two versions of Excel ILP should be replaced by an easy to use, easy to use forms-based database application. The database should allow ILPs with a variable, tailored to the needs of individual job detail level and increase the value of the ILP as a management tool. With a central data bank to collect all of the ILP data in one place, so that no additional effort is necessary to merge the data for data consolidation level Institute and Department. Institute Director should receive the evaluations necessary for their field on push of a button. The ILP data versioned to can be stored, so that at any time on level Institute as well as on level Department what if analyses are possible, without overwriting current ILPs.
