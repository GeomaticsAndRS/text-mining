In the framework of a pilot project the ZHAW commissioned School of management and law (SML), to evaluate whether data mining generally comes in question for a specific question relating to retail trade and to develop first models. The Center for WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK (Zvi) of August has done this work until December 2009 with following results: the relevant quality values are too low for both developed models to assume the correctness of the models and to be able to work with them. This is in particular due to the fact that the number of inputs considered in relation to the identified factors was too low. Based on these results, the ZHAW was commissioned, carry out a census of all input factors influence factors and to develop based on new data mining models for the success of one of these input factors.
