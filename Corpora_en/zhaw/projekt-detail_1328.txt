Bone defects in the dental sector triggered by accidents, periodontal disease, cysts, and tumors. The bone structure is today by filling of the defect with bone graft substitute, in which blood vessels and osteoblasts migrate, resulting in the formation of bone. This regeneration can be improved by covering the bone replacement material with a collagen membrane. The collagen membrane prevents that fast-growing soft tissue takes the place of the slow-growing bone. The aim of the project is to produce a Functionalized collagen membrane, which further improves the regeneration of the bone defect.
