Pilot study: It is likely that since the legislation apparently engineered, the requirements for the classification and delineation of wines (E.g. after their regional origins) will intensify in the next few years. Sensors panels fulfill this claim does not necessarily satisfying, and their results are often doubted. We are looking for a more objective way. The application of multivariate clustering algorithms and classifier, developed on the IAS (Isingtron, cf. transfer 2/2009), on IR spectra appears to us as a promising method. This must still be proven. A new FT/IR device does currently at the beverage and flavor Research Centre. Thus a suitable set of IR spectra of suitable wines is to be measured, which then the potential of different Diskriminanzverfahren (state-of-the-art methods of machine learning and statistics) should be explored.
