The capacity of different units is planned within the framework of the new building of a hospital. Depending on the size and model of the operator are different costs (fixed and variable) apply. The WIG has taken over the task to create a quantitative model for determining the cost depending on the size of the station. The model will demonstrate the effectiveness of such models on the basis of the therapy (IPS). Different size and operational scenarios of the IPS can be calculated with the model.
