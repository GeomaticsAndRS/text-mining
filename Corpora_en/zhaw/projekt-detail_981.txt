Addressing the needs of blood and blood stem cells for the Swiss health care system represents a challenge. Nevertheless, there are few empirical studies that examine the behavior of the donation in the Switzerland. In-depth knowledge of the motives and barriers of generosity is an important basis to maintain the existing pool of donating blood and blood stem cells and new giving to win. The planned study is the first comprehensive study of the motivations and barriers of generosity for blood and blood stem cells in the Switzerland and combines qualitative and quantitative methods.
