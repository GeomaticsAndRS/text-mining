The offered study has a twofold objective. In a first step, a methodology for determining monetary costs of crime will be developed. It shows what approaches to evaluation are possible, doing what assumptions have to be made and where the prob leme lie in the application. The methodological part based on literature primarily from Anglo-Saxon, where on this subject in the last 25 years increasingly has been published. In a second step, the results of existing studies are condensed consolidated and discussed their verifiability to Swiss conditions. It can be also first rough calculations for the costs of crime, or for the benefit of the reduction of crime. Own detailed estimates of Swiss costs are not provided in this study. This would be rather issue of a possible follow-up study, which could include also a comprehensive cost benefit analysis of concrete measures in prisons.
