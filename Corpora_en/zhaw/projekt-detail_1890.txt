Partner AG, construction Office Winterthur-city development of a modular system of bridges in fibre composite technology. The novelty of this system consists in fastening technology. For the first time, profiles made of fibreglass (GRP) with preloaded plastic fiber fins (CFRP) are held together. The system eliminates this Assembly gluing and mounting screw. It is registered in the approach to the patent. The bridge system is very flexible in the way of use and can easily be used at two locations in other shape (length, width, curvature, etc.). The resulting bridge is very cheap compared to today's bridges made of fiber composite materials, because the materials regarding their properties be used optimally. The savings in comparison to today's FRP bridge is 20 - 70%. In addition, economically optimum cross-sections for the bending beam are developed. The nowadays primarily used diameters and flat profiles, beams, U - not suitable for large bending carrier. This project creates a bridge with a span of about 16 m in Winterthur on behalf of the city. The results obtained from the research flow directly in the development of a real object. The ZÃ¼rcher Hochschule Winterthur has carried out preliminary tests regarding the fundamental feasibility of the system between December 1998 and March 1999.
