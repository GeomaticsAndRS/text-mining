Since the beginning of business economics (scientific management) one of the important issues for companies is the increase of labour productivity and work performance. At the beginning we focused first and foremost on the optimisation of work processes (analysis of work processes, ergonomics, performance pay) to questions about motivation and leadership. Since the "value chain" by M. Porter are the primary value-added activities in the Centre. The support processes are mainly considered a cost factor, on the essentials and lowest cost should be limited. The effects of support processes on the primary/value-added processes is largely unaware. Only individual companies so far use the performance-supporting potential of support processes (such as Google tries to support its employees, so that they can deal with their core activities). Currently, there are numerous studies on the subject of labour productivity/performance. They consider only individual aspects (influence of microclimate on the labour power or influence of light on job performance, influence of errors/disruption on the labor). Studies, which have the contribution of support processes for the primary activities to the subject, in particular for the FM support processes are lacking. Most pointedly, is whether the output of 1 CHF in FM services improve productivity by more or less than 1 CHF, respectively, is the ratio of support to primary activities 1:1 or whether as here assumed the FM services in this regard take a multiplier function. In the context of this preliminary project should in this respect already empirically collected data from about 7\
