The four universities of applied science HES-SO, SUPSI, BFH and ZHAW raised together by means of focus group discussions, interviews and an online Delphi survey the future research priorities of physiotherapy from the perspective of researchers and practitioners, other health professionals, patient organisations, authorities, education providers and health and accident insurance. In 17 focus group discussions as well as 24 individual interviews, conducted in the German Switzerland, the French-speaking Switzerland and Ticino, possible topics for research were collected. These were then regarded in an online Delphi survey by total 293 representatives inside of the above mentioned interest groups in relation to their importance. Research in the fields of physiotherapy examination and diagnosis, treatment and prevention is considered as highest priority. Among the clinical areas as particularly important judged are the musculoskeletal area or orthopedics, Neurology and geriatric. A more detailed analysis of the qualitative data has demonstrated three underlying themes which deal with the respondents in relation to physical therapy to a large extent: the identity of the profession, the interdisciplinarity and the visibility.
