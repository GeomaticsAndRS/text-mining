In the WSL - research programme space demands of man and nature, scenarios of future development of space were periurbaner landscapes with the Dyna-CLUE framework (conversion of land use and its effects; Ver Burg over Mars 2009, landscape ecology 24) empirical statistical models (Bronwyn Price, WSL). These scenarios are number encoded information (fields) in the HA grid, which are difficult to grasp for outside stakeholders and stakeholder and complicate assessments (unexpected) consequences for biodiversity and quality of life. The visualization of raster-based scenarios requires the transfer of cell values (fields) in diskete objects such as buildings, infrastructure or vegetation (entities). In this context, new research service is provided, to visualize the spatial development scenarios in high-quality and inexpensive at the same time. Within the framework of feasibility studies and usability testing, available calculation routines and algorithms of geographical information systems (GIS) are modified and new tools combined procedurally as performant and automated in realistic landscape visualization to translate the empirical statistical spatial development scenarios in the HA grid.
