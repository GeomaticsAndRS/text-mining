The overall objective of the outlined project is the establishment of a remote sensing-based monitoring and competency focus at the Institute for environment and natural resources of the Zurich University of applied sciences. Within this arrival thrust project basis-creating construction work be carried with the expertise of the research group geo-informatics and environmental planning and universit√§rerer and research-related partners. A civilian remote sensing drone is used in selected pilot studies to document activities of Auenrenaturierung and the development of glacier aprons. Several ground campaigns carried large-scale aerial flying be evaluated photogrammetrically then, analyzed with remote sensing and interpreted in collaboration with the cooperation partners. The influence of the accuracy of the positioning (GPS) and the parameters of the flight planning and evaluation will be investigated and subjected to a sensitivity analysis with systematic tests. Application-specific protocols for data collection and evaluation are developed from this basis.
