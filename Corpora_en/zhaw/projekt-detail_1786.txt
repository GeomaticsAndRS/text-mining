In the framework of the NFP48 project FUNalpin the module "Transfer" deals with the development of non-market-based financial flows between the public authorities and the Swiss Alps since the beginning of the nineties years. The investigation has shown that in structurally weak regions of the Swiss Alps, publicly motivated transfers (subsidies and financial compensation) make up a major part of the revenue of public and private bodies. The transfers for the landscape-relevant tasks in agriculture and forestry and for the tasks within the area of the environment and spatial planning taking a structurally rather weak, but significant scenic regions of Saffron (GR), Linthal (GL) and Binntal (Valais) scopes the largest amount. The project was completed in 2004.
