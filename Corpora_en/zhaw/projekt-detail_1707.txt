In this project, a methodology will be developed, with whose help to be expanded part functions of business processes of a larger organization (spziell of service industries) can be quantitatively analyzed and assessed (on cost and quality). While the accidental temporal fluctuations of orders, as well as the stochastically varying availability of resources take into account specifically the Insourcer. Using stochastic models and simulation models the resource requirements of the Insourcers is determined, which is required for this to meet the delivery deadlines agreed in the SLA and reaction times. The results of the project will allow the Insourcer, to estimate the cost of transferring a to resettling process and thus make a reliable quote. The outsourcer is can compare his effectively costs with the costs calculated on the basis of the model with the help of the project results. Therefore, a benchmark is the Outsourcer for his legal costs, taking into account the various factors of uncertainty available.
