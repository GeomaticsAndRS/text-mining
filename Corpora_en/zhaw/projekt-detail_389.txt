The project team "Orthoptera-app and wiki" (Zurich University of applied sciences, ZHAW WÃ¤denswil and locust experts from orthoptera.ch) developed a Smartphone application to the determination of locusts and builds a Web page with comprehensive portraits of all 106 Swiss locust species. Content and the aim of the research project "locusts" are good indicators to assess the condition or the ecological value of a Habitat. Knowledge of the distribution of the species is however flawed, and they learn little attention outside a small panel of experts. With the newly developed Smartphone application (briefly app), we would radically simplify the type determination of locusts in the Switzerland through combinable characteristics and thus make accessible to interested lay people and younger generations. The combination of different media such as image, sound and video material which was previously technically impossible in the traditional products is unique. Users learn many interesting facts about each type based on the portraits, can images and drawings look at and listen to different songs. Sighted species can be recorded with a "digital notebook" and exported for further processing and sent to a central database. This significantly expands the data pool and knowledge gaps in the area of biodiversity can be closed. Scientific and social context the project with the two communication modules "Web page" and "App", aims to provide the compiled knowledge of the locusts. The website is to raise awareness among the public and serves as a data basis for the app. The app is mobile knowledge. The users and users can collect data about the species and send them to the central database of the fauna. There is a dialogue between science and society.
