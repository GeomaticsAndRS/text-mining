A prototype of a model is created in the context of a preliminary study. The model describes the dynamic behavior of the retirement system under the influence of demographics, legal framework and other market mechanisms. At the same time is the retroactive effect of the prevention system on the rest of the market, the capital market in particular, with modeled explicitly. The model has the objective to gain insight into the interaction between the Pension Fund and the capital market system. It will be not possible within the framework of the feasibility study to treat the question fully. The preliminary study aims rather to provide first insights into the dynamics of the pension system and demonstrate the fertility of the chosen approach. Thus, a solid starting point for a larger main project should be arranged in which the objectives can be achieved. In the context of the preliminary study, the unit can be used to identify potential project partners and clarified their willingness to support a follow-up project.
