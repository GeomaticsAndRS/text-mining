Drinking water must be free of pathogens, fecal pathogens according to legal requirements. The detection of pathogens such as salmonella is usually on the basis of indicator organisms such as Escherichia coli and required minimum current 24-28 hours. In the KTI project a quick test will be developed for the detection of indicator germs in drinking water, which is in about 3-5 hours information about the microbiological condition of the drinking water. The indicator organisms are isolated by filtration of the water and its rRNA in a single reaction by multiplex PCR detected. The quick detection allows a rapid action law enforcement agencies, military institutions and the industry if drinking water quality is no longer guaranteed.
