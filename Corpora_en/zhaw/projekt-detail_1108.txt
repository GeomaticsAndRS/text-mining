The culture collection of Switzerland (CCOS) has the challenging task to store deposited strains of micro-organisms from the environment and medicine properly and to maintain in the long term and to provide these cultures with special features for diagnosis, research and development as a national culture collection of Switzerland. The CCOS was rebuilt thanks to a CTI project (9922.1) with support of the FOEN and is very well connected with the membership of the World Federation of culture collections (WFCC) and SBA. Type strains of a newly described species or published strains can be deposited officially in the CCOS.
