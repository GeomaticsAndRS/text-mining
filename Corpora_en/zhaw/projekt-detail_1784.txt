Novartis recorded their environmental emissions in a large database. Thus, the current impact of business activity on the environment are being held. At the same time, the comparison of the current emission numbers with the figures is intended to allow the review of progress in the field of environment which could be achieved by optimization of processes. Objective of this work was to analyze the quality of the present data to global CO2 emissions of the Group and to quantify their uncertainty. The CO2 emissions is calculated as sum of individual emissions, which depicts the annual emissions of a specific plant due to consumption of a particular energy source. These individual emissions are formed usually by multiplying the consumed quantity of the energy carrier with the emission factor. The quantity as well as the emission factor are only roughly known. This results in an uncertainty of the overall emissions. In addition to these uncertainties, which are based on random variations, data collection was examined for systematic errors, improper system limits or incomplete recording of issuers.
