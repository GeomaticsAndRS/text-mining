Due to the postulated challenges "Energy revolution" and the related new markets for innovative solutions, transformation and use of energy will be in the next few years. This applies to technologies in the field of the rational use of energy ("energy efficiency"), the intelligent networks as well as for renewable energy. Moreover, new energy technologies will have more decentralised character. To take advantage of the opportunities, must be recognized in the sense of a future-oriented technology assessment developments in the social environment, identifies their impacts on technologies and linked to the resulting requirements with the know-how of engineers in science and practice. The objectives of the project are:-developing and testing an integrated and practical issues as directly applicable valuation model for individual technologies. -Develop a qualitative "effect model for a sustainable energy system" focusing electricity. -Developing and testing an INE-specific process and method sets for "Technology Horizon Scanning".
