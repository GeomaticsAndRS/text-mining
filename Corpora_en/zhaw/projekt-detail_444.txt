Risk infants are increasingly at risk of developing neuro-motor function disorders such as E.g. cerebral movement disorders. The evidence of the effect of the traditional treatment of neuro-motor development is unclear and therefore limited. The new concept of intervention "with coping and caring for infants with special needs" (COPCA), which is the coaching of parents and the action of the child in the Centre of therapy, shows trends to positive effects and should be examined in the Switzerland. The aim of the project is to achieve the best possible motor development by exploring the most effective physiotherapeutic action element. The project consists of three studies: 1 collect the content of traditional infant treatment (TIP) in the German Switzerland 2. evaluation of the changes of the content of infant treatment by the COPCA training 3. comparison of effects by COPCA and TIP on the motor development questions: • how much time (% share of treatment) spend children physiotherapists in the German Switzerland for which action items? • Take the time (% share of total treatment) that is spent for typical COPCA acts in the course of the COPCA training? • There are differences between stillborn children have received the COPCA or TIP: with regard to the primary evaluation parameters IMP and thus in the motor development, immediately at the end of the 6 months intervention and at the corrected age of 18 months? Methods: Cross-sectional / validation study - quantitative, descriptive, longitidinale observational study - randomized controlled trial results: - type of therapeutic actions, as they currently are applied - change the therapeutic actions by COPCA training - motor development of risk infants 6 months at 18 months of age and intervention
