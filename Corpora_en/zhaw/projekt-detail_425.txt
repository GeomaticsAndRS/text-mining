Swiss midwife Association SHV is of central importance for midwives, regardless of the respective supply model, in which they perform their high quality of obstetric care of women, their children and families. The Swiss Association of midwives has decided therefore in accordance with the statutory requirements to develop quality indicators for the services of free practicing midwives during pregnancy, childbirth, puerperium and lactation. The quality indicators identified in this project could provide a framework for the practical work of the free practising midwives, as well as clues to the measurement of quality.
