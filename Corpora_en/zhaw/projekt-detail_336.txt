ERBINAT ERBINAT is the Swiss Association for experience and education in nature. It brings together institutions and individuals who organise education and experiences in nature and integrate them as an important part in their work. The Office of the Association will be outsourced by may 2013 at the ZHAW. For ERBINAT, this means a professionalisation of the businesses, as well as an access to the expertise and networks of the ZHAW. For the IUNR and the research group environmental education - where the Office is now attached - is also a valuable access to the practical world of nature-related environmental education, a core topic of the research group. The project is set to indefinite time and will grow to a fertile connection, which enables the direct transfer of knowledge between education/research and practice, and promotes the development of quality on both sides.
