A simulation tool for the design and configuration of a previously partially automated production process is created for a construction company. Goal is to automate the partially automated process completely. Since the parts to be produced by different processes and different cycle times in these processes, it is not possible to calculate the demands made on logistics between these processes by statistical means. Bottlenecks can be detected, visualized and removed about experimenting with different system configurations and control strategies by means of simulation. The development of a tool for determining the optimal system configuration and control for different segments of customers is at the heart of the simulation study.
