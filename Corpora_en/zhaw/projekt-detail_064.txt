The entry of heavy metals in agricultural and garden Switzerland last but not least in the cases structurally used soils in recent decades in most, declined as a result of a consequent reduction of heavy metal-containing products at the source of the entry paths. A statutory, nearly comprehensive and continuous analysis of heavy metal content of recycled fertilizers permits an effective documentation of the remaining heavy metal entry in Swiss soils. In contrast to the documentation of heavy metal content in recycled fertilizers, there is still a data gap in relation to the origin and the distribution of heavy metals in waste biomass, especially in different qualities of green waste and material from the lawn maintenance and landscape management. A study1 conducted by the ZHAW Zurich University of applied sciences and the Bern University of applied sciences BFH, 2009 finds that the database for heavy metals in green goods is incomplete and mostly based on analyses from the 90s of the last century. Pollution data are missing for many substance flows, partly they are obsolete and no longer current, or transferable locally not on Swiss relations. The study recommends an extension of the data base for heavy metals in municipal solid waste, recycled used. Due to these recommendations the FOEN has decided, through extended heavy metal - analysis in a wide variety of green goods - Mono batches a data base for the (in revision owned) TVA technical regulation on waste, Anh. 4 to create. The update of heavy metal content will in future enable "new substances, to compare i.e. bio-waste or green goods groups from previously unknown or untapped sources with known materials and classified accordingly. Jointly by the Institute for biotechnology IBT and the Institute for the environment natural resources IUNR of the ZHAW the analytical survey of heavy metal content in green goods - update Mono batches is performed and documented.
