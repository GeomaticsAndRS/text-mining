In many experimental issues, it makes sense to cancel a series of tests or data collection once a sufficiently secure test result or if a desired size with sufficient security can be estimated in terms of time or cost savings or from ethical point of view. Such procedures, tests or estimates, where the scope of the data is not set beforehand, but represents itself a random size, are sequentially (sequential analysis, Sequentialverfahren). Sequential planning and statistical evaluation of tests can lead to significant cost savings, by the experimental scope is optimally adapted to the problem, i.e. the real distribution of the variables for the different hypotheses. Content of the project is the application of sequential methods in planning and carrying out of surveys, as well as in statistical quality control.
