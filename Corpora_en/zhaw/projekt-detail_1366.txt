Which actors try which arguments to green biotechnology in the public arenas to bring? What do journalists from this and what record citizens as to the opinion? These are questions that examined the IAM researchers Michael Schanne in collaboration with the Institute of mass communication and media research in a national fund project. The project with the title?Deciding about green biotechnology: actors and argument in the public arena? can in the framework of the NRP 59?Benefits and risks of the deliberate release of genetically modified plants? be realized. In theory are models of the public, the risk communication and the media effect research in the foreground; in methodological terms, worked during the two-year duration of the project with content analysis, experimental procedures, interviews and surveys.
