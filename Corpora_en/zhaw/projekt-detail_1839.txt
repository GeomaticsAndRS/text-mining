Gate Gourmet International AG is planning a new material flow concept for the operation at the airport of Melbourne. The capacity in the individual production and buffer areas are strongly dependent on the flight plan. There is a high degree of networking between the individual dishwashing, buffer and deployment areas and the resources. The arrival and departure flight scedule forming the central control element of the system. As a result of the departure flight plan is a backward from Traysetting. To create a parameterized simulation model based on the prepared layouts of the new flow of material. The flight plans form the basis for the workload data of the simulation model. Through the simulation, the material flow and the buffer capacity should be optimally designed. The following goals are achievable depending on flight schedules, in detail: – optimal sizing of the buffer (defined buffer, buffer open) - determine the workplace needs – capacity planning at the staff level - identification of bottlenecks in the flow of material to the assessment of the system used the following targets: - load the buffer during the simulation period - utilization of staff - load of plants in the material flow - behavior of traffic jam routes before bottlenecks - outbound delays the system load data, Targets and parameters are passed via Excel the Simulator. The responsible Planner by Gate Gourmet can investigate without knowledge of the simulation independently a variety of scenarios. The procedure and the model is designed so that with this model the catering areas can be globally tested and designed.
