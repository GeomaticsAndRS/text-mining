In recent years reform elements were introduced in public administration often in the area of public management, which can exert a significant influence on public service provision. According to the principles of public management, it is expected that the public sector provides its services efficiently and effectively, and with a strong customer focus. However, the scientific discussion of the concept of customer in the area of public management is mostly vague. In particular is hardly taken into account in the examined literature, that employees of public administration today are faced with increasing heterogeneity in their customer base. The proportion of foreigners in the population about is one aspect of this heterogeneity. So, the Switzerland, along with Luxembourg and Liechtenstein belongs to the countries with the highest proportion of foreigners in the population. The lack of consideration of these developments, and the associated heterogeneous customer structure of public administrations in the literature amazed as to suggest on the basis of experience reports from the practice is that many public services, including fashion, such as these are provided, among different customer groups develop different or at best no effect, achieving the desired objectives not in sufficient measure. In regard to the constitutionally guaranteed principle of equal treatment (article 8 of the Federal Constitution) is to assess this as problematic. In the framework of the research project will be administrations due to a heterogeneous customer structure at their tasks or services are faced with challenges and what factors influence on dealing with heterogeneous customer groups investigated therefore.
