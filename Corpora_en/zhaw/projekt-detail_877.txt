Development and optimisation of a recipe in which normal flour-ingredients are replaced by a new ingredient (modified starch). Different recipes shall be developed to identify the best organoleptic quality. The next objective of the collaboration is to provide first evidence for an enhanced effect of satiety in food containing this new functional ingredient. In parallel a sensory consumer study shall be carried out to evaluate the acceptance of the developed products.
