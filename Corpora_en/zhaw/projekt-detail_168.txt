eaternity the CarbonFoodPrint project sustainability is unique in its approach to transferring scientific findings to the CO2 footprint of food above the restaurant in the public and consumer decision product transparency towards to steer. Through the educational work on the impact of food consumption on climate change, as well as the practical implementation, the project can make a significant contribution to climate protection. A scalable solution is developed in the framework of the project CarbonFoodPrint, which allows guest robe drives easy to integrate the management of CO2 in their day-to-day business. For this a CO2 food database is built on the one hand, based on eco balance sheet data, which specifically provides the relevant decisions for the catering industry. On the other hand, a software is developed, which allows easy and automated process of this data in the hospitality practice. The functionality and scalability of this interface between science and technician is tested in a pilot project with several Gastropartnern. The planned pilot project to identify among other vulnerabilities in the software and cause, that they can take advantage of guest robe drives.
