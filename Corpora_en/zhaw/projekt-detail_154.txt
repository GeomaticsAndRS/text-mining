Society for process management Switzerland the Exchange and cooperation between the Swiss hospitals works limited. Although these very similar performance orders track and according to similar processes have (E.g. patient recording process), yet every man for himself developed the processes. Big redundancies are the result. What is lacking is a comprehensive reference model to the design of hospital processes. On behalf of the society for process management Switzerland examined the WIG, which transferred to the hospital process world (supply chain operations reference) can be "lessons learned" from the successful industrial model "SCOR".
