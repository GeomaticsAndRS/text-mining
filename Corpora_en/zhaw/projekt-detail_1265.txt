Duration: 2008-2009 The aim of this pilot project was to outline challenges private enterprises are faced with in the context of a growing internationalisation of business activities in Switzerland. A direct outcome of the pilot project has been a funding proposal to KTI and the National Science Foundation (see website of Christiane Hohenstein for details), as well as one scientific publication. Publication: Patrick Studer and Christiane Hohenstein (2011). Linguistic diversity in business contexts: a functional linguistic perspective. Winterthur: ZHAW. (Working Papers in Applied Linguistics 1). 4-26. Original abstract: Companies which operate internationally typically think of cross-cultural diversity primarily in terms of their facilities abroad. Establishing a subsidiary in Japan or implementing a new compensation system in India clearly calls for a focus on the impact of both cultural and language differences to ensure success of the enterprise. While numerous studies have dealt with the cross-cultural dimensions of multinational operations, few systematic investigations have explored the effect of language diversity on management in-teractions. This joint research project by the School of Applied Linguistics and the School of Management of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences aims to investigate the impact of increased language di-versity â ranging from the official languages of Switzerland to the use of English as the corporate language in the headquarters organization â on communication structures and on the develop-ment of effective management policies and approaches in home offices.
