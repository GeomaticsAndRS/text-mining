In the course of legal writing, students need hands-on training to the theoretically learned seminar content in practice to be able to apply. The Institute for business law would add his E-assessment to check the punctuation to elements of game based learning. The language is an important tool - for business lawyers if not even the most important. The comma Cannon offers students the opportunity to test their knowledge of the Inperpunktion in a playful way and to improve. The project serves as a learning tool of control and increase the knowledge of the spelling. Students of the programme law of the ZHAW primarily are targeted. Goals = students use the software = which is interactive to developing software to control and improve their right scream confessions = dealing with the application make fun = the software can be used with the project for other centres and institutes, as well as for external customers is used consistently for the first time on playful elements in learning. We are looking forward to the experience!
