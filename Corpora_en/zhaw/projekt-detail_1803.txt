In the project OPESS (operations management, ERP and SCM systems) of the Swiss virtual campus prepared topics from the fields of logistics and business processes for the web-based higher education. The project is supported by institutes of the ETHZ, EPFL and the University of Bern and university partners. Among other things, the Institute for data analysis and process design is involved. The goal of the idp participation is the development and deployment of interactive learning environments, which are based on simulation of a company (flight simulators for management education). Experience has shown that a faster and more effective learning is with such environments than by the theoretical transfer of knowledge alone. An e-learning course is especially good for such a form of learning, because the computer as necessary technical condition already exists. So far the operations management practiced at Swiss universities and universities of applied sciences in the field of this form of learning still little. The work of the idp considerably help to spread this new way of interactive learning. On the ZHW, simulation-based interactive learning environments are operations management for three years in the course and operations management in the new postgraduate course.
