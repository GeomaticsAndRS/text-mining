Despite huge investments in ever more powerful IT planning resources, the yield is always unsatisfactory. Several empirical studies show that the majority of companies can no longer achieve its logistic objectives with the available systems. Increasing connectedness and dynamics lead to growing irritation, uncertainty and thus increasing complexity in enterprise. The rigidity of the planning methodology in a declining quality of planning inevitably leads to the ever-increasing amount of planning. Foundations for an IT-based planning methodology will be developed now within this project using approaches from the Synergetics and Cybernetics and psychology, which effectively supports people to deal competently with the encountered complexity. The Institute for data analysis and process design (idp) works in this project together with the Institute of business engineering (IBE) and the Department of applied psychology (both University of applied sciences North Western Switzerland), and industrial research partners.
