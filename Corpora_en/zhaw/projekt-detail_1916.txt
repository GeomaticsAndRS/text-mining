The PECK method is a result from the work of four partners in the sector of IP technology waste from the Schwerpunktpro g environment (1996-1999). The procedure was already signed to the patent. The PECK Consortium has put together a comprehensive documentary about the technical and economic feasibility of the procedure last year and made the concept of (inter) nationally known. The Consortium aims to implement the procedure in the next few years in practice. The orientation of the research project transfer-PECK on issues relating to PECK supports this transfer efforts of the industrial consortium and allows the integration of ecological and social aspects. Social compatibility are key issues of our work package: what positive/negative social impacts are to be expected in the implementation of the PECK method? What is required, so that the proceedings in public and accepted by the operators of waste plants?
