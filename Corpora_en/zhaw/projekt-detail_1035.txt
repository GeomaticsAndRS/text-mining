Chronic nonspecific back pain cause enormous social costs. Movement therapy (exercise) is effective to reduce the disability. Specific treatments for different types of back pain are missing however. In recent years, clinical tests were designed to test the ability of muscular stabilisation within the large group of patients with nonspecific low back pain. In a randomized controlled study, the effectiveness of specific physical therapy should now be examined in patients with lumbar back pain. Patients are treated with an insufficient muscle function with a specific treatment or with General exercises. Then the patients be controlled after one year. If the specific exercises are more effective and reduce the disability by back pain, an important step forward means this targeted treatment of patients with nonspecific low back pain.
