IBM research with the help of SoE would like to IBM Research realize the Railtransport services environment (RTSE). Planning and dispatching strategies should be simulated, evaluated and optimized with this world's first, fully integrated simulation environment for the operation of rail transport. The Central Planungskom ponente of the RTSE to be a strategic product of IBM, with which IBM Foundation program creates for his 'smarter rail'. The solution scenarios for this planning component to minimize the overall delay to cause changes.
