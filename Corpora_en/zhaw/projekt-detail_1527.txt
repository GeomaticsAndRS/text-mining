Paul Scherrer Institute most approaches to the realistic simulation of fuel cells build up on the 3D modeling of the fundamental processes of transport of materials, heat, charge and impulse (flow). Thus, it is only conditionally possible to model cells and stacks of technical relevance even on super computer system. The aim of the present project is the development and validation of numerically efficient models for polymer electrolytes membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Such models play an important role not only in the development of commercial fuel cell systems, but also find application in electrochemical processes. The approach followed at the CCP Center for Computational Physics used to determine 3D part models of cell extracts to so-called effective parameters, which are used in reduced 2 1D-Modellen whole cells and stacks. At the 2 1D-Technik of mass transfer in anode and cathode describes 2D models by two, that are coupled via 1D-Interaktion. This allows for the efficient analysis of complete systems of technical relevance. This modeling technique was to the CCP for the "solid oxide fuel cell" SOFC system already successfully applied. To transfer this method on PEM systems, new material models must be implemented as the transport processes in PE membranes are more complex than in the SOFC. Further additional interactions, such as the Zweiphasentransport in the gas diffusion zones exist. The suitability of the approach for PEM fuel cells, Institute PSI should be demonstrated by experiments at the Paul Scherrer with help and then used for current optimization problems of the PSI.
