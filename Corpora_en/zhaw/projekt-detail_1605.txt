The Winterthur district TÃ¶ss is in transition. Various factors (traffic, industrial sites, migration, demographics) change very fast and strong. The population is insecure. Together with the city of Winterthur thus three polytechnics (HSSAZ, HSA Luzern and ZHW) have carried out a development process with the involvement of the population, with large group events, working groups, etc. The CTI finances the evaluation of the project.
