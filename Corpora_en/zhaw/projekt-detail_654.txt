The Oxford foot model makes it possible to show movement of the foot. Orthopaedics applied so often, to determine whether a surgery of the lower limbs is necessary, or to show how an operation has impacted on the gait of the patient. At present, the data obtained are only partially usable, because shifting the curves in the vertical and thus lost the ability to recognize the magnitude of a disease like cerebral palsy. Since three markers of the model are glued very close to the heel pad, it's obvious that the markers move by deformation of the heel pad. This change also the angle. The aim of this study is to measure these shifts and to determine their impact on the angle. This project is a master's thesis (ETH). The project was successfully completed.
