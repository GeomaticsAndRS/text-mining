Surgery in dental restoration requires the need of the availability of solid bone material. Various bone augmentation procedures have been developed over years for the treatment of bone defects. Thereby, the treatment of large bone defects, caused e.g. by bone resorption in consequence of tooth loss, often involves the use of autologous bone grafts. However, critical size defects require the presence of a sufficient amount of bone graft material to ensure mechanical stability, which implicates an additional operation, discomfort, risks and expenses for the patient. The present project will therefore aim at the development of a shapeable synthetic bone repair material, which consists of a novel and innovative combination of a synthetic ceramic scaffold and new formed hydrogel matrix serving as signaling factor delivery system to facilitate the repair of bone defects. Experiments will be performed to demonstrate that both materials can be combined to create a suitable and advanced implant material. Moreover, we will establish necessary analytical methods and perform in vitro as well as in vivo experiments, which will characterize the interaction of material and tissue as well as its integration. Thereby, the ZHAW will expand the international network cooperating with the Institute Straumann AG as well as the Georg-August-University in GÃ¶ttingen (Germany). The resulting product will be a novel bone graft in block form for critical size defects with osteogenic characteristics equivalent to autologous bone, or even better with respect to resorption resistance properties. It will offer a substantial potential in dentistry to augment the jaw bone and hence, allow the successful as well as cost saving dental implant treatment without additional risk and pain for the patient.
