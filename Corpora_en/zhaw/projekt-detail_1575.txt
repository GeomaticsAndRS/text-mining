An optimized PROFINET IO stack on a hardware module developed is realized with a ColdFire Processor and the Linux operating system. The module is universally installed to support different field bus systems, as well as the requirements for an IRT switching unit of the PROFINET IO. These components are used in the future also to the PROFINET training. The PROFINET IO stack implemented extensions, such as topology discovery, cross-traffic, IPsec and SNMP coupling. This is collaborated actively in the PN user bodies.
