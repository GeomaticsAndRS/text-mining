The incorporation of functionalized nanoporous silicates with well-defined pore systems into the cladding of a polymer optical fiber is the basis for the development of a nanoporous hybrid optical fiber platform. The project investigates the fundamental concepts and techniques for the construction of the platform and establishes its versatility by focusing on three specific applications, namely controlled drug release (light in, drugs out), optical sensing (analyte in, light out), and light-harvesting (light in, concentrated light out). The drug release system will allow light-triggered release of stored substances along the fiber and provide a high degree of adaptability in terms of being able to accommodate a large variety of active species. The nanoporous hybrid optical fiber sensor will be primarily constructed to detect ammonia. Insights from these studies are expected to inspire similar principles for the sensing of other gases, such as oxygen or carbon monoxide. The light-harvesting system, closely related in design to the optical sensor, will employ a multi-dye system to enable efficient absorption of light and transport along the fiber with minimized losses. Applications of such light-harvesting fibers are in the fields of solar energy and daylighting.
