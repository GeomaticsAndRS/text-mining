Creating movies. Extension of GIS-based software for determining the glare of solar systems. The software determines the areas potentially affected by glare on the map for every time in the year and evaluates these areas. The range is especially at the time when large PV installations (E.g. on avalanche protection, quarries, etc.). For smaller solar installations (E.g. on roofs), a GIS special third-party software is created in a yet unpublished project. This is currently in the testing phase.
