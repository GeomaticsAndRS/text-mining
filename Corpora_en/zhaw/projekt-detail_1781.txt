To improve cell culture technology a device could as prototypes are developed, produced and used in cell culture technology with success. With this automated device, cells could be successfully increased. In the subsequent use of these cells to the tissue engineering (tissue engineering) they behaved as if they were manually engineered. The extracellular matrix and the bio-mechanical properties of cartilage and heart valve tissue were similar. Innovative solutions to technical problems (fluid handling, bottle caps, and control) finally allowed a semi automatic multiplication of cells. The scientific and economic objectives in accordance with project review 03 could largely be complied with a delay of one month. On the basis of the experience gained, the prototype can be designed optimally well in a follow-up project.
