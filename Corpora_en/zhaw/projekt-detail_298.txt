Energy transformation assumes a high share of fluctuating renewable energy sources in the future network. To compensate for these fluctuations, energy storage is an essential component. Today, the Power2Gas concept, which is based on the conversion of surplus electricity in chemical energy (production of gas by electrolysis), is the only known way for a long-term storage, which can compensate for also seasonal generation and fluctuations in consumption. The project RENERG2 examines all aspects and challenges of Power2Gas technology, like electrolysis, power, influence of the mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to existing infrastructure, decentralized combined heat and power efficiency possible solutions, etc. our part of this project focuses on the modeling and analysis of the technical and economic potential uses of a power-to-gas plant in the regional energy system under various future scenarios of different.
