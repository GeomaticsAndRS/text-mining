Research on the development of lightweight solar power plant, which allows the double use of land in the urban area for the production of renewable energy, are carried out in the project. This minimizes the loss of earnings and efficient power production in an urban area, so at point of use, allows. In the subproject hybrid lightweight structural be clarified the feasibility and hybrid construction elements created a concept study for a structure using fiber reinforced plastic. Special emphasis on the reduction of the grey energy and improvement of Ecology through the clever combination of modern materials and the training of a customized, high-performance structure.
