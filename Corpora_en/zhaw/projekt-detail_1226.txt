Hochschule Luzern research results of from various science disciplines confirm the positive correlation between landscape and promoting human health. For example, landscape aesthetically valuable, agricultural landscapes in densely populated areas and recreation areas can positively impact the health of the population. The findings about the health risk factors such as noise, bad air, limitation of the scope etc. already incorporated into concepts of landscape planning and design. However, most intervention approaches focus on the reduction and mitigation of sickening environmental factors. A specific consideration of the health-promoting effects of landscape within the framework of current instruments of planning practice is however largely missing. With the planning tool landscape development concept (LEK) is an instrument at the disposal of landscape design that has proven itself in practice as a result of the process-oriented and interdisciplinary approach for sustainable landscape development of municipalities and regions. How existing concepts and planning instruments of landscape development already take into account the relationship between landscape and health promotion, is examined in the present study. For this purpose, the two documents were exemplarily consulted Toolbox LEK (HSR 2002) and the LEK of the commune of Cham (Cham 2005 LEK) and analysed using qualitative content analysis. On the basis of a theory derived category system, it is analyzed how health-promoting aspects, respectively with regard to what aspects LEK planning instrument possibly should be supplemented. As results, recommendations and implementation proposals exist which in future aspects of health promotion explicitly can be incorporated in LEK and thus specifically taken into account. In particular, on the basis of this study, it is possible to formulate health development goals and measures for a landscape and to optimize the use of the health-promoting potential.
