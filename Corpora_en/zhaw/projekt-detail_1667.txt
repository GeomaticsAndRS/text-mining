armasuisse VBS as consequence of the reformation of the army XXI in future supplying the troops planned centrally. The strategic information system of logistics SISLOG based on this planning. This consists of two parts, the DWH (data warehouse) and the specialist system AWSS (evaluation and simulation system). Optimal supply strategies, within the required timeframe for the daily business cannot be determined with conventional static methods. It was a tool for determining optimum resources for supplying troops. The simulation of logistics is a proven tool for the logistical planning of the operation and is used successfully for years. Building on elements of the AWSS, a transport simulation tool has been programmed, which quickly and efficiently supports the troop supply planning. The tool on the one hand for the strategic transport planning, as used for the day-to-day business and associated through an automated interface with the VFIS (supply - management information system). Thanks to the simulation model, the responsible designers dominate the dynamic interplay of quantities, capacity, routes and vehicle types, delivery request time and departure times. The total time of driven routes will be optimized. Deployment plans for vehicles and chauffeurs are created and detected vulnerabilities. Detailed tour plans for the individual drivers are the result of the optimization. The optimization via genetic algorithms.
