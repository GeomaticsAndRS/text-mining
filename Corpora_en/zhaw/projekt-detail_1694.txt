Federal Office for the environment the focus of the work was the spatio temporal distribution of NO2 pollution load in an Alpine Valley, which is strongly affected by the transalpine routes. This, in particular, the share of road transport on air pollution was quantified. Were estimated on the basis of information on the regional emissions and meteorological conditions in the study area each source component for the example Erstfeld (Canton of URI). In the period 2007-2009 the total traffic of the highway A2-initial field for about 40% of the pollution load was responsible – the freight alone caused approximately 25% of the total pollution load. During the investigation period, the work on the new Alpentransversale (NEAT) also significantly contributed to the NO2 exposure. These works are now finished – according to the proportion of traffic increases in the total NO2 emissions. The contribution of the total traffic on the A2 at the NO2 emissions is around 55%, the proportion of heavy freight traffic alone is around 35%, after out account of the NEAT part. Apart from the contribution of the motorway, 20% of NO2 Immissions load comes after completion of NEAT construction approx. from the local traffic and 25% of stationary sources. With the progressive exhaust and engine technology, it is to be expected in the future with a strong decrease of the trade share of the NO2 Immissions load.
