Introduction. The bypass surgery is the most common heart operation. Blood vessels of the body be used to work around narrowed or blocked coronary arteries. Also machine (on-pump) gaining the coronary revascularization in modern cardiac surgery as well as coronary bypass surgery with cardio pulmonary to the beating heart without cardio pulmonary machine (off-pump) more and more. Problem statement. Measurements at the ETH in Zurich have shown project (computer aided and image guided medical interventions) in the framework of the CO-ME that at the target despite optimum fixation, a movement of the suction cups can not be prevented. The displacement is approximately 0.3 mm in x and y direction (surface of the heart), but approximately 2.0 mm in z-direction. Solution. The principle is based on a two-time holder of the heart during a bypass operation. Contrary to the popular procedure, where the heart is locally fixed just by pressing on the stabilizer, this method goes the opposite way. The heart bed is flexible and allows it to beat the heart down. Above, the target is fixed locally by the suckers. This heart is not pressed on it; a slight lifting is even desirable. The result is a better stabilization without damage to the surface of the heart. The system consists of a holder of the heart and a stabilizer arm.
