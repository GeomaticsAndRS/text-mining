Haute École de santé Vaud decision processes with obstetric complications play a central role in clinical and non-clinical births. Women who are planning a birth at home or in the House have usually a low risk for a pathological history. However, unexpected complications can occur during childbirth. The independent management of this complex situation by the midwife is integral part of the professional birth support. In addition is the inclusion of women in the decision-making part of the professional job. The aim of the study is the closer examination of this complex obstetric situations, as well as an analysis of the factors that influence the decision-making process. Thus a developing theory in the midwifery is to contribute to. The Swiss National Science Foundation SNSF supports this grounded theory study.
