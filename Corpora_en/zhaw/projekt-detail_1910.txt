Differential contextual influences facilitate some ecological behaviors and constrain others in different sites. The General Ecological Behavior (GEB) scale of Kaiser (1998) acknowledges contextual influences on behavior, uses behavior difficulties systematically, and is therefore effective for cross-cultural applications. The present study compares ecological behavior in Spain and Switzerland. Questionnaire data from 330 Spanish and 330 Swiss students (divided in environmental and other sciences) are compared. In general, Swiss students behave more ecologically than Spanish. Nevertheless, there are a few same ecological behaviors that are easier to conduct by students from environmental sciences in both countries. Several ecological behaviors turned out to be easier to conduct in Spain (especially due to climatic and low economic budget situations) than in Switzerland and vice versa. The higher ecological performance in Switzerland can be explained with the existence of a bigger amount of contextual factors (consumerism and transportation conditions, environmental education and information, etc.) facilitating ecological behavior. The GEB scale takes differential behavior difficulties into account that are most likely caused by contextual influences. The proposed behavior measurement approach guides the search for potentially useful political actions that make it easier for people to behave ecologically in some societies and, thus, can be adopted by others.
