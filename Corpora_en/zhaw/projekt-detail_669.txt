A deeper understanding of the microbial processes that lead to optimal fermented cocoa beans, is a prerequisite for the production of high quality cocoa and cocoa-based products, especially chocolate. In this project, the methodology for the identification and characterization of dominant microorganism flora of cocoa fermentation should be rebuilt. The methodology developed at the ZHAW will eventually be tested in field trials in kakaoprouzierenden countries.
