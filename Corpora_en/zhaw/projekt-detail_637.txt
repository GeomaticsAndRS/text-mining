The universities of Zurich and North-Western Switzerland carry out in a joint research project in cooperation with the information technology associations swissICT, ICTnet and SWEN and promoted by the Hasler Foundation, a Switzerland-wide study on the use and distribution of software development methods. Our focus is on the impact of agile software development methods to the Swiss IT industry. The study is aimed at all IT professionals in the Switzerland and Swiss companies with a significant proportion of IT. For the first time, the study provides a comprehensive and independent overview of the use and dissemination of agile software development methods and the influence of concrete software development practices for successful software projects.
