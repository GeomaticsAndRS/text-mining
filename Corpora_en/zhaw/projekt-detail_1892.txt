Dynamic review of various factors on the flight plan. Development and testing of strategies with a second reserve aircraft at the site of unique Zurich airport to improve flight punctuality. The measures examined in the Simulator for their effectiveness on the European network of flight Swissair/Sabena. Position the Swissair/Sabena cannot meet often the flight plan. By various factors, significant delays occur in part. Because the aircraft within the European area start several times a day from Zurich, these delays are cumulative. One way to counteract these delays, is the use of an additional reserve aircraft at the Zurich location. With a simulation study, target will be reviewed in the model the benefits of further reserve aircraft. In particular to examine the impact of additional reserve aircraft on the following figures: - all departures with a delay of maximum 3 minutes apply departure punctuality in % of all departures, as timely - all arrivals with a delay of maximum 15 min - passenger hours per passenger during a flight delay that is larger than 3 min apply Ankunftsp√ºnklichkeit in % of all arrivals as punctual - percentage of passenger hours, caused by an IR93 approach are very different the influence factors on the timetable and the connections very complex. A very simplified model is created at the beginning of the study. The data base is parsed by the Swissair/Sabena on the four targets. The data base includes a reserve aircraft. This data base will be as the operating point is referred to and is characterized by the expression of the target values. A flight plan for the simulation is created due to the data base. The simplified model is supplemented as far as until comparable targets emerge from the experiments. The experiment with the best values is known as modellBetriebspunkt. To assess the effect of implemented changes, the results compared to modellBetriebspunkt.
