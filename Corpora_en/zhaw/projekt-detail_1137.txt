The IAM has accompanied the customer, an employee of the BAG, over a period of two months to write. The topics of coaching resulted on the one hand from the analysis of the texts submitted in advance, on the other hand customer wishes and needs. Forms of work were: application-oriented inputs, feedback on independently written texts, joint drafting of texts, as well as joint text analysis.
