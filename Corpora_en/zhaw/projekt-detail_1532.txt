The used on the IDP and further developed models of traffic flow serve the study of the dynamics of transport in transport networks, as well as its forecast, which constitute the basis for traffic control. To achieve this, it is necessary to have a development environment available, with which a wide range of problems can be efficiently investigated. In the framework of this project, micro - and macroscopic modelling approaches should be linked to better understand the dynamic processes in road transport systems. Especially for routes without counting stations data can be generated by the micro simulation, which can be used as input by macroscopic models.
