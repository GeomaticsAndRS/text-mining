The availability of electrical energy supply for a data center of Payserv AG (a company of Telekurs Group) was quantitatively estimated in this study. It was the whole supply chain from the high-voltage network over the medium-voltage level and the ups (uninterruptible power supply) analyzed up to the end user. All subsystems and how they affect the overall availability were investigated. In such an analysis, on the one hand, the components of the subsystems and their parameters such as failure rates and repair times are recorded. In addition, the process flows (automated processes, on-call services, etc.) of the overall system must be considered. The current situation was compared with possible optimization scenarios. Quantitative bases for investment planning could be provided. Various competencies in the areas of energy and electrical engineering, process optimization and statistics were used for the assessments.
