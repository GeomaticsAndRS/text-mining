For the exploration of the human response and clinical gait analysis, it is necessary that data collected can be compared with a standard database. Each movement laboratory must take up its own data. For this purpose, the gait pattern by 40 adults aged between 20 and 60 years was recorded and stored in a standard database. Three different gear speeds were measured: the self-imposed speed, slow walking and jogging. The gait pattern was recorded using an infrared camera system, power plate and electromyography. In the clinical gait analysis, especially children with cerebral palsy are investigated. So, standard data were recorded in a further step by children aged between 7 and 14 years. Because here a special importance to the movement of the foot, the children were measured with the Oxford foot model. This model allows the more accurate assessment of the movement between the front and back foot. Aim of this project is a database of standard data of human Ganges, which is divided into different age groups, motion speeds and models. The project was successfully completed.
