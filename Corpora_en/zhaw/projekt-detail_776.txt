Procedures in the downstream processing of biopharmaceuticals are developed nowadays with design of experiments and automated systems to efficiently determine the optimal conditions for purification. A time - and labor-intensive step in so far was the manual production of numerous buffer with different ionic strength and pH values. Therefore, we have developed a software that allows defined buffer using liquid in just a few minutes to make a handling system.
