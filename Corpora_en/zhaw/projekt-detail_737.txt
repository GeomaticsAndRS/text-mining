Problem: Patients with non-specific lower back pain has been proven often have problems with the quality of movement of the lumbar spine. This means that they have trouble controlling their movements, accurately time or feel. Practical physiotherapists can not reliably measure this movement quality problems or even quantify. Question: can a portable system, consisting of motion and Acceleration sensors, which attached to the back, so like a wireless PC - interface with appropriate software identify these problems in the quality of motion and quantify? Method: Development and validation of a portable system in different steps by means of transverse and longitudinal studies. Expected result: an innovative portable system which attaches reliable and valid Bewegungsqualit√§ts problems in patients with lower back pain and supports the attending physiotherapist to the outcome evaluation of its interventions.
