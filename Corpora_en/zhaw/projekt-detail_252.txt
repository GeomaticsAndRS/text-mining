Health Department of the canton of Zurich the patient classification system SwissDRG on the remuneration of the services of the Swiss acute hospitals was introduced on January 1, 2012. The Swiss laws require the codes made by the hospitals carry out random checks to verify. This poses questions to determine the sample size, and to specify of a confidence interval for the mean difference of coding. The methodology for this is free, it must be however scientifically validated. In cooperation with the Department of health of the canton of Zurich, such a methodology has been developed in this project. This has shown itself in particular that all of the normal distribution-based procedure for the revision of the code are not suitable. For the newly developed methodology implemented a software, with which all calculations can be performed easily.
