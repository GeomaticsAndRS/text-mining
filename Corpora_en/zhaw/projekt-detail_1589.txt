The properties and quality of the material pairings of hip implants will be assessed on the basis of the real common wear and tear. To the measurement of components (balls, pans) explantierter hips on a Koordinatenmess machine (CMM). Based on a model, a robust method was developed for the wear zones on an ideal surface of the sphere to the quantification of the linear and volumetric wear.
