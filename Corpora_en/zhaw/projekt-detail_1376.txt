In the new consisting of (police and Justice Center), the entire transport of goods will be handled centrally via two ramps in the Interior of the new building complex. The space in the area of goods ramps are limited. The delivery and removal of the goods from this area should be regulated. The ramp area, only authorised vehicles to stop and the passage of emergency vehicles of the police should be guaranteed at all times. The sizing of buffers and management of material flows in the ramp area depends on the following factors and their interactions: - performance, availability, and control of goods lifts - lead time for the return and delivery of the goods on the ramps for transporting - material foot control from the ramps to the various floors of the building - organization of the goods transport on time window. Static, these factors can not be judged. In the sense of a holistic assessment of the planned system, the range of goods should be judged with a simulation study, dynamically. Bottlenecks should be uncovered and control concepts in the field of material flow and staff management should be developed. The following objectives were pursued with the simulation among others: • proof of the function of the planned system • determine the limits of the system • to pinpoint bottlenecks and elaboration of measures to fix • determine the impact of different scenarios for the delivery of goods and goods recirculation • determine what influence the individual system parameters on overall performance have - services of lifts - availability of lifts - lead times for transporting rear -...
