Paul Scherrer Institut publication=9858 height=400 width=600 Understanding of mass transport limitations in PEFC is of prime importance for optimizing performance and for better understanding of degradation. The anisotropic, porous gas diffusion structures (GDL) play an important role in the transport between channel and catalyst. Under condensing conditions (the general case), liquid water will occupy part of the void in the porous structure and thus change the properties of the pore network for gas transport. In 2007 gas diffusion structures have been analyzed by x-ray micro-tomography. Images with a resolution of 0.7 Î¼m were obtained. For the first time data was measured under compression (as is the real case in the fuel cell). The images were assembled to 3D-structures and surfaced. From these data critical properties, such as the anisotropic effective relative diffusivities and the anisotropic heat conduction can be obtained by calculation. A multiphysics model of a membrane electrode assembly of a PEM fuel cell has been formulated in 2007. The model describes the interaction between charge transport, the electrochemical reactions, heat transport, and heat production. The model was implemented in the programming language C in a numerically robust way to allow for run-time efficient computer simulations for a wide range of boundary conditions.
