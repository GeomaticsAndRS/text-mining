The Association IG Aronia Switzerland deals since 2009 with the Swiss cultivation of chokeberry with the main objectives, to increase the degree of familiarity and the cultivation of healthy fruit, to promote and to coordinate. Aronia offer valuable and healthy phytonutrients according to numerous studies. It is discussed that they have great potential to the preventive effects against chronic diseases, as well as positive effects on general health. On the basis of the interesting benefits and in connection with the current market trend for healthy food is to assume that the demand for Aronia will increase in the future. Last year, approximately 900 000 Swiss Aroniast√§ucher were planted by the Verein IG Aronia. The future profitability of Aronia is appreciated by approximately 125 tonnes in 2012 up to 1000 tons in the year 2020. Obviously, there is therefore a great need for research, to improve the marketing of Aronia, as well as their products and to develop new opportunities, not least in order to promote the sales of berries on the Swiss market. During a visit by the Association IG Aronia Switzerland by Mr Konrad (Aronia Switzerland President) and Mr Weber (Managing Director) at the ZHAW, Institute for food and beverage innovation, on 12 September and 19 December 2013, cooperation for the further development of Aronia and their products with the Department was agreed (represented by Mr. Dr. Norbert Fischer) nutrition (represented by Mrs Dr. Sych and Mrs Prof. Brombach) and of ingredients Department.
