Prionics AG, Schlieren Prionics AG examined blood samples from animals with known health (healthy or sick) by means of a SELDI TOF mass spectrometer different proteins, which should serve later as a marker to identify a possible disease in samples of unknown animals. Our research aimed to assess the performance of the spectrometer on the one hand and on the other hand, to clarify whether the applied method allows a successful classification of samples at all. Our approach: the raw mass spectra were the starting point of the analysis. The data were used before baseline correction and other transformations of the spectrometer to optimally exploit the existing information. Both the masses and the intensities were logarithmised in a first step at the same time kDalton with consistent accuracy to be able to analyze the small and large peaks in the Spectra over the entire mass range from 1 to 200. Then the spectra in an automated process using robust local regression were zero lines [Andreas F. Ruckstuhl et al.;] Baseline subtraction using robust local regression estimation; Journal of quantitative spectroscopy radiative transfer 68; 179-193 (2001)] corrected and together graphically displayed on a total of two false colour cards. Thus, the complex spectra of all 207 spectra in the lower or upper mass range could be compared at a glance.
