Young Comrating ZKB, Canton of Zurich reporting in terms of a \ true fair view\ in the public sector hardly a topic. At the international level standards were created now with the IPSAS for the first time for the public sector. The CTI project examined the application of IPSAS in the Swiss environment based on a restatement of the financial statements of 2001 of the city of Kloten. In addition to accounting issues, including the cost-benefit ratio of such a project has been evaluated. In this context, also the new capital requirements of banks (Basel 2) or the associated rating requirements play an important role. The results indicate that the Swiss accounting model for public finances (HRM) basically is compatible with IPSAS, but a systematic further development needs. The appearance differs according to IPSAS materially and formally from presentation to HRM. It conveys essential, risk-relevant information in a compact form, however, dispenses with the naming of many details. In particular the uniform consolidation, review and disclosure in the annex represent an important step towards the harmonisation of material.
