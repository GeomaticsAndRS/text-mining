B端hler AG is a worldwide leading manufacturer of machines and plants in the food industry. In particular China and India compete with increasingly the market by copying existing plants. Aim of this research project is the development of an automatic planning tool for the sizing in the food sector by using the logistic simulation in combination with optimization algorithms. The tool generates cost-effective over a 3-tier optimization method in the Simulator, on the needs of the customer, grain processing optimized equipment for the area of B端hler AG. Thanks to the animation the simulation should be used in the future as important sales and communication tool. Through faster response to customer requests for new installations, by better meeting of the customer requirements with minimum investment costs and through the innovative high-tech appearance of Buhler enables the tool of the company an important differentiation relative to its international competitors and allows a long term customer loyalty or acquisition. At the end of the research project is a planning tool for the plant design and production optimization of Division grain processing the company of B端hler AG. The procedures and methods can be transferred for the plant and production planning in other industries. Project funded by the CTI focuses on the development of a new planning tools and an automated method for the Division of grain processing of B端hler AG, Uzwil.
