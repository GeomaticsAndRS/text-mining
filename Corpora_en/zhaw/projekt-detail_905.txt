The aim of the project is to draw a differentiated picture of the medical interpreting activity by the requirements to the professional profile, the practical interpretation and, in particular, the role behaviour from different perspectives (doctors, nurses, cultural) are recorded and evaluated through a written survey. In addition, interpreting interviews (Albanian/German and Turkish/German) based on the transcripts of both from medical interpreting scientific point of view are analyzed. These talks focus on the psychiatric and psychological settings. The results from the interdisciplinary work should lead to defined standards and best-practice models for Gespr√§chsleitende, cultural and exchanges. Also, they serve the operationalization in continuing education for cultural. Another result is the initiation of a data bank with first 1000 entries (Albanian/German and Turkish/German).
