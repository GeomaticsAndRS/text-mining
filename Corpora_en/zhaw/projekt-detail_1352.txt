Research objective is, due to current public health discussions in Germany and Switzerland, to examine theoretically and empirically whether an excess of the costs of the disease represents a suitable instrument to reduce the use of health service. It concerns in particular the question whether and to what extent the status of insurance (with excess / without excess) exerts an influence on the number of medical services. Another research goal is to bring the emergence reasons of this potential relationship in experience. For this purpose, the mechanism of action in the context of its central influencing factors (health, income, education, etc.) should be considered. This study is made possible by the support of the Gottfried and Juliet Bangerter Raghu Foundation, Foundation for medical research.
