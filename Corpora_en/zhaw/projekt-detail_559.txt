The recently created International Foresight Academy is the first organization to bind together foresight activities around the globe and from contrasting cultural and political contexts. Foresight activities vary with regard to their functions in political strategy formulation of modern democracies. Many foresight practitioners value the possibility granted by foresight exercises to bring topics on the political agenda that need to be discussed with stakeholders. IFA consists of two parts: a research part dedicated to foresight as a format of participation in different democratic traditions; and a second part that manages the networking of the partners doing research on foresight with regard to participation and societal challenges. The network will involve activities such as mutual knowledge exchange, summer/winter schools, academic seminars and final conference. The European Academic Seminar addressing issues around foresight, public participation and decision-making with parallel sessions on smart futures (e.g. cities, energy) was held on 16-18 September 2013 at ZHAW in Winterthur, Switzerland.
