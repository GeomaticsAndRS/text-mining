The aim of this coordination-action is to assemble and assess comprehensive teaching and demonstration material which should enable all primary school children (ISCED 1 Level of education according to UNESCO) to discover basic concepts of ecology and obtain hands-on experience in cycling of elements in nature and thus the potential of wastewater as a resource. Due to the universal appeal of nature to children these systems have a great potential to integrate both sexes as well as disadvantaged and underperforming groups such as immigrant children. br br These classroom systems will result from ongoing research in nature-oriented systems, and will refclect today & 039;s best available technology. The contributions of the network partners will help to disseminate best available technology from different regions of Europe.
