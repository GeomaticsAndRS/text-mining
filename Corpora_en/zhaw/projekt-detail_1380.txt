Climate change altered the face of Swiss landscape. Already, for example, the aprons of the glacier claim an area of 500 square kilometers. The warmer climate will have a more striking expansion of glacier aprons and other primary succession spaces (E.g. landslide area) to the result. Amazingly exist, internationally regarded only rudimentary knowledge about the faunal colonization of glacier aprons and many other newly formed primary surfaces,. In a cycle of research the Department of environment planning of the Hochschule WÃ¤denswil takes therefore since 2007 of this issue. The more than two kilometre apron of the Morteratsch Glacier at Pontresina GR as well as the new landslide above Goldau SZ serve as model regions.
