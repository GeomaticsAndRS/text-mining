Dentin being mechanically eroded and degraded, respectively, can be at least partly repaired by active odontoblasts if the compromised dentin is located close to the pulp. This cell type can differentiate in vivo from odontogenic stem cells, which can be found in adult human dental pulps and possess a self-renewal capability and differentiation ability in vivo. Strategies in vital pulp therapy using pulp progenitor/stem cells and the scaffold of an extracellular matrix might act as an alternative to the removal of the whole pulp by maintaining the function of a tooth. The present project is focused on the investigation of the suitability of various biomaterials as carriers for biomolecules and their influence on human dental pulp stem cells (DPSC). Thereby, it is of importance to enhance the tissue formation and hence the regeneration. Ivoclar Vivadent AG developed a newly bioactive rhenanite glass ceramic, which is bioresorbable and osteoconductive with biomimetic structures and uniquely functional properties at nanometer-scale.
