In the framework of this project, the aerodynamic properties and the absorption of energy the wind turbine of the agile wind power company examine AGILE wind power Ltd which would like to Zurich University of applied sciences. This coefficient of performance to are recorded in function of the number of fast running and therefore the performance characteristics. Continue to be the mutual influence of the individual turbine blades each other analyzed and optimized, if necessary, the positive effect of mutual interference.
