Problem statement: International studies show that cancer patients are often dissatisfied with the information received. For patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, the situation is especially challenging, because several different treatment options available. The aim of the project is to make a contribution to support the communication between clinically active and patients suffering from curable prostate cancer. Method: The acquisition of information needs is based on a method that for cancer research at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada was developed by researchers of the Institute. While patients judge 92 items in relation to the question, how important these have been in the process of decision making to the therapy. The study population consists of patients, what 3 to 24 months previously have received the diagnosis of prostate cancer in clinical stage T1 or T2. In addition, the attending personnel (urologists, oncologists, nurses, Radiographer) to their information priorities is questioned. The study is part of an international project, in which 12 countries involved and is funded by the cancer League Switzerland.
