BR Center for graphic data processing e.V. (ZGDV), Darmstadt br Czech Technical University (CTU), Prague of br COSMOTE, Athens of br ARCADIS Consulting GmbH, Darmstadt a European research project of the Hochschule Wädenswil MUMMY is the English word for Mummy, but the shortcut for a European collaborative research project in the programme (information society technologies) of the European Commission, which optimized Tablet PCs and other portable devices such as PDAs and mobile phones for mobile management of knowledge is. Data and information generated by buildings or the maintenance of HVAC systems for review, should in the future either automatically or through simple and concurrent input by pen or language directly on-site at the portable computer digitized and sent to central databases. The scarce and expensive commodity is knowledge no matter where and when it is produced, safe like a mummy against unauthorised access. In addition to facilitate data entry, E.g. in the standing with a Tablet PC on the arm, user, device - and situation-specific knowledge with rich multimedia processing technology is a central goal of MUMMY. Thus it is possible to use knowledge from central sources locally. Further, the graphical processing of information is a guarantee that people with limited computer experience can be integrated at all into digital workflows. The role of the Hochschule Wädenswil in MUMMY is central. The HSW, with an already heavily service-oriented understanding of facility management, collects the business and user requirements for the development of technical services, implemented the computer applications for the FM on the basis of generic software and performs tests and trials. The acceptance of the developments on the market attempts to ensure the HSW in addition through the early involvement of potential customers. In 2004, the first pilot projects be started with Swiss FM service providers and software vendors.
