EPFL Project Objectives: - Development of validated mathematical models of dye-sensitzed solar cells that describe the coupled spatially distributed processes (optical, electrochemical, charge- and species transport). - Accelerating R D by implementing models using efficient and accurate numerical algorithms. - Development of a graphical user interface to allow efficient usage of the models by solar cell researchers. - Identification and quantification of the loss mechanisms in the photovoltaic energy conversion by comparing experimental data and simulation results. - Supply DSC models to support material and DSC development and enable a model-based characterisation of DSCs.
