The cantons and municipalities turn off mainly in their accounting on the so-called harmonised calculation model (HRM), which was published by the Conference of cantonal finance directors as a recommendation. It is the knowledge of the late 70s and early 80s according to, but no accounting standard that expresses itself fully to the principles of proper accounting and authentic governs issues such as the consolidation and evaluation. The Conference of cantonal Finance Directors is therefore planning to undergo the HRM of a fundamental overhaul. This development should focus on the IPSAS (cf. KTI project IPSAS). With the creation of General Accounting and financial reporting principles including the accounting and valuation • appear on the existing standards and the common practice in the HRM • on the relevant IPSAS • referred to the preparatory work of the Confederation and the cantons involved. • created a draft of a new regulation of the HRM. In a group, the acquired results are presented and then discussed.
