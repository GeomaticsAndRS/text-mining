The quality of dental implant surfaces is important for the integration into the surrounding tissue and the time course of the wound healing process responsible. Three tissue types, which are based on three different types of cell, coming with the implant surface in contact and determine the integration process significantly: keratinocytes, osteoblasts and fibroblasts. In the carried out in vitro study were three different implant surfaces with regard to adhesion, proliferation and differentiation characteristics of the three cell types participate examined.
