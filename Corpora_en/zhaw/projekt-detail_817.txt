Ability Switzerland AG problem: patients with Central neurological disorders are often not independent. The walking function recovery learning is often only possible with repeated and intensive training which provide automated speed training equipment. The acquisition of this auto mechanical equipment by institutions such as hospitals or nursing homes but is omitted due to high costs. Question: Can an automated gear exercise equipment to develop, which is cost-efficient, safe and effective? Methods: Development of a functional pattern for a primarily mechanical electrical, foot-plates-controlled speed training device. Expected result: developed prototypes (prototype) a speed coach for the treatment of Gehfunktions disorders in patients with Central neurological diseases. The project was successfully completed.
