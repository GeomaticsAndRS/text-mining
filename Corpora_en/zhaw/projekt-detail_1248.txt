The aim of the project is to develop of a methodology for the study and control of biofilms in cooling lubricant systems for the metal-working industry. Biofilms are the most common form of life of many micro-organisms. Because they occur practically in any environment, they be combated in many areas. Controlled biofilms have but also beneficial functions (E.g. water purification). Both apply to cooling lubricant systems, it is missing but so far appropriate methods as a basis for a necessary control.
