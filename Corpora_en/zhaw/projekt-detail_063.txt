On the roof of the linth-arena sgu (Sports Centre with indoor and outdoor swimming pool, multi gym, climbing wall, restaurant, hotel, sauna, fitness, etc.) in NÃ¤fels (GL), a PVT - and a PV system with one is Electr. Capacity of approx. 230 kWp installed. The PVT part of the plant generates heat in addition to electricity. This heat is used to preheat the heat pumps ground water. Through this combination, the solar modules achieve a higher current yield and the heat pumps require less power. The P D project operating experience collected during 5 years with this new type of application. Evaluates the yield of heat and electricity from the PVT modules to be able to make statements about the economy and recommendations for future applications. The P D project is financed with contributions by the Federal Office of energy (SFOE), Canton of Glarus and Meyer Burger AG, Service7000 AG, Glarner Kantonalbank.
