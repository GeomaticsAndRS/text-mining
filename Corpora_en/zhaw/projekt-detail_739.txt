On behalf of the Department of training of the ZHAW was commissioned for the first time the Center for WIRTSCHAFTSINFORMATIK (ZWI) in 2007, to evaluate various educational portals, which were used by the different departments of the ZHAW as a medium for illustration and marketing their training products (MAS, CAS, WBK). On these results based and to the presence of the ZHAW as Gesamthochschule on the most important portals to ensure that manages and coordinates the Department training maintaining various portals. The further evaluation of the educational portals should indicate whether any adjustment need in terms of education portals that central training are maintained by the Department, there is. This includes recommendations, to what extent the currently maintained education portals continue to centrally maintained and whether new (additional) education portals should be included in the centralized maintenance. In addition an evaluation model, or grids should be developed and applied, which should also be used for subsequent evaluations in the coming years.
