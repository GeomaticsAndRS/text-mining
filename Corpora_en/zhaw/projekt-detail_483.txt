Scenarios of future spatial development periurbaner landscapes are developed in the WSL - research programme "Space demands of man and nature". With representatives of the case study areas, workshops are conducted where the drawn up development scenarios are visualized in real time. This allows an assessment of (unexpected) consequences for biodiversity and quality of life. In subsequent workshops, developed scenarios, taking into account of their possible consequences are again evaluated and, if necessary, revised.
