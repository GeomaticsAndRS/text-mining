About 50% of people around the world live in cities and consume much of the energy produced globally. Cities therefore offer a large potential for energy efficiency measures and an appropriately important role in the energy revolution. Building on earlier findings are bases for a scientifically based approach "Smart City" elaborated and developed appropriate transformation processes. System-scientific approaches are in the foreground. Also be appropriate technologies for smart cities, as well as their potential for linking analyzed. A concept is understood under the term "smart city", which is to allow cities to use smarter use of information and communication technologies, infrastructure and resources (E.g. energy). The combination of various technologies, E.g. in the building sector and the energy supply plays an important role here. Objectives of the project are: to develop identification and analysis of appropriate technologies and technology portfolio for "smart cities" identify drivers and barriers to the development of "smart cities" as well as design of an appropriate transformation process a better understanding of the concept of "smart city".
