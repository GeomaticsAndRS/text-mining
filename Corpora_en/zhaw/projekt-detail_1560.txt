Given the huge amount of static and dynamic contents created for eLearning tasks, the major challenge for their wide use is to improve their retrieval and accessibility within Learning Management Systems (LMS). The LT4eL project will tackle this problem by providing Language Technology based functionalities to support semi-automatic metadata generation, for the description of the learning objects, on the basis of a linguistic analysis of the content. We will employ ontologies to structure the learning material within LMSs, by means of the descriptive metadata. These functionalities will be integrated in an open source LMS. Another feature of the project is that we will provide these functionalities for all nine languages represented by our consortium, which includes some of the commercially less attractive ones. We will thus support the linguistic diversity of enlarged Europe by contributing to the dissemination of eLearning contents for these languages. The validation methodology suitable for investigating the impact of these new functionalities on the learning experience in a multi-lingual context will be provided. The integration of these functionalities will facilitate the construction of user specific courses, will allow direct access of knowledge, will improve the creation of personalized content and will support decentralization and co-operation of content management.
