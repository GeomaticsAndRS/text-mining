Grob Aerospace (D) this project dealt with an aerodynamic study, an aircraft manufacturer gave the Center for aviation in order. The task consisted in the development of new wingtips for a light business aircraft, with the aim to reduce the total resistance in flight. First, a preliminary optimization with efficient and effective method of analysis was conducted to identify the most promising success Fl√ºgelendgeometrien in the shortest time. One of this geometry was selected for further development. These included an optimization of wing profiles at transonic speeds and validation calculations at different Mach numbers and angles of attack by Navier-Stokes.
