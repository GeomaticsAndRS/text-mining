: 01.06.2009 the Swiss Association for social policy (SSPA) is a non-partisan Association, composed of professionals of social policy and that would inform neutral as well as increase the quality of the debate in the social policy. The SSPA with the question of how you can sensitise young people to the issue of social policy is turned on us. We have a platform for open educational resources designed and implemented this on the basis of a media wiki. Here, subject matter and didactic implementation notes are made available teachers. The already existing online encyclopedia social policy of SSPA was integrated into this wiki. Like at Wikipedia teachers can receive not only equipment, but bring also their teaching materials and widen as the offer of the wiki. The Swiss Association of social policy is above party lines Organization (SVPS), which consist of pundits in social policy, which inform neutrally and improve the quality of the debate in social policy. The SSPA approached US asking how young people could become ac-quainted with the subject of social policy. For this reason, we developed on open education resource and verifications on a me-dia-wiki base the project. Lecturers are provided with specific contents and how they can use these in class (didactical advice). There what a small lexicon developed by SSPA which what fully inte-grated into the new solution. Similar to Wikipedia, teachers can not only download material but so upload their contents.
