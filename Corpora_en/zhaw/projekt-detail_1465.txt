The micro reactor technology, which is a continuous reaction control, allows very short mixing times and a fast heat exchange through a miniaturization of the mixing zone. That formed no hot spots and to defined retention times with a narrow residence time spectrum, we achieved so much better selectivity and yield for a chemical process. The main objective is to examine chemical processes with this new synthesis technology and to determine the most important parameters and to optimize
