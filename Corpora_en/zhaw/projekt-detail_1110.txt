Low-frequency magnetic fields from a certain strength induce electrical currents that cause acute nerve and muscle stimulation may be in the body. Weaker, thus acting magnetic fields, there are indications of increased risks for diseases such as childhood leukemia. In addition to these risks there are in Literature a number of remarks on therapeutic effects of low-frequency magnetic fields. In recent years, such devices in the form of mats for the private sector are available. About magnetic fields and their effects, there are only a few details which indicate rather strong magnetic field exposure. Nerve and muscle irritation can be excluded, if the magnetic fields of the mats do not exceed the limit value recommendations of the International Commission for the protection from non-ionising radiation of ICNIRP. The project therefore aims to compare the maximum occurring on the surface of the mat magnetic fields to measure and with the ICNIRP limit recommendations as reference. A further aim of the project is to review the functioning of non-implanted heart pacemakers that are exposed to the magnetic fields of the mat.
