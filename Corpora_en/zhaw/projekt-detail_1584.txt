The R project for statistical computing IDPmisc contains various complex graphics capabilities designed specifically for large data sets as they always are in the air hygiene: pairs - and Lagplots, in which instead of single points, point densities will be represented. Plots of very long time series, which may no longer fit on a single screen. It can be expanded easily by the time series or automatically multiple graphic pages can be created. Multiple time series can be placed one above the other easily whereby whenever two different scales can be selected for the left and right Y-axis. Wind rose plot for circular data and grouping possibility. In addition, the package contains several useful utilities for creating graphics and programming, including fine-tuned color palettes to the representation of densities and intensities; a function to draw arrows "Ã¤stetischeren"; a zoom function for 2-D images; a function to remove invalid and infinite values from data.frames; a function to the selection of data, even if the logical operation returns some NA values; etc. Further there are two functions which are interesting for spectra and time series: find determination of the baseline of a range of peaks and shoulders
