Swissfiber AG supports the company Swissfiber in the development of noise-protection wall supports made of glass fibre reinforced plastic FRP group. With the new profiles, LSW noise barriers can be created conveniently and efficiently, which present great advantages over conventional materials through their high corrosion resistance to weathering and leakage currents.
