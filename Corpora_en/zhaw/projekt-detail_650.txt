The energy requirements for the insulation of external walls bring the solid construction systems to the limit. Plastered exterior thermal insulation, has despite supposedly good energy balance to a low life cycle, it is artistically limited and ecologically questionable. The traditional brick masonry in turn can, due to material, do not combine the high insulation values despite innovations with good support and noise behavior. The Thermokunststein aims to resolve the cons in a radically simple way. He will provide heat and sound insulation technical top marks without having to accept static losses and remain cost-effective in production and maintenance.
