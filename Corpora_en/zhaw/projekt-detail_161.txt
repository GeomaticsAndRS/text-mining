The Federal Council has set the entry into force of the new regulations for the financing of pension funds of public authorities on June 10, 2011 on January 1, 2012. The facilities should be removed also legally, organisationally and financially until the end of 2014 from the management structure. Within the framework of the provisions of this law, at the time various cantons deal with the funding of their pension plans and the associated accounting figure under HRM, HRM2 or IPSAS. Due to lack of recommendations (E.g. under HRM2), the Institute of administrative management commissioned the ZHAW to assess variants prepared by pages of the cantons whose HRM2 conformity, as well as to answer the subsequent questions within the framework of the opinion.
