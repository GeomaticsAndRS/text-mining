Sustainable development cooperation: the example of Kenyan small-scale farmers. Falling prices for agricultural products make to create not only Swiss farmers. Innovative approaches are therefore needed. Innovative marketing, new products and new sales channels are important for the Kenyan small-scale farmers. Macadamia nuts are the new product of the farmers. The product so far known in the Switzerland is the "bread of solidarity". The name comes, therefore, that in the knowledge of all involved a solidarity contribution levied, which will be returned to the farmers in the form of health projects. As a practical implementation of the health part of the project, the "Mount Kenya health days" were carried out in 2001 for the first time. (For details see www.macadamia.ch) The project is unique because while improving the economic situation of the farmers through an additional product, reduces the social pressure thanks to the medical and the environmental situation improved by the developed organic farming methods. The project is sustainable in the best sense of the definition. When do you support the Kenyan small-scale farmers by ask for the 'bread of solidarity' in your bakery or make when buying macadamia nuts on this symbol? As a service provider, the ZHW collaborated in this project.
