Extensive logs from the ongoing process control (IPC) were available ZÃ¼hlke engineering manufacturing process with very high requirements to the final product. Due to the very high quality of the final product was the effort to review the adherence of the AQL (= accepted quality level = proportion of defective products) too high: it must be wound each a very large number of randomly selected units from the total production, which were destroyed in the review. In addition, non-compliance of the AQL would have caused the subsequent destruction of a very large lot. The aim of the project was the assessment of still attainable AQL of the IPC data. This should allow the production process without to optimize complex AQL checks. The challenge was to use the temporally correlated data of the IPC, to get a statement about the quality of a random sample from the lot. After an analysis of the distribution of Probenahmezeiten in the IPC and the occurred partly censored fault lengths, the manufacturing process was represented as simple Markovmodell with the 4 state transitions for the production unit as a whole: good - good, good - bad, bad - bad, bad - good. The good agreement of model simulations and the actually available data from the logs allowed us to estimate the expected AQL from the simulations.
