We want to develop a software‐instrument that allows the evaluation of any questionnaires for a new coherence analysis developed by us. The instrument allows a user-defined similarity provision of individual data by choosing the weighting of Fragebogen‐items as well as the respective distance function. The self organized clustering based, non-parametric analysis of coherence can make then novel statements using this similar provision to the record, that are not possible using classical methods (ANOVA, regression analysis). In particular variability and stability of classification of the record can be investigated, which is important in particular (but not only) for social science issues. Accordingly, this research is embedded in an already existing cooperation between the University of Zurich (moral research), the University of Bern (political science) and the Zurich University of applied sciences (simulation and data analysis). Proof‐of‐concept of the determination of similarity and consistency analysis is carried out and successfully been applied to the statement by party divisions in the Swiss political system. A research context is chosen for the development of the tool, in which one of the currently most complex questionnaires of empirical social research - the world values survey - as a starting point for the development of the software‐tools is taken.
