EWZ overall objective of the project is to encourage the use of urban wind energy and thus to contribute to the electricity production from renewable energy sources. The offered project should occur in the city of Zurich, with following targets: identification of potential areas for wind energy use in the city of Zurich determination of wind resources in the areas of potential identification of the potential for wind energy use in the city of Zurich identification of suitable sites creating design concepts for the implementation of urban wind farming projects in the city of Zurich sustainability project documentation/recommendations the results of the research project will initiate investments for further implementation projects and represent an Enscheidungs - and implementation based. They serve as a means of communication and base for an optimized site selection with appropriate adaptation of technical design and spatial possibilities for sustainable wind energy projects in the city.
