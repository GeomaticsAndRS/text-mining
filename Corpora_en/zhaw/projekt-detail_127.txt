: 01.04.2014 current LCA are an essential basis for the scientific and comprehensive comparison of the environmental impact of various power generation technologies. The low environmental impact (for example carbon footprint per kWh) are an important argument for the expansion of wind energy in the Switzerland. However, the available factual balance sheet information for Swiss wind energy are partly obsolete and the conditions in the Switzerland not adequately adapted. The project aims to develop the LCI data base of Swiss wind energy fully and perform eco balance evaluations to electricity from existing and future wind turbines in the Switzerland.
