Nateco, Gelterkinden; greenmanagement, Zurich; d.b.g., D-Berlin Falkensee spaces are now planned and realized, without requiring specific considerations for later, decades of management. That creates high costs to maintain, in a comprehensive consideration of the entire life cycle (planning - implementation - management - decommissioning) would have been avoided. This project developed a management tool, in which the life cycle is taken into account by green spaces. New plans and existing plants should be with this system after use, ecological and economic aspects (costs) planned, evaluated and implemented. Enabling sustainable projects. Since summer 2010 is an executable software (GreenCycle) for calculating the life cycle cost.
