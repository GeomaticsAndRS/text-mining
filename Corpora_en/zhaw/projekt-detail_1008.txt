The section of environmental biotechnology teaches, advises and researches in the field of bio-gas since 1994. It methods and equipment in laboratories for teaching, services and F E projects are available. However, no facilities are available on a pilot scale. In teaching, in service contracts as well as in research projects a demand for anaerobic pilot and experimental plants, which market independent and flexible can be provided. In this context, the Institute of biotechnology (IBT) together with the Institute for environment and natural resources (IUNR) the construction of a biogas plant in the pilot scale (5 m3) on the campus of Gr√ºental of the ZHAW plans. The biogas plant will cover the entire process chain from the delivery of waste biomass processing and fermentation to the production of organic fertilizer and the exploitation of biogas. The plant will have display - and training character, is a modular and should offer in the later operation various research and training opportunities, which are related to the production and utilization of biogas.
