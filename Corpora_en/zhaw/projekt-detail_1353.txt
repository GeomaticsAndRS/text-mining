A change in the legislation as a result of the latest revision of the CCG requires the introduction of uniform and cost-oriented tariffs in rehabilitation until 2011. In this PC, project was therefore a patient classification as the basis for calculating rates developed in the rehabilitation. It was easily measurable patient characteristics that explain the rehabilitation effort to determine. In a longitudinal study in 7 rehabilitation centers, different patient characteristics and the cost of the rehabilitation were raised. Due to this collection, a model was developed for the determination of fare levels. Data were collected on total 1600 patients in the areas of neurological and Musculoskeletal rehabilitation, and early rehabilitation and work-related rehabilitation. The cost of therapies, doctors and care was charged for each patient. In addition, we covered the consumption of drugs, laboratory, diagnostic, material and other costs. The treatment effort with the independence in everyday life, Comorbidities and other factors can be explained as a result of this project. Total PCS explains significant 60% of the variability in the costs. The project was successfully completed. Recognition of the ZHAW awarded the project for outstanding interdisciplinary research: dependent rates in rehabilitation.
