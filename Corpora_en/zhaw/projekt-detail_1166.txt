ABS Investment Management This report takes a look at the landscape of Swiss funds of hedge funds (FoHF) in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Since April/May 2007, when we compiled the first comprehensive study about the Swiss funds of hedge funds (FoHF) market, the industry has changed substantially. Nevertheless, with around USD 275 bn in assets Swiss FoHFs still represent an estimated 25% of the global hedge fund industry. The basis of this report is the web portal hedgegate (www.hedgegate.com) which has established itself as THE information platform for Swiss funds of hedge funds. hedgegate has been authorized by Finma as an official publication organ. Swiss registered FoHFs are completely covered by hedgegate, thus in this report we concentrate on this segment. Over the last two years the coverage of offshore funds has intensified, but is not yet broad enough to be included.
