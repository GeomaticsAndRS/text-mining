Conceptual transfer concerns the complex process of conceptualization of themes, which include the Organization and "Languaging" of knowledge and knowledge transfer. Once in training contexts, for example in multicultural educational contexts, as well as translation and interpretation processes, aspects of conceptual transfer should be didacticized, it faces difficult methodological and didactic questions. Learning how to "work for a text(re)Produktion between languages", requires a re conceptualization. Is the use of the - varying - resources of the KommunikationsteilnehmerInnen questions of transfer processes in multilingual contexts and the intercultural language teaching in the foreground for us: how are individual by the learner, culturally determined, as well as external resources developed and appropriately Functionalized. Equally interested in questions, which in an academic context role to the "plagiarism" in transfer processes. Publication: honor Berger-Dow, Maureen Ulla Kanaka (2011).
