The job stress index reflects the ratio between resources and stress in the workplace, the exhaustion rate expresses the degree of stress and loss of energy, and the economic potential shows the potential production gains for the Swiss economy, if for all workers, a balance could be achieved by loads and resources at the workplace. The University of Bern is responsible for the calculation of the figures on job stress and exhaustion rate, the WIG is responsible for the economic evaluation.
