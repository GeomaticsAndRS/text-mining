The PWG Foundation commissioned the Institute for facility management of the ZHAW, to review the concept of operations for the leasehold improvements "the viaduct" within the framework of a rough analysis. There still not recognised, appropriate procedures and tools for facility management in the construction process at the beginning of the order, this was addressed in the framework of a research and development contract. Aim of these studies was to develop a validated want, which can be used for facility management through all phases of the construction process at various stages as: • tool for the control of the current planning status (security for the builders and the planning team that the relevant aspects have been taken into account); • Makes communication in the planning team, which everyone can understand statements and mandatory actions can be derived • Quality assurance tool which can be used by third parties. The first stage was to implement this for the rough analysis and design phase of the project "in the viaduct". The ongoing second phase aims at the evaluation and improvement of the established monitoring tools. The third stage aims at the further development of monitoring tools for further phases of the construction process.
