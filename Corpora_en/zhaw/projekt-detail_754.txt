The proportion of data that exist in a format (E.g. XML, HTML), defined by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), is increasing in technical translation. Many translators have little knowledge of these file formats and technologies. This leads to errors and delays in the translation process over again. The manufacturer of CAT (computer aided translation) W3C file formats support software on the other side for years. In addition to a more or less clear representation of the data for the translators make tools in their applications available that help the user (here of the translator) • the text to be translated clearly can represent • the files in the entire translation process on formal correctness (well-formedness and validity) can check because of the above knowledge residues at the end user these tools but not be used to the extent, how it would actually be expected. In this project, the various CAT tools should be evaluated tool manufacturers in regards to functionality and usability. Materials are developed based on the results, which should enable the user quickly to acquire the knowledge necessary for the use of these tools.
