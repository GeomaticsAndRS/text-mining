To evaluate the desorption behavior of iLoad coated textiles in a biological system, the penetration to be displayed by evening primrose oil as a sample substance the human epidermis. As pieces of human skin tissue are difficult in the procurement and comparability, Epidermisäquvalente should be used. Different commercially available epidermis models show significant similarities to the natural tissue morphology, lipid composition and biochemical mark er expression (Netzlaff et al. 2005). As an analytical method to determine the penetration depth of the evening primrose oil, the non-invasive Raman used spectroscopy. Tfayli et al. (2007) comparative studies showed that the epidermis model "Epi Skin ®" is suitable to track the penetration of pharmaceutical substances. In 2001 have Caspers et al. demonstrated that the Raman a promising method representing spectroscopy to analyze the molecular composition of the human skin as a function to the distance from the surface of the skin. The Institute of chemistry and biological chemistry of the ZHAW has the infrastructure and knowledge, to examine the penetration of evening primrose oil from the iLoad system on human models of reconstructed epidermis (RHE). A Raman spectroscope at the disposal is the "Functionalised materials and nanotechnology" group and the group "Tissue engineering and human cell culture technique" has the knowledge of human tissue cultures and their processing.
