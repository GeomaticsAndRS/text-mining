The canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden has approved the wild quiet zone "Southern Appenzell hinterland" in 2011. To have an argumentation basis for future discussions about usage restrictions, the cantonal administration bodies involved want to examine the effect of Wild Sanctuary. The project is planned for a period of 8 years (two NFA periods) and focused on grouse (module 1) and wild ungulates (module 2). Specifically, the following aspects to be collected: - traffic on roads / routes, as well as compliance with the Wild Sanctuary visitors - use facelifted habitats by grouse - courtship behavior of the grouse in relation to human activities, Habitat use by wild ungulates in relation to human activities; Comparison of potentially cheap used with actual areas - observability of wild ungulates
