Swiss Academy of Humanities and social sciences target and method on behalf of the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences was the level of research in the field of health with a focus on the social sciences in the Switzerland charged. A systematic analysis of the databases by FORS (Swiss Foundation in research in social sciences), ARAMIS (information system the Swiss Confederation) and the database of the SNSF (Swiss National Fund) was conducted for this purpose. The search results were analysed first qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, experts in the field were interviewed to database analysis results to validate and complement. It was found a heterogeneous distribution of the social sciences health research on many individual researchers, institutions, findings and conclusions, which miss a focus leaves from expert point of view and the construction of a critical density of competence in the field of health research more difficult. This is in particular at universities (except in psychology). The practice-oriented \ outcome - and Evaluationsforschung\\\ therapies and interventions was assessed by several experts as national little researched. In addition to the universities are social competencies in the private offices of research and at the universities of applied sciences. With the further development of the universities of applied sciences with their health departments is to be hoped that the defendant research gap in the area of "Outcome - and evaluation research" in the Switzerland can partially be closed and it comes increasingly to specialized centres of excellence. Is important for the social sciences from expert point of view, that she are increasingly team in networks, in particular in interdisciplinary with the medical sciences health research introduce or join with each other better together.
