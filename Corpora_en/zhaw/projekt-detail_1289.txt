Merck KGaA, Darmstadt the dye solar cell technology has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of photovoltaic cells due to their simple principle. Despite the successes in recent years in increasing the solar efficiency and the sealing of dye modules via glass solders a clear cost advantage not showed up with the existing Standardzellaufbau so far of dye solar cells over existing thin film solar technologies. The overall objective of the project is to develop economically on scalable cell on flexible foils and thin glass substrates to demonstrate, as well as for these concepts, new materials and synthesis methods and concepts to optimize. Starting from the technological level of the electrolyte-based dye-sensitized solar cells, the work in the project are aimed to enable the industrial production of very low-cost dye solar cell in the future.
