In connection with the structural measures to expand capacity of the highway road tunnel Baregg, the construction Department of the canton Aargau extended Verkehrserfassungs - and traffic control systems. This measures aims, among other things, achieving a possible homogeneous flow of traffic on the entire route which can be maintained permanently through proactive, predictive traffic control measures also in peak hours. Forecasts of traffic or the traffic levels are a significant contribution to the achievement of these objectives. The stretching area to consider is as far as possible, to detect changes in the volume of traffic at an early stage. It covers the sections of the A1/A3 on the area of the canton of Aargau in Switzerland, where the main focus is placed on the route between junction A1/A3 (Birrhard), the Baregg tunnel, the canopy of new farm and the Limmat Valley area. Forecasts for traffic-related information such as the traffic volume/density or the traffic level create, visualize and integrate into the existing traffic management system, the Institute for data analysis and process design (IDP) developed a specification/concept. While aspects such as placement of detectors, measuring data evaluation, characterization of the route, to use prediction algorithms, as well as the visualization were considered among others.
