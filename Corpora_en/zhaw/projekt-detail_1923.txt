Fuel cells are a promising technology for the realization of heat power cogeneration plants. The advantage of compared with a conventional technique is its low-emission and low-noise operation almost without moving parts. The underlying electrochemical process is however complex. It includes in addition to chemical reactions, heat and charge transfer and diffusion and flow processes. Accordingly, the interpretation of such systems is a challenge for the engineers. The problem can go on using modern numerical simulation tools. The program of SESES allows user friendly numerically to simulate complex systems of differential equations. Developing the HEXIS fuel cell to market to are supported within the framework of the project after a period of expansion through close connection by simulation and experiment effectively.
