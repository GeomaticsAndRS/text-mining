ItkA! is an interactive software that supports task - and problem-based learning. Students should be encouraged through this learning software to the independent acquisition of knowledge. Tasks and questions are categorized according to the taxonomy of Benjamin Bloom divided into different learning levels. In the free area of the exercise the students can decide independently which topics and which taxonomy level he wants to practice. The tasks are collected depending on the selection criteria by random system from a database. Lecturers can activate tests for certain chapters and learning levels. While editing a test the learner will be informed constantly about his current level of performance. At the end of each test block, he receives an evaluation of his performance, as well as the course average. The so-called "battle of knowledge" is a playful variation between training and test. Case studies available are for the acquisition of knowledge at the highest level of learning (synthesis, evaluation). Case studies have a game character; a distinction is made between the gold-oriented case study (collection of gold crowns) and goal-oriented case study (reaching a last question). ItkA! is an empty vessel that can be filled with any content in different modules. The usage is especially efficient when several project partners each jointly develop a module and use. Currently, three task modules are developed: materials, food, and household appliances. ItkA! was by Dr. Wolfgang Sahoo (dipl. oec.troph) designed. Contact: claudia.schmucki@zhaw.ch
