Vollparametrisiertes simulation model to the planning support in the area of performance guarantees. The model is used for performance enhancement and border service discovery in a current project, it should be used but also in future in the area of sales promotion. The responsible planners of the customers want in the future independently put experiments in the Simulator and evaluate. The maximum performance in the Commons before zone with the monorail should be determined. Another target is the peak performance. Different strategies, driving data and layouts are stored as parameter for the model. The interplay of these parameters and the influence on the targets to be determined dynamically in the Simulator. The model allows not only the passing of parameters for the simulation model using the Excel interface. Whole track layouts and various paper guides in the HRL before zones can be defined via Excel. The Planner can arrange with the model, without knowledge of the simulation, a variety of simulation models in the modular concept.
