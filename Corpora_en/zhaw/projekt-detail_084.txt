VSGP is slightly more than half of the tomatoes consumed in the Switzerland from own production. To meet the demand in the year after Swiss tomatoes for a possible long period, produced this winter from until spring in heated greenhouses. The heated (winter) tomato have a worse life cycle assessment compared to non-heated (summer) tomatoes. However, other dimensions of sustainability were not included in previous studies. In this study, both the LCA and the social balance sheet of Swiss, Italian, Spanish and Moroccan tomatoes through primary data collection in selected companies will be investigated. At the same time the study should reveal something about the eco-balance of the ever more common substrate culture method compared to the natural resources.
