KIARA aspires to improve the state-of-the-art in multiple ways: - Improves developer productivity and greatly simplifies application integration. - Dynamically and transparently selects the optimal communication mechanisms, protocols, and data representations to be used between two peers. - Embedded compiler dynamically at run-time generates highly optimized code that transfers messages directly from application data structures to the network. - Simple, high-level specifications of QoS/QoE and security requirements - KIARA uses a Secure By Design approach for of the communication architecture
