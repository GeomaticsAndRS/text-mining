Ideally, all for and around the ZHAW should produce, films and videos have consistent visual elements to maintain and/or strengthen the CI of the ZHAW. The IAM created the concept, first design proposals for the appearance of the cinematic elements mentioned, would follow up the implementation and created the necessary instructions to apply the cinematic elements in the sense of the CI BBÂ´s of the ZHAW. The focus will be on the design and production of four cinematic elements here: 1 a a single (or personalized) intro 2 credits, depending on the Department individually changeable is 3. a template for a Cummerbund/name be Blender 4. a uniform text table (or multiple versions) this film elements should be easily accessible for all departments.
