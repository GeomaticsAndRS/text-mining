The SML International blog regularly reports on the study of students at the ZHAW School of management and law. In addition, the blog provides a platform for Exchange students - incoming as outgoing - who share your experiences in a foreign environment. The Office for the new learning implemented the WordPress open source system for the International blog and since then supports the students in technical matters.
