Distributed energy stores play a central role in the supply of buildings and quarters with renewed from renewable energy sources. Storage systems to compensate for short-term but also seasonal fluctuations in production. The project creates an overview of thermal and electrical storage systems in Geb√§udeclustern (neighbourhoods and areas). The storage systems are characterized efficiency, environmental compatibility and technical integration to integrate them optimally in districts with decentralized power generation facilities. A konretes area of AEW in Reinfelden is examined here.
