The project "Knowledge management" (1999-2001) had the aim to create an overview of ZHW-skills, projects and networks. It comprised 3 sub-projects: 1. analysis of dealing the ZHW members with the resource of knowledge using a self-developed College-specific questionnaire conducted over 70 interviews with representative Wissenstr√§gerInnen at the ZHW. The discussions evaluated since autumn 2001 in an internal report are available (see intranet ZHW internal projects) as a basis for action. 2. development of an internal information platform intranet the intranet portal has been developed in accordance with the previously established information needs of members of ZHW and turned up in the March 01. This comprehensive online information platform with news, releases, documents, forms, tools, applications and useful links was greatly expanded in the fall of 2001, and again in the spring of 2004. 3. building ZHW - expertise databases (ComPage) the original approach to the acquisition of teaching skills was realized in an altered form: A portrait of employees on the ZHW homepage, that pulls together information from other databases (projects, publications, continuing education courses) as well as personal information about education and training and so dynamically creates a competency profile. The concept of Kompetendatenbank in the form of a new project expert pool was further developed in the summer of 2004.
