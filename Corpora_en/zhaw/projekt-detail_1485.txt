The aim of the research project is to develop of a novel robust planning methodology for production planning in SMEs. Through the use of fuzzy planning objects to reduce the susceptibility to errors and reduces the amount of data maintenance. The approach is implemented and integrated as a module into the EasyProd environment of Federer AG. The practicality of the new concept will be tested on the basis of two pilot companies. Thus a production planning environment designed specifically for SMEs by the type of shop floor is designed, which is characterized by robustness and ease of use. The Institute for data analysis and process design (IDP) works in this project together with a consortium of industry and the Department of business engineering (IBE) of the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland.
