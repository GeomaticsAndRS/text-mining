The knowledge of current and expected travel time is an important basis for optimal traffic management for highway - as well as other high-performance lines. In the framework of this project, a new method will be developed which allows to estimate the travel time between successive counting stations on the basis of individual vehicle data. In the studied networks, the maximum distance between the count is 13 kilometers. Further, multiple entries and exits, where no data are available from these lie between the counting stations, between which the travel time should be estimated. The procedure assumes that at least the length of the vehicle and the time of the passage of the counting stations will be collected. These are data, as supplied, for example, by the commonly used double induction loops. The developed method is applied to simulation data as well as on real measurement data. The simulations are performed with the micro simulation tool AIMSUN NG Â®. Under the condition that the procedure meets the requirements of the rice time estimate, thus offers following advantages: (i) is working with a technology, which individual vehicle data collected in sufficient accuracy, no additional installation requirements are necessary; (ii) as opposed to other processes such as the automatic number plate recognition, the procedure allows no inference on individual vehicles, is completely anonymous; (iii) are more characteristics of the vehicle such as class, height, width etc, can these easily integrated in the process and achieve an improvement of the accuracy of the statement.
