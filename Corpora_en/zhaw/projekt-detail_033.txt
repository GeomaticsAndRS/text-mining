Siemens Switzerland AG in conventional interlocking systems is the energy supply of the interlocking building over several kilometres distant control and monitoring devices track over point to point connections. The energy efficiency of these cable-intense - and therefore expensive - compounds is often not ideal. In the project of SIgrid (smart interlocking grid) developed an innovative, intelligent power supply system, which is based on a bus or ring structure for the supply of the actuators and systems. Used as the system components, decentralised energy short time memory cover peaks in demand and allow the realization of long point distances. In addition to the highly efficient use of energy has the saving of copper wires in addition to economic and environmental benefits and allowed it to dampen the rising infrastructure costs.
