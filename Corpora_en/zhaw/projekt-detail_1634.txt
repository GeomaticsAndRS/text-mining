Because the investment in a virtual memory concept appeared high and extensive operational changes pushing the introduction of such a concept, the Institute for applied information technology of ZÃ¼rich was commissioned Hochschule Winterthur, an analysis of the proposals and concepts that were in connection with the storage virtualization of the city hospital Triemli, to make. To order also belonged to assemble a catalogue of points so that the former concept could be further improved.
