Paneco is to be developed for the Thurauen an application for smartphones, which leads visitors through the floodplain and relevant, location-specific information is available. The information is intended to alert visitors on special features, which can see them in their current location or perceive. The app non-linear provides information tables available, but in their connectedness. Thus the dependencies of various elements are needed each other in relationship, in this way to make more comprehensible the "system Thurauen". Floodplain areas are habitats with exceptional diversity. For this to be possible, conditions of various kinds must be met (biological, chemical, physical, and social). Such relationships can be recognized by those who directly and indirectly experience the Thurauen as a "System". "Things" in the Thurauen are usually perceived by visitors: gravel benches, bluff, Beaver trees, half-open forests, neophytes, etc. The cybernetic functions, the roles which take these "things" in the system Thurauen are far less recognized. To do so, the connections between the parts must be recognized and not the individual parts separately. It becomes apparent that a part of the system in one case is a regulator in the other case a sensor or even a buffer. This realization is central in understanding the nature and its functions. The project "App for the Thurauen" wants to create a step-by-step and expandable extension to. So, the purpose of such applications is from pure hiking and rather random experience observing and understanding to lead. With the Smartphone app a visit can also be prepared and forth existing plans can be included in the nature centre.
