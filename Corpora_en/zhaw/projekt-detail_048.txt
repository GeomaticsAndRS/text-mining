Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is an important Commercial Enzyme, being used most recently in industrial applications that involve kinetically-controlled Synthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics in an environmental friendly process that replaces chemical processing. The design and set-up of an efficient, industrially viable System for PGA production is therefore of great importance. The proposed SCIEX-Project deals with optimising the production of PGA in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris, with the aim of acquiring an in depth view of the production process by studying the physiology and behaviour of the host strain.
