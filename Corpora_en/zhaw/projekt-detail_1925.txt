The aim of the project is the development of a hydraulic buffer for rail vehicles. Using modelling and simulation should be speed up the development process, reduces the number of prototypes and customer needs accurately implemented. The new development that is different compared to the commonly used hydraulic capsules through fewer moving parts and the different management of hydraulic oil, represents a major challenge for all partners.
