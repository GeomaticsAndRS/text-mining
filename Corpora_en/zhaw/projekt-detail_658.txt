The greatest challenge facing the world today is climate change, requiring the development of new solutions. Europeâs Leaders have committed to a 20% reduction in Carbon Emissions by 2020. This requires new solutions and partly drives the EU âNew Jobs-New Skillsâ Agenda. Adoption of Green Roofs offer a wide range of benefits from value to biodiversity, providing extra insulation, extending the roof life, helping to cleanse the air of some dusts and pollutants, moderating the urban âheat island âeffect, slowing the storm water runoff, creating new open space for relaxation to name but a few. They contribute to reducing carbon emissions but require new skills. A significant supply side barrier exists; traditionally the construction of roofs has not required specialist horticultural expertise. Therefore there are very few people able to install and maintain a green roof. While the technology and material resource exists, skilled labour does not. The project will address this situation directly by exporting the technical expertise and knowledge required into the UK. The project will develop Level 2 (Technician) and Level 3 (Supervisory) Qualifications and gain accreditation so they become sustainable publicly funded provision first in the UK then Europe. The project has six main aims: The design, development and pilot, leading to full UK accreditation of a Level 2 âGreen Roof Techniciansâ and 3 âGreen Roof Supervisorsâ Qualifications. Design and develop training resources to support curriculum delivery of these qualifications. Build a vocational partnership capable of promoting and disseminating these qualifications. Support VET for Green Roof throughout partnership countries. Help stimulate supply side growth in the EUâs potentially most demand led market the UK. European accreditation for qualifications
