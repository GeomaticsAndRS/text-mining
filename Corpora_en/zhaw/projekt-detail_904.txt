Linda Thomas, school of Arts and Humanities at the Goetheanum what wants the youth of society? "A COMMUNITY CLEANING CONCEPT FOR SCHOOLS" want to answer this question with "A meaningful task!". Vandalism is a big problem. The majority of communities complains about littering. Amounting to several million Swiss francs damage annually in the public space. Different ways these to respond to problems, whether through information or even repression, proved little effective. The project "A COMMUNITY CLEANING CONCEPT FOR SCHOOLS" is an alternative, sustainable way. It relies on the participation of young people in the central support process of purification of the schoolhouse. In various pilot projects at Waldorf schools, this concept has led to a better hygiene and less damage to furniture and buildings. It also has a positive impact on the social skills of young people. It offers the possibility that young people, in addition to the ubiquitous virtual in the real world can assert themselves and get involved physically.
