The âMobility Lakeâ project aims to develop a cross-border, sustainable mobility concept for tourism and leisure activities in the Lake Constance region. The Lake Constance region is a tourism and leisure time destination with special characteristics. The surrounding four countries provide versatile nature and cultural aspects, but also create a demand for cross-border cooperation when it comes to mobility services. Mobility is necessary for recreation and tourism in the region, but it can also have a negative impact on the recreational value. Due to goals for CO2 emissions reduction, scarcity of resources and energy transition sustainable mobility is becoming a central topic in the political and social discussions. Especially nature-orientated tourism destinations such as the Lake Constance region are facing new challenges. The challenging situation also leads to new opportunities, since a well-functioning mobility system is currently and in the future necessary. A concept of âSustainable Mobility in the Lake Constance regionâ does not only bring additional value for the locals and tourists, but also gives a chance for the Lake Constance region to establish itself as a model region for new mobility solutions.
