The research group Envirogenomics and system biology, focuses among other things on the Molecular Diagnostics in the biological and the conventional crop production. One of its objectives is the development of field-grade nucleic acid tests, so-called molecular point-of-use diagnosis that implies the diagnosis on the spot. The development of corresponding assays, as well as the necessary, field-grade equipment covered by this project.
