The goal of this project is the development of an anti-glycation active substance for use in skin care products. The reaction is described as glycosylation of sugars with lysine side chains of proteins. Because the proteins, thereby losing their activity, glycosylation long term leads to the damage of the tissues. Several, carefully selected plant extracts will be tested as anti-glycation active ingredient. Extracts due to the combinatorial possibilities of action are of particular interest as opposed to isolated substances. The effect detection of the extracts should be in cell culture assays. A 3D skin model co culture will be developed to optimize the detection that has the characteristics of a diabetes skin. The analysis of protein will provide information on the exact mechanism of action of plant extracts.
