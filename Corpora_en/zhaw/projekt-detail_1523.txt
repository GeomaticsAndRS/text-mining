It is estimated that the cost of treatment in patients with chronic low back pain make up less than half of the total cost (direct costs). The largest part of total costs indirect costs (namely 60-75%) with sickness absences and di pensions for chronic disability cause. A study already carried out showed that functional rehabilitation reduced the sickness absences in the first year after treatment. In this study, it will be investigated whether the function-oriented rehabilitation has a positive effect on the cost in the second and third year after disease outbreak. The project was successfully completed. Publications:
