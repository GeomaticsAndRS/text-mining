EC motors are used as actuators in various areas. They run moment -, RPM -, or Positionsgeregelt. In the control, the motor position information is collected and used for a suitable power supply. Algorithms were developed in the project to which the current ideal properties of the engine to adapt to, and thus a better efficiency or better motion properties to create. The algorithms were implemented on a microcontroller that is often used in this area.
