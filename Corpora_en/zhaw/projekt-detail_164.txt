University of Cape Town, which green and clean technologies in the food production really worthwhile and contribute effectively to an improved life cycle assessment? To answer this question, this research project is examining the life cycle assessments of major South African agricultural products and quantifies the achievable potential for improvement through the use of greenTech and cleanTech. The project results can then serve as decision basis for targeted use of these technologies. The African eco balance sheet records developed in the project will be published in a database and can be used in other research projects.
