Atherosclerosis is a pathological change in the arteries of a chronic constriction of vessels takes place (stenosis). This restriction applies to the coronary arteries, there is a deficiency of the heart muscle (myocardial infarction). From a certain degree of arteriosclerosis the necessary supply of the heart muscle can be restored only with help of a bypass operation. Applying of natural bypass requires massive surgical intervention. New, innovative strategies are trying the complex operation carried out as minimally invasive. In cooperation with the University Hospital of Zurich, an anastomotic device, device for connecting two vessels is developed, which simplifies the sewing process. Instead of manual sewing a Helix needle is rotated semi-automatically with embossed thread through the fabric to sew the bypass gently on the coronary artery.
