foresight study aims to identify key success factors for a sustainable growth of the European Transport industry and for policies which can increase the transport industry's strength in a long perspective up to 2050. By integrating the current comprehensive foresight know-how into a comparative synopsis, we will gather and assess various visions and policies. The results of the analysis will be discussed with experts from the transport industry, research, policy and the foresight field. Through the comparative analysis and discussions weighted explanations and long term concepts for a sustainable and competitive transport industry can be created.
