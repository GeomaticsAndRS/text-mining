The Kafi is one of the most common and most serious gang image disorder in children with cerebral movement disorder. This gait pattern and its consequences are clinically well documented. The causes and consequence are but, due to their complexity, until today, not yet fully understood. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of an artificially generated knee flexion on the foot. This allows a statement about the impact of knee angle to the joint positions of the foot while walking. The modern equipment of our laboratory of movement allows you to measure the kinematics of the lower limb. We understand better gait of cerebral paraplegic children through the application of the Oxford-foot model (OFM), by the normal course and the artificially created Kafi response compared to each other. The OFM is designed for objective detection of foot deformities and has increasingly established itself during the last years in the clinical application. The data from this study are also used for the survey of course standard values of this age group and of OFMs. The project was successfully completed.
