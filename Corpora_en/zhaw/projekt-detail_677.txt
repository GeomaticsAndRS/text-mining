In public and even in circles of the ecological value and the ecological potential of nature-based and professionally maintained golf courses is still too little known. The Genossenschaft Migros ZÃ¼rich GMZ would therefore sift habitats on the perimeter of your project and integrate the golf facility design under consideration of ecological aspects. Knowledge about behavior and movement patterns of recreational water users will be obtained also by means of targeted Besuchermonitoring. This information is used as the basis for a customized visitor management.
