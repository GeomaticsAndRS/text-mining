in air / inNet AG in an area of 5900 km2 are 15 stations which record the concentrations of various air pollutants with a temporal resolution of 30 min. Thus only a few specific details of the measuring area are available, which reflect the current state of the air. However, emission maps are available for this area describing the NO2 and PM10 year averages on the basis of physico chemical models as a function of location. The physico chemical model used would have to be expanded to the reliable prediction of short time averages, but disproportionately. On behalf of in air or inNet AG, a robust procedure was developed which allows a prediction of a daily average value (almost) anywhere in the in-air area through combination of immission model and currently measured concentrations. These data were analyzed several years. For the investigated locations, which represent different, typical locations, it found a simple correlation between daily and annual averages for NO2 and PM10. Through the inclusion of additional air-hygienic knowledge, ultimately an appropriate card for the ozone hourly average values could be calculated.
