A person's accent and pronunciation are important aspects of their identity. Beyond the desire to be well understood, German learners also have deeply personal reasons for improving their phonetic skills.

It will teach and test both theoretical knowledge and practical skills including essential phonetic phenomena. (Status = eingereicht, September 2014)
