Lyme disease is a tick-borne the species Ixodes disease, which is widespread throughout the world. It is caused by pathogenic species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In the context of the CTI project a new will be developed Multiplex (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, group of spotted fever rickettsia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum) real time PCR for the detection of three important groups of pathogenic bacteria from ticks and patient samples. Strains of Borrelia and Anaplasmen are isolated from the collected ticks and patient samples using cell culture, with consecutive establishing of their own tribes as new products for the serological and Molecular Diagnostics. This allows a reliable diagnosis of all relevant tick-borne infections in the Switzerland in connection with the production of recombinant antigens.
