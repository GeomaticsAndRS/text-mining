The institutions in the disability sector, from historical development here on the problems faced by younger people with disabilities are focused, are the problem becoming aware. Attempts to deal but often rather unsystematic and characterized by gaps that are necessarily should be drawn up. The proposed project will contribute, by systematically existing age concepts in the field of disability for the canton of Zurich and identifies gaps and deficiencies in the existing concepts of age. The content focuses on the interaction between institutional care and private networks for the elderly with disabilities. Starting from the basic thesis that private networks for people with disabilities from the age represent a largely untapped potential, the institutional retirement concepts are critically examined, described the potential of the network on the basis of secondary analyses and from persons with disabilities regarding the development of private networks in the CV analyzes selected biographies. This is entered in particular on the importance of private networks at institutional changes (home admissions, defectors, residential groups change etc.).
