The metabolism laboratory of the screening Center at the Charit√© is responsible for newborn screening in Berlin. Here, each year 30,000 newborns are examined. The screening is done with a tandem mass spectrometer, which at the same time the concentration is determined by over 60 different amino acids and Acylcarnitinen. Because the sophisticated method was first introduced a few months ago, many questions of quality assurance were open, which we systematically went on with the lab: short - and long-term stability of the MS, stability of the samples, possible errors in the sampling, possible errors in the analysis. In addition to General statistical considerations especially robust smoother and complex graphics were used for the visualization of multi-dimensional relationships.
