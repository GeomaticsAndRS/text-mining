Pädagogische Hochschule Zürich (PHZH) in the Swiss day school landscape can be seen an accelerated increase in day school places. Political and public debate increasingly calls the training and building of day schools. A quantitative expansion is required, this is confirmed by various demand analyses. But hardly explored its pedagogical design and framework conditions were so far. The evaluation of "day schools and day structures of the city of Zürich" - a contract research of the education and Sports Department of the city of Zurich - would like to close this gap. Objective of the evaluation is to generate control knowledge to the development of student clubs and day schools. The evaluation includes the parents survey, the survey of principals, teachers, and caregivers. The first perspective is captured by the Research Department of the Department of social work of the ZHAW, the other by the University of Zurich. The evaluation in the period from autumn 2009 to autumn 2010 is realized. In the survey of parents, all parents will be interviewed by day school children as well as children of the city of Zurich student clubs. The data collection carried out questionnaire to General as well as specific assessments to day schools or student clubs, to assessments to the caregivers as well as to the use of the services.
