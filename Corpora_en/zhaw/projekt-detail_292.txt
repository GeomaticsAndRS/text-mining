The Red Deer is in many parts of Switzerland on the rise. Locally and temporally he can reach very high densities, especially in winter cost areas. In search of foraging deer reach more and more in the winter in valleys and cause significant conflicts here (E.g. due to damage to agricultural crops, through negative effects on forest regeneration in protected forests or by accidents). This problem was particularly accentuated in recent winters in the region of Werdenberg, where packs with up to 120 red were observed. In response to this development an intercantonal research project is to be built in the Eastern Switzerland, that thoroughly examines the biology and ecology of the red, as well as the diverse interactions of this species with the people in today's cultural landscape. Objectives: A representative number of Red Deer will be captured and equipped with a new telemetry system. Thus the space of these animals is to track (GPS-GSM transmitter) and physiological parameters measured (rumen probe for the measurement of pulse rate and body temperature). Valuable basis for a targeted approach to the Red Deer resulting in combination with information about the landscape structure, food supply and usage, as well as human activities.
