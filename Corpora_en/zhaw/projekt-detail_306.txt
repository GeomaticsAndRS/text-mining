Floors are suspected to be source of antibiotic resistance. This is especially the case for soils where manure is applied. Although previous studies on very few genes and locations were limited, they have shown a connection between floors and health risks. A deeper understanding of the existing soil pool of of resistance - is therefore urgently needed for one in connection with the microbial communities, on the other hand with the environmental conditions affecting the abundance of resistance genes. The project aims for soils, which are typical for Swiss agriculture, describe the variety of antimicrobial resistance, and evaluate the effects of management practices on the dynamics of resistance. The research team designed Sequenzierungsmethoden for the total DNA of the soil with the aim to hold the Metagenome each for conventional and organic farming and natural ecosystems. Methods of Bioinformatics (bioinformatic mining) should allow to identify the genetic makeup of the resistance and to identify the genetic variants, as well as the origin. The team also investigated the influence of soil properties and soil changes on the diversity and the development of antimicrobial resistance. The project will close a major gap in knowledge in connection with antimicrobial resistance in the ground and thus make a contribution to the Antibiotikapolitik.
