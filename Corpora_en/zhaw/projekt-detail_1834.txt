in air in air operates a data warehouse for the evaluation, distribution, and archiving of the air measurement data. All archived data are adjusted by the measured gradients, automatic measuring system messages, and the station journal are spotted. Such a Visual review of all data is expensive and very tiring for the person carrying them out. Also, the data which are automatically published for topicality reasons E.g. via Internet, usually only subsequently undergo a plausibility. In this work, proposals for automatic finding of eye-catching ozone, NOx and PM10 values were developed, which are easy to implement in eta. Striking values are referred to in this context, which properties strongly from the expected differ and are therefore potentially flawed: the most noticeable problems it will be however not faulty data but special air hygiene events, that only professionals can identify. The implementation of the procedure allows an expert to focus especially on these eye-catching places at the plausibility of the air measurement data in the future. Thus, it can at the same time increase their efficiency and reduce the risk of error-prone places to be overlooked in the data.
