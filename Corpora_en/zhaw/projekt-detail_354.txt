At the time, protective cultures, which largely work on displacement, acids or antibiotikaverwandte substances can be found on the market. The here used Starter culture makes other substances, which may also inhibit the multiplication of pathogens. The inhibitory mechanism is explored in the context of the proposed project. Following a process optimization is performed, which reveals increased the inhibition by Starter culture of Leuconostoc citreum connected with an increase in the production safety.
