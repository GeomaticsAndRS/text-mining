The IAM has evaluated on behalf of Greenpeace in a two-stage study the Member magazine "greenpeace". A questionnaire for the subsequent quantitative survey has been prepared on the basis of a qualitative product evaluation by using of Leitfadengespr√§chen with Greenpeace members. Recommendations for the further development of the Member magazine against the background of all Member communications could be drawn up on the basis of the results.
