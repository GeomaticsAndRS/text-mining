In the framework of this project, a process will be developed for establishing a hepatitis B vaccine of the third generation. The culture conditions for recombinant animalen cells in terms of productivity have been optimized at the Hochschule WÃ¤denswil. Furthermore, a Kryokonservierungsmethode for the cells while preserving the vitality and productivity will be established. You are attracted to established cell banks of Berna Biotech AG, as well as on the HSW on the ZHW in reactors and reactor conditions for vaccine production to be optimized. Another part of project on the ZHW deals with the development of an appropriate preparation process to isolate highly pure vaccine from the cell culture supernatants of the reactor runs. This is to achieve a high efficacy and reproducibility under conservation of immunogenicity. The biotechnological production of recombinant proteins in an industrial scale must comply with the regulatory requirements for bio-safety and quality control. The quality of the vaccine is checked at the ZHW by bio-analytical methods both during the process and the end product.
