Building on the structure of the study "Biogenic good rivers of Switzerland" are bound pollutants collected data and information on biomass, associated with pollutant flows from other sources in context and substance flow analysis represented as. The study, which is conducted on behalf of the Federal Office for the environment (FOEN), focused in on - drawing up an overview of existing data sources to bio-mass-bound pollutants in the Switzerland - the assessment and listing possible sources, entry paths and lowering of organic pollutants and heavy metals in biomass. -the detailed consideration of this pollutant flows in the mega-processes 'Agriculture' (crop, livestock) and "use of disposal" (fermentation, composting, processing energy). -the comparison of these pollutant flows with those of mineral fertilizers and other agricultural goods assistive products. -the description of open data gaps in terms of pollutants in biomass. -Development of recommendations on the closure of the data gaps.
