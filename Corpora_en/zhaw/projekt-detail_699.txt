Dr. franc Wagner, University of Lucerne in the Internet use a paradigm shift has taken place in recent years: the primary purpose of use has shifted from the information gathering and dissemination to the communicative Exchange. The communicative use - among other aspects is also used - the construction and the maintenance of social relationships. Although the Dialogic use of language in the new media has been analyzed so far little systematic, the really new is just for writing in new media. The language resources are used in unusual contexts, new language features, and innovative forms of communication will be tested. These include new communications constellations, such as that unknown about private things interact. Familiar parameters of social orientation, such as old-age and status differences, are repealed at least at first glance. Identities and roles must be negotiated only by the communicating. When writing an own path between universal conventions must so and found a personal style (cf. Wagner 2008). To come new conventions of language dealing with each other, how about civility rules (Chatiquette) or a military culture (see small Berger GÃ¼nther 2002) new. When communicating in new media, extends existing skills and new skills acquired (cf. Wagner small Berger 2009). To examine these forms of linguistic innovations it is not enough to consider isolated linguistic phenomena, but it has to be explicitly involved the embedding of the texts in the social and situational context in the analysis. The linguistic Constitution and evaluation of social relationships in the dialogical communication should be focused as a focal point.
