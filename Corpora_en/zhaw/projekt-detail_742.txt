The new regulation of hospital financing was decided 2007 within the framework of the revision of the KVG. These dictates future performance-related packages for the in-patient health care, based on national uniform structures. Performance-related need to be developed for the institutions in the field of specialized palliative care packages. The ZHAW team developed a patient of classification system (PCS), are deal with which performance in inpatient institutions for palliative care of Switzerland by 2015. The PCS to a) be a simple and practical system and minimise the documentation effort, b) be as free as possible of perverse incentives and manipulations as possible off - close, c) suitable for coding be revisions, and d) in the sense of a 'learning system' continuously can be adapted. Method and results: Development of a procedure for the random weekly selection of patients. In 300 cases, data of patient characteristics that potentially explain costs, and cost data are collected during a week. Then it is parsed, which patient characteristics and what clinical assessments are suitable best for the prognosis of the care and treatment costs. The result is a PCS performance rates in the institutions for palliative care with a minimum number of assessments and simply to gathering information.
