Blood donation src Switzerland AG issue: the demographic ageing in the Switzerland is also the supply of blood and blood products before new challenges. On the one hand you will recruit the donors and donor of blood more from younger age cohorts. At the same time, the consumption of blood and blood products in the older age cohorts rather accumulates. This supply can gaps, which should be recognized at an early stage so that appropriate measures to ensure the supply of blood and blood products may be taken. Objectives: The development of the supply situation with blood and blood products for the Switzerland will be investigated for the period 2010-2035. In the foreground are the inclusion of demographic trends, as well as trends in donor recruitment and the transfusions (blood patient management, etc.). Methods: The study is a combination of panel design and demographic forecasting. Individual data basis data of blood donors (supply side) and patients (transfusion recipient, demand side), which are covered by the 13 regional blood donation services of Switzerland, as well as large clinics/hospitals. This can be age - and gender-specific donor and transfusion rates, which can be extrapolated to predict the development of blood collection and transfusion in combination with demographic scenarios of the Federal Office for statistics and ETS trend estimates (transfusions and withdrawals) in the future.
