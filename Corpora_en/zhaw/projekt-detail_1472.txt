The usage possibilities of acoustic distance measurement with air ultrasound for the detection of obstacles in automotive engineering (E.g. for parking assistance systems) are strongly constrained by the variability of meteorological conditions to be taken into account and the variety of disturbing signals from non-related reflectors, in particular from the surface. Variable sound velocity and sound absorption effect changes the time and amplitude scaling the commercial signal echoes and make high demands on the methodology of the evaluation of the signal. It is developing a concept to adapt the signal processing chain changing meteorological influences, while taking into account disturbing echoes of the underground.
