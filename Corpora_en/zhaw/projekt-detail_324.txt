ACW irrigation is often in the agriculture base for safe yields. In this project a sparing use of water resources and a reduction in nutrient and pesticide leaching to with a sensor-based control be achieved and continued to practice maturity. The scientific comparison of new technology with this practice common irrigation shall show the reduction potential of leaching and water consumption, as well as the impact on plant health and profitability.
