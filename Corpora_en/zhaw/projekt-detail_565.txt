You can find a complex composition of microorganisms in different areas. In addition to natural biofilms and the use of immobilized microorganism in wastewater treatment and waste disposal are mostly also food fermentations. In this project, MALDI-MS methodology as important tools for the identification of micro-organisms will be tried complex system on the example of cocoa bean fermentation and optimized. The Anwednungspotenzial of the MALDI-MS methodology will be increased significantly as a result.
