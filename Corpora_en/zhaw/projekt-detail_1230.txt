The vegetation mapping forms an important basis for construction projects, especially in high altitudes. You is used to (1) assess interventions in nature, (2) to calculate the damages, and (3) forms the basis for an appropriate back green. The vegetation mapping is very time consuming and can be performed only in a very limited period of time at high altitudes. The mapping work can be arbitrarily divided on different people, because on the one hand the matching among the different Kartierenden and takes much time to the mapping area, and on the other hand, knowledge of plants are needed. To reduce the overhead of vegetation mapping and to shorten the field work as possible, we want to develop a methodology before mapping using aerial images and GIS-based analysis of terrain. The combination of these tools, we expect to establish a meaningful and cost-effective before mapping, by means of which in the field mapping is easier. The methodology to the vegetation before mapping does not exist yet and will be developed with this project. Aerial photographs, various GIS data sets serve as a basis (terrain model, geomorphology, geology,...) and a vegetation mapping at a scale of 1:5000, which was carried out in the framework of an order by the ZHAW. Keywords: vegetation mapping, aerial photo analysis, GIS-based modeling
