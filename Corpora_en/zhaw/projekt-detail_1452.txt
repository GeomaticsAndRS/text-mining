: 15.10.2006 partners / project partner (s): V-ZUG AG, Zug the V-ZUG AG is planning a new Logistics Center (LoZ) at the site of train. With the planned construction of the existing warehouse to 21 039; is to 000 pallet spaces will be increased. Various system suppliers have developed different solution versions. The Simulator should dynamically secured the material flow concept elaborated by the system vendors. A simulation study to reveal the power and limits of the planned Logistics Center. In the Centre of the considerations, especially the given performance guarantees are under full load in the new HRL. To clarify these issues, the simulation used real-time data from V-Zug and the system provider. Goals - function demonstration of the planned system - determine the limits of the system, pinpoint bottlenecks and elaboration of measures to resolve - development of material flow control concepts - showing how the system under maximum load â€“ determine the utilization of individual system components, determine the effect of different amounts of scaffolding - influence of individual system parameters on overall performance targets - total time, all picking orders are carried out - number range of movements from the HRL - swap power average per hour - loads the individual conveyor elements (in particular RBG, Lifts, transverse shuttle, MA)-maximum occupancy of shipping loading bays
