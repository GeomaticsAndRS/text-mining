Simulation of fast transients (SoFT) in high voltage electrical networks requires suitable models of the networks components (motors, transformers, cables, etc.) which are valid over a large range of frequencies (up to 10MHz). Because such models are rarely available there is an increasing need to derive them from real measurements. Within this project, which has been nominated for a Swisss Technology Award in 2006, a dedicated measurement system has been developed for multiport components with up to 7 ports. Optimality properties of the measurements are achieved by iterative excitation on successively derived eigenvectors of the network component. A modelling package based on frequency domain vector fitting has been further developed with special attention on passivity an reliability of the resulting models. These models can be included in common simulation software as EMTP to anylse a networks behaviour in certain wanted or unwanted situatons as switching, short-circuit or lightning stroke.
