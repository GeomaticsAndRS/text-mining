Prof. Dr. Stephan Russ-Mohl, USI journalism researchers and journalists are bad. The latter accuse mediation issues of science, while researchers primarily use their peers and care little about a layman. The network of the European Journalism Observatory (EJO) does not simply accept these communication barriers, but actively support young scientists, to make results accessible to the Swiss media research of a wider public. In the democracy of a media company, it would be important that media report critically about media and thereby concerning at least sporadic scientific findings; Answers to questions are handled in many departments of media studies. This, the problem that media scholars usually hard pressed to to prepare their research results so that they are usable for journalists is but. Just the crisis perceptible media financing, such communication barriers should be overcome. Journalism researchers should communicate more and more understandable with potential users of their research - with journalists and media managers, with media politicians or media regulators. With the project EPICUR researchers of the Zurich University of applied sciences contact aims to make visible the Swiss media research in the German-speaking countries. The network of the European Journalism Observatory (EJO) and his ten-language Web site are a suitable platform for this. Young scientists conveyed in workshops, how to go to with their research results on journalists and also about the use of social media â€“ make it - accessible to a wider audience. In cooperation with the EJO-team of the University of Lugano also mediation services in English are being promoted.
