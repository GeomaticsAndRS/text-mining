Motorway traffic control measures such as ramp flow controllers or variable (time and space) speed regimes, including others on knowledge of current and forecast traffic conditions in the individual sections on the network that you want to be based. In practice, that is often only a limited number of counting stations to the local collection at the disposal problem. Also the fact that not all entries and exits measurement data are available complicates an assessment using conventional methods. This project still assumes a relatively "tight-knit" detector network with minimum section length of about 4 km. This represents a typical upper limit for macroscopic traffic models on the one hand, on the other hand this also roughly corresponds to the conditions of the test track from which this project data available are for us. The aim of the project is to develop of a methodology which incomplete counting places data in a relatively-detector meshed, statements can be made about the current transport State. To do this, macroscopic traffic flow models and used real measured data from different sources (local counting stations, FCD, etc.). Thus, a better understanding of the dynamic processes in the network will be won and thus better estimates of State and allows forecasts.
