This KTI project developed a universal voice control devices can be used to control any device by voice. Voice control is sprecher - and vocabulary-independent, i.e., it works without previous training for a new speaker and the vocabulary of voice control can be compiled dynamically at run time. For each connected devices must exist a driver file with all possible speech commands for the desired language. The voice control generates a command tree from all the driver files. The dialogue is with the user at any time in a node of the command tree, which is called the focus. Commands that emanate from this focus, can be entered directly. All other commands can be entered but still about the root of the command tree. Adopted on voice control, video camera, fax machine and telephone devices are connected: focus E.g. the telephone, so can all voice commands for the phone are entered directly, E.g. listeners take off or dial 0522677587. The video camera and the fax machine can be controlled but still: video camera recording can begin with the command, for example, the video recording will be started. Universal voice was already used for different purposes, E.g. for the control of medical equipment.
