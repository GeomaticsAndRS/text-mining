Over 100 fermentation plants and a variety of composting plants for treating agricultural outlets and organic waste in operation are in the Switzerland. These systems meet energy industry in General in addition to their role in the waste also a role in the disruption of sanitation circuits. Both anaerobic and aerobic processes a variety be inactivated at specifically but in process conditions, thermophilic, mesophilic of germs and vectors, which are potentially pathogenic for plant, animal or human being. As a result of new Cosubstraten, as well as the increasing complexity of the systems, it is however necessary to rethink the leaching of the plants. The study represents the theoretical potential of existing, i.e. on the Swiss market of offered processes and process chains to the real biowaste Hygienization. It shows potential vulnerabilities in relation to categories of waste, pathogen categories and process categories and evidence of optimization opportunities in management and operation.
