The muscular control of the lumbar spine is reduced in many patients with lumbar back pain. Clinical assessments are often used in physiotherapy. But insufficiently examined for their validity and reliability. Also, it is unknown whether a reduction of muscular stability of the spine in the context of physiotherapy can be treated effectively. Method: A first study examined the reliability of the video evaluation of 10 clinical trials for muscular control of the lumbar spine for 4 physiotherapists. To the physiotherapists watched video footage of the tests independently of each other in 40 patients. Another study investigated the stability of tests if these are repeated with an interval of 3 days. The validity of the tests is investigated in healthy individuals and patients with back pain.
