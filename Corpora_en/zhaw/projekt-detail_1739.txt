FUN-Alpin â Virtual Future: New Types of Alpine Landscapes Evaluating the resource bases of new economies for reshaping regional policy This project will investigate the effects of new economies and societal tendencies (the virtuality megatrend) upon the (socio-cultural) value and the (economic) valuation of traditional alpine landscapes. Changing social and economic value systems will inevitably lead to a changed balance between extra-alpine core regions and (intra-)alpine regions, but also the balance among alpine regions themselves will be affected. Therefore a reshaping of regional policy may well be imminent, with a strong tendency to differentiate between new emerging types of alpine landscapes, especially qualified Label regions .The intended main result will be regional policy recommendations based on the findings of this and other research projects in the framework of NRP 48. The long-term objective of the research results is a contribution to a sustainable development of the alpine regions.
