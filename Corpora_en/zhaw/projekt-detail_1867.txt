The client maintains a multilingual terminology database (TDB) with about 8000 entries for creating technical manuals and translations. The aim of the project was to work out with computer-linguistic methods, how consistent the terminology in the manuals is used and it is as consistent with the TDB. Using automatic term extraction and manual review, the relevant terminology in the manuals was determined and then processed with the help of Perl scripts. The resulting lists show deviations in the case and candidates to supplement the TDB and they reveal unwanted synonyms. So they give evidence of consistency gaps and enable a simple editing by the FachgebietsexpertInnen of the contracting authority. The project was completed after a period of four months by the end of May 2001.
