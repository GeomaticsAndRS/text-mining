The linguistic quality of texts online editors of SRF was at the Centre of the project. In the first part of it was to evaluate the whole text production in a weekend and detailed feedback to the editorial staff. On the other hand, the feedback was individually: selected editorial staff members selected their own texts, on which they then got a feedback in longer conversations and an individual strengths/weaknesses profile. It was just Grammtik and spelling as to style and storytelling.
