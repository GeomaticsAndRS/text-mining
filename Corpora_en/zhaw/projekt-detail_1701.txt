The development of industrial cell culture processes of recombinant proteins aims to reach high efficiency, reproducibility and predictability. Usually the time allowed for process development is rather short so that in recent years tremendous effort has been put forth to establish suitable online analytics. Although these established methods deliver useful data, they are incomplete since they deliver information of poor quality on cell metabolic state at the time of sampling and allow no predictions on their own. The newly developed ATP-Master will bridge this gap in the market. It is a well established fact that ATP is the driving force for the majority of biochemical reactions and therefore extremely important for cellular metabolism, identification of nonphysiological conditions in the reactor, production stops and cell death (Apoptosis or Necrosis). A novel online ATP measurement device was successfully developed within this CTI project. The new system established a cell internal ATP measurement based on luciferin-luciferase bioluminescent assays (Cambrex) with a new cutting edge analytical and fluidic technology The analyzer was successfully transferred and installed at Novartis Pharma AG in Feb. 2006, setting new benchmarks in development time for a new analytical system (In just over two years the idea was developed into a series-zero apparatus). Very promising and reliable results have been available since April 2006. For the first time itâs possible to monitor the metabolic state of the cells during the whole cell culture process and to eliminate stress factors and limitations sooner. Process development of industrial cell culture processes for recombinant biomolecules can be done more efficient with reduced costs and time leading to a competitive advantage for pharmaceutical companies utilizing this newly developed technology.
