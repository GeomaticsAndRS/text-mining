This project developed a novel technique for the characterization of multilayer coating systems (thermal material properties, thickness, etc.). The measuring principle is based on the optical stimulation of the surface of the coating system with a Flash of light and non-contact measurement of the resulting surface temperature history with an infrared camera. A mathematical model was created for the measurement process, which takes into account both the physical processes during the measurement and the technical characteristics of the measuring apparatus. This model could successfully be validated on the one with the results from a previous project and on the other with a FEM numerical simulation developed in parallel. Questions regarding Identifzierbarkeit of system parameters and resolution limits on photo-thermal measurements specified answered as technical requirements to the measuring equipment with the model. Based on the model created a sound and flexible software. Two robust prototypes were created. The prototypes are mobile, and were used for measurements with industry partners and in the laboratory of the ZHAW.
