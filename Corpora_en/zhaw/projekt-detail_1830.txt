Efficient heat power cogeneration plants can be achieved with fuel cells. Applied electro chemical process, however complex, is so the development is supported through numerical simulation based on finite element. To use model calculations on different levels of abstraction, System properties are calculated by means of simulation of three-dimensional areas and subsequently reused as effective parameters in 2D-Rechenmodellen. Thus, enormous savings are possible to compute time.
