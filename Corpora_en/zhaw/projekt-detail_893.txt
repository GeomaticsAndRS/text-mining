The demand for day structures and day schools for children and young people is very high in the Switzerland as well as in Western Europe and rising in the trend. In contrast however with the Scandinavian countries, which occupy a leading position in this regard, a low offer persists in the Switzerland, to meet this demand. Against the background of these findings, the school district of Cham launched the project "Modular day schools in Cham" two years ago. Currently four day schools are involved in the project. After two-year duration of the project, this project will be evaluated empirically to create a sound empirical basis for the political presentation of the arguments for the mandatory implementation of modular day schools. The evaluation is realized in the period from July 2010 to January 2011. The parents survey interviewed all parents whose children use school specials, general quality and satisfaction features, characteristics of satisfaction as well as demographic information with standardized questionnaires. The main interest focus is on the question to the General satisfaction of the existing offerings, as well as their use. Also, subject of evaluation is the question of development opportunities of the different offers. In its alignment, connect this evaluation directly to the current Schulqualit√§ts and school development discourse, and thus also contributes insight, which goes beyond the project in the strict sense.
