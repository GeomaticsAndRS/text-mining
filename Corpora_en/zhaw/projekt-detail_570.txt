In this project a new product is for working with microorganisms in various sample materials are developed, produced and placed on the market. It will be introduced by microbiological "control sets standards" in a new form. These standards include each canned, certified quantities of micro-organisms and have a long shelf life. Thus specimens can be inoculated standardized with a precisely defined amount of bacteria. The standards should be used as controls microbiological detection methods, interlaboratory studies and quantification of microorganisms. Because the discs directly and without further preparation (i.e. without culturing the organisms and without defined concentration setting) can be added to the sample material, the analyses are accelerated. Furthermore, using the discs increases reproducibility, comparability and safety the microbiological analyses. In addition the discs comply with new expected requirements about the use of control standards in certified or accredited laboratories.
