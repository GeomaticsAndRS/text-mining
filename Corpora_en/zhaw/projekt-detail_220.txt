Aim of the study is the cost-effectiveness, technical feasibility and - as far as judge at this stage possible - the environmental and social performance of wind energy on the areas of the SBB. A potential assessment of the potential installed capacity should be performed for these locations. Based on this data the potential yield and profitability can be estimate.
