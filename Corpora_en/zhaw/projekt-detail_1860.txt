In continuing vocational training is a need for greater clarity, transparency and permeability between the many different courses and training programmes and courses, so that the system meets the current requirements in business and society. Education providers, companies and Lernwillige interested in the recognition of knowledge and skills, even if they fit into the grid of the renowned language examinations (Cambridge, Goethe, Alliance Française, etc.). Only with a transparent and permeable module system, the unit can be used to avoid repetitions and overlaps and increases the efficiency of education and training. Smaller, more manageable steps with clearly defined final competences to promote lifelong learning. In this project, we tried to find useful ways to implement such a system. Our findings are based mainly on practical approaches tested often in real-life situations. So we could develop modules for apprentices in technical professions, for business students at universities of applied sciences, for a business information systems company, PrimarlehrerInnen, will teach English, for SBB train drivers in accordance with a systematic procedure. Our project was presented to a wide audience in the successful 'Language Works' Symposium at the Zürcher Hochschule Winterthur end September 2001.
