CONSUS is being developed in order to support agribusinesses in the process of creating sophisticated feasibility studies and making complex decisions regarding new direct sourcing projects of agricultural products in developing countries. A sophisticated planning process is crucial to achieving sustainable and profitable long-term trade relationships, which incorporate the needs of smallholders and local communities. The tool aims to support customers in increasing their production base, diversifying their portfolio, promoting sustainable solutions (e.g. converting to organic production) and seeking new supply opportunities through direct sourcing.
