Sweet cherry (Prunus avium) and sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) are major crops in Bulgaria and Switzerland. Cherry has both high-economic value in large and small production systems and high cultural significance to rural farms, landscape richness and heritage preservation. National germplasm collections of commercial and heritage cherry varieties have been assembled and characterized in many European countries. To date characterization has focused on traits associated with fruit quality and agronomic production. Very little is known regarding the resistance/susceptibility of these cherry varieties to potentially devastating bacterial disease. Identifying varieties that have high-quality fruit as well as disease resistance/tolerance is important for improving cherry production in a sustainable, low-chemical way. This project aims to apply next-generation sequencing in order to identify promising genetic markers for disease resistance or at least strong defense responses against bacterial pathogens.
