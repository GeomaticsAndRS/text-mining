The module includes thermodynamics expected seven modules with seven to nine learning units. Each lesson is divided into an introduction and a theoretical part. Test questions, practice, System Dynamics models and practice covers complete the learning unit. The production cost of the module Thermodynamics of approximately CHF 200'000. - to a third of the participating universities, the Eduard job Foundation and carried one or more sponsors from the business. A commercialization is not planned. Note to the methodological approach: the physics of dynamical systems based on the Karlsruhe physics course uses the system dynamic modeling technique and is based on the mathematical language of continuum physics. Main topics of this innovative access to the fundamental laws of nature are the balance equation, the role of energy and a possible comprehensive Canon of constitutive relations. The system dynamic modeling technique, which is used also in the economy or in the social sciences, allows the students to set up complex systems of differential equations, without being crushed by the mathematics.
