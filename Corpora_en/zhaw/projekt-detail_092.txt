Hofmann AG today are the production costs of electricity from solar cells for newly built, larger photovoltaic systems in the Switzerland under 20 cents per kilowatt hour. This is in particular the greatly reduced investment costs. Thus, the ongoing annual operating costs have become a central factor. You can make now up to a third of the production costs. A first examination of the operating and maintenance costs of grid-connected photovoltaic systems was carried out with the support of the Swiss Federal Office of energy (SFOE) about six years ago. The changes in the market in recent years, however, require a complete revision of the investigation. The ZHAW School of engineering as well as the Basel and Hofmann AG have accepted on behalf of the SFOE and in collaboration with Swissolar and BE network AG of this task. The objective of this work is the actual operating costs of photovoltaic systems to know the future development to estimate and a catalogue of measures to reduce the operating costs for the work. Cooperation with the ZHAW School of engineering in Winterthur the study gives a better effect and the results of surveys can be included directly in the classroom. In addition, it is planned that the activities on this topic over the project period will be continued
