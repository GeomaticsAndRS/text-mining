Background: Responsiveness, especially the protective responsiveness of older people are central to avoid falls. In the present study it was protective reaction assessment (PRA) developed protective reactions to the capture and tested on 30 people (age 70). Objective: the self-interest, convergent validity and reliability testing. Method: the test was developed in consultation with ten physiotherapy experts (face validity). The video recordings of thirty subjects (mean age (SD): 83 (6.6)) were then assessed by seven independent physical therapists. The self-interest was carried out using Rasch analysis. The convergent validity was determined by a correlation analysis of the total number of points in the mountain balance test and the total score of the PRA. For reliability, same video recordings were evaluated by six independent physiotherapists twice within 4 weeks. The Intrarater, the inter rater and the test-retest reliability were using FLEISS' weighted Kappa, Kappa and intra-class coefficients under the conditions of K≥0. 5 and IOCC 0.6 assessed. Results: According to the Rasch analysis of test ten of twelve tasks with a Chi-square includes probability of 0.023 (α = 0.05). A high convergent validity determined ((Spearmans rho = 0.812, p 0.01, n=30; 0.7-0.89=hohe Korrelation)...) The Intraraterreliabilität was mediocre in 6 of 10 items (K≥0. 5); the ICC of the PRA was sufficient with 0.65. The inter rater and the test-retest reliability were mostly weak (K 0.5). Conclusion: The PRA represents a valid instrument for detecting protective reactions in the age and can be recommended for clinical practice. To improve the reliability, the training of testers and evaluators must be more standardized.
