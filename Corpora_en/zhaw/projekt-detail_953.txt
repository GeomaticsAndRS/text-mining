Precipitates both wild animals and of man and his livestock included of course always endocrine active substances that enter the environment. However the amount of these substances has increased dramatically in recent decades. Reasons for this are on the one hand, the growing population and the increasing intensification of agriculture. On the other hand the potential effectiveness of the departing hormone-like substances has increased through the development and application of synthetic hormones (E.g. the pill). Human excretions are conducted mostly in industrialized countries with a floating sewer in a wastewater treatment plant (ARA). Various endocrine active substances are pretty well mined ARAs. The remaining residual concentrations in wastewater can cause but still in the waters errors in the hormone system of fish, because these substances are biologically very active. The entry path was discovered by urban waste water treatment in water and its possible consequences for the first time in the 1990s in England. It was examined by now quite well. However, the livestock has been investigated, although also a substantial source of endocrine substances, until today only in the UK. The Switzerland today several million animals living in cattle and cows of around 1.5 million. Alone they eliminated four times more estrogen in the sum as all 7.7 million inhabitants together. These reach the meadows with the manure. Of these, they can be washed then in the next waters. The requested project to illuminate on the example of estrogens by livestock in the Switzerland effect closer the possible entry of endocrine substances in water.
