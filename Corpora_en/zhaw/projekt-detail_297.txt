Energy storage are an important component of the energy revolution, which assumes a high share of fluctuating renewable energy sources in the future network. Today, the Power2Gas concept, which is based on the conversion of surplus electricity in chemical energy (production of gas by electrolysis), is the only known way for long-term storage, which can compensate for also seasonal generation and fluctuations in consumption. In the project RENERG2 all aspects and challenges of Power2Gas technology be studied, as E.g. electrolysis, power, influence of the mixture of hydrogen and natural gas to existing infrastructure, decentralized combined heat and power, efficiency possible solutions, etc. our part of this project focuses on the optimal integration of Power2Gas plants as long-term storage in electrical networks.
