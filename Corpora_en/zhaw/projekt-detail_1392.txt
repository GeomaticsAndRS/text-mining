The desire to reduce the risk of natural disasters, could lead to new criteria for the settlement, which does not coincide with the previous planning or even contradict this. With the preparation of hazard maps a field of planning conditions will be refocused in the Switzerland, which was for decades of minor importance for the development of the settlement. The aim of the research project is the exemplary presentation of strategies for settlement development, which increasingly take into account the risk of natural hazards. It investigates involve what spatial changes of natural hazards for the settlement area. We are looking for innovative and long-term solutions, which sustainably to reconcile diverging interests (further residential development and limit the risks posed by natural hazards).
