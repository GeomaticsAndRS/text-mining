The nature trail Kaltbrunn is an important local recreation area for the local population. The area will be upgraded in total quality and positioned as a tourist offer for day guests. The needs and interests of the indigenous population in the redesign of the woodland have been included through a participatory process. Based on the elaborated concept in cooperation with the open space architecture of Lucerne, a master plan with first implementation measures are created.
