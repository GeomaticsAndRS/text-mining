The international olive oil award - Zurich together with the OLIO - have aimed to strengthen the confidence of consumers in the product "Extra-virgin olive oil" and to promote transparency on the olive oil market. At the same time, the events provide a representative overview of the quality of the current offerings of olive oil on the Swiss and the EU market. On the occasion of the "international olive oil award - Zurich" are the participating olive oils by a trained specialist panel tasted (Swiss olive oil Panel (SOP), accredited according ISO 17025) and evaluated.

On the occasion of a Konsumentendegustation at the Gourmesse Zurich to the audience "OLIO", same oils by the consumer are blind tasted and judged by popularity.
