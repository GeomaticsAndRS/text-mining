Wolfgang Bischoff situation of Serapias vomeracea precedes in the canton of Ticino only in a few locations (MÃ¼ller et all., 2012). It is not known why young plants of generative reproduction are available at some locations and not others. All Orchid seeds are instructed at the germination obbligato tions on mycorrhizal fungi. The specificity of the fungi of Orchid seems to sein(Schneider et all., 2012). According to Rasmussen Whigham (RAS need to Whig-ham, 1993) the fungal activity and abundance within the research areas can the slide frame method fairly easily determine. Target goal of the approach is the rapid assessment of the 2011 established test fields on their ability to the genetic reproduction of Serapias vomeracea in the potential areas of the ProNatura project (Bischoff, 2010). This is a key feature for a permanent backup of the population in the new areas. This supplemented all potential sites and three active sites from the Serapias vomeracea Projekt(Bischoff, 2010) with the slide frame method. While seeds are buried (method after Rasmussen Whigham, 1993) and excavated again at a later time and evaluated.
