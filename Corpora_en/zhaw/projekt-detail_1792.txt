The project goal is to develop of a rapid and still accurate robot system. The robot will clearly surpass today's systems in accuracy and speed. Nevertheless, it should be cost-effective. Two almost identical prototype to be implemented: A robot with a harmonic drive gear and the other with direct-drive-motor. Speed and acceleration cycle min. 5 cycles per second - any position by mid workspace in 0.1 s accessible have. -EV. has the workspace can - be to navigate in 0.1 s goal: 0.1 m in 0.1 s capacity min. 0.25 kg incl.Gripper (Wunsch 0.5 kg) for fast movements 0.1 kg. Accuracy accuracy is required only in slow motion. -Resolution 0.0001 mm, 1 mrad - position correction 0.001 mm, 100 mrad - repeat accuracy 0.002 mm, 200 mrad - absolute accuracy 0.1 mm, 10 mrad
