NestlÃ© Research Center Micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) are a major public health problem in the developing world and particularly harmful during early childhood. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions with fortified foods for the reduction of MNDs in children. The study proceeds by answering the following questions: 1) Do the interventions with fortified foods aiming to reduce MNDs in children work controlled trials? 2) How big is the lifetime burden of MNDs in children in terms of life years and quality of life lost and in terms of lower productivity and healthcare costs? 3) How can we design cost-effective interventions with fortified foods aiming to reduce MNDs in children?
