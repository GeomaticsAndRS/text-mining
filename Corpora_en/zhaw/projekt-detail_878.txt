econimo drive Econimo drive AG developed generators, the electricity from fuel (E.g. M99 methanol) produce. This Econimo (energy converter integral modules) electric motors power the generators in different areas of application, from small to large. The procedure applied by Econimo drive basiert-on the Thermophotovoltaics. This intense light in the infrared range creates a first step by combustion of fuel. In a second step, this light is cast to the sunlight by means of special photovoltaic cells in power analog.
