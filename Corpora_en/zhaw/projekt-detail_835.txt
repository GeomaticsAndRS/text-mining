The capacitive measurement is suitable as a low-cost measurement technique to the online determination of water content of a water-oil emulsion. The chemical and physical relationships are in complex. Therefore, a formulation with analytical models is difficult. A neural network is a model on a statistical approach without following the claim of a precise scientific analysis. The neural network is able to produce a model relationship on the basis of data between the system variables and the size of a State by adapting the network parameters. The network was trained with a software Simulator and thus displaying the corresponding water content calculated from new input data. A simple measuring principle with an intelligent data processing delivers excellent results. Through the online measurement methodology it is possible to intervene at an early stage in the process deviations.
