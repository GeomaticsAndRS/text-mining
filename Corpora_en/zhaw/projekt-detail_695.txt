Professionals in the IT sector are essential for innovation and economic growth in the Switzerland. In addition to the lack of young emerging for years, innovative companies recognize that they are sustainable when they give women and men the same opportunities. Virtual forms of work can help the Club ability to work and family through temporal and local flexibility. The decentralisation of the teams promoted participatory forms of cooperation and work independently. In addition to the potential of virtual forms of work for a gendergerechte UN basis, these can be problematic as well. May blur the boundaries between work and private life, health and well-being are affected. Social contacts in the team change, and as a result the team cohesion may be lost. Direct communication with the management staff is decreasing and therefore lacks the personal support in difficult situations. There are a few implementation projects that have addressed the question of the virtual forms of work in the IT industry from a gender-specific perspective. The present project wants to close this gap. Together with IBM Switzerland recommendations are prepared for the gender structure of virtual forms of work, even with regard to the technological facilities, for service companies in the IT sector best practice, have character and can be used by other companies. The results of the project will be published in a booklet and provided an interested audience as a consulting and training of the Zurich University of applied sciences. The project lasts from September 2011 and August 2013 and is financed by the Eidgen√∂ssi between Department of Home Affairs FDHA and the Federal Office for equality between women and men EBG in the framework of financial assistance under the gender equality act.
