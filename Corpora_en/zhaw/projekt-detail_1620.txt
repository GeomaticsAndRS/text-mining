The importance and the potential of green spaces in urban residential areas for human health are occupied by various research and largely recognized by policy and planning. Even in the design of urban residential environments possibly ecological, aesthetic and representative solutions. Aspects of health promotion are hardly explicit attention in the planning as well as in the use phase. The health-promoting potential of these spaces is not sufficiently exploited, because among others planning Executive and use-oriented criteria and qualities with regard to health and well-being in practice largely missing and therefore not deliberately used. As a result of the study are examples of health-promoting Gr√ºnraumsettings and qualities as well as theses of criteria for their design and use. The study should help to integrate into future health promotion in the planning and use of urban living environments.
