In the production of Biotechnologically produced drugs and vaccines, a comparable change in the hospitals currently held about 30 years ago. The trend towards away of Sterilizable equipment made of chrome steel and glass, pre-sterilized components made of plastic, which are intended for single use only. Peristaltic Pumps used to pump liquids mainly, what strong usage duration and hydraulic performance limits are subject to. To avoid these disadvantages, a one time pump with magnetic bearing rotor should be developed. In the project, in particular the mechanical stress on the pump on animal cells and sensitive proteins should be minimized.
