On behalf of the Department of education ZH the ZHW researchers evaluated the success and the effectiveness of the project of English in the school project 21. With qualitative and quantitative approaches to research in applied linguistics (teaching observation, interviews, performance tests), the introduction of the teaching of English in 3 primary schools (each three 2nd, 3rd and 4th classes, about 180 children) was analysed and evaluated. The results of the November 2001 final report found strong consideration at the client's premises and in the media. The Zurich project is in the public spotlight, because the issue is still controversial after the first foreign language that should be taught in the Swiss elementary schools. The evaluation was carried out in close cooperation with the educational Institute of the University of Zurich.
