The aim of the project is the development of a simulation system for the optimization of coupling operations, the analysis of vibrational and assessing the collision safety of rail vehicles and entire trains. The simulation system to allow for the customization of existing train and printing equipment to customer requirements, are used in the development of new components (E.g. automatic clutch for passenger trains of the next generation), as well as all provide predictions with regard to energy consumption and collision safety compositions. The project builds on the findings of the project development of a hydraulic buffer for rail vehicles (KTI 4181.1).
