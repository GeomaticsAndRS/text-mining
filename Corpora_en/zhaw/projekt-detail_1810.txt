High-voltage motors, which are regulated by means of power electronics, are extremely vulnerable to any power surges. Using simulation it is possible to predict the occurrence of overvoltages and meet appropriate countermeasures already in the planning phase. So far, creation of a simulation model for a 3-phase HV motor for the frequency range 10 Hz however required several weeks of work of an experienced held up to 20 MHz. The idp has therefore developed an algorithm from measurements on the motor automatically generate a dynamic model that can be used in commercially available simulation tools. Thus, the time for the creation of a model in a day can be shortened. The methodology it developed an automatic model generation starting can be applied by data in principle on any linear systems in electrical, mechanical, thermal, etc.. Complex systems that are difficult or impossible to capture with traditional physical modeling techniques, can be mapped to easily in a simulation model.
