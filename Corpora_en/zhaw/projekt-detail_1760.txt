Because the participating libraries differ significantly in their main features, the basis for comparison is homogenized, by the libraries are divided into five groups (scientific libraries, study and education libraries, regional and city libraries, libraries with Filialnetzen and university libraries). To render long-term intertemporal developments through regular data collection. In addition, the project provides a framework for the mutual exchange of information the participating libraries. Once in a year, a meeting of library representatives and project management held for this purpose. In addition organize the above comparison groups if necessary meetings.
