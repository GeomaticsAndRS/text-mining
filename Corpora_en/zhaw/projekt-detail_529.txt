The aim of this project is to identify together with the local partners the regional potential of organic wastes and waste waters additional to animal manures suitable for biogas production and to identify possible locations for medium size plants on sites with small and medium size food industries producing biogenic wastes. In the current research project, biogas plants will be developed and adapted to the specific application and subsequently constructed in a second phase of the project. The project, i.e. this preliminary study presented.
