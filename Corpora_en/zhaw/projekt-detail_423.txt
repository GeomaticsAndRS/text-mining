Every year, millions of anastomoses are carried out in the human body. Today, such surgeries usually connect two structures by sewing these together. This time-consuming process burdens medical doctors, patients health care costs. The main goal of the proposed project is thus to develop a prototype of a novel microsurgical kit for easier, faster more secure sutureless anastomosis. Meteso (patent holder) requires research expertise in materials, manufacturing in-vivo/vitro assessments.
