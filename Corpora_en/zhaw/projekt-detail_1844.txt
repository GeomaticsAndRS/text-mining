Technology transfer from a variety of fields has strongly influenced the art of medical interventions in the past few years. Although a large part of this development found its way into the daily clinical routine, this is only the first milestone towards the integration of information technology into medicine. Widespread integrated use of information technology offers a huge and up to now only partially understood and explored potential for computer aided medical interventions. For this reason the center of competence CO-ME (Computer Aided and Image Guided Medical Interventions) has been established with the support of the SNFS (Swiss National Science Foundation). The goal of our project within CO-ME is to design an object oriented software platform for virtual reality based minimal invasive surgery simulators. These surgery simulators offer effective solutions for the development of training systems for surgeons. The development of such simulators requires a set of interdisciplinary skills from a variety of fields: the construction of anatomical models, real-time simulation of soft tissue deformation, instrumentation and force-feedback, real-time visualization as well as development of specialized soft- and hardware platforms. The software platform provides an open architecture to allow for easy integration of components from different research groups and also provides a system for fast prototyping, testing and verification of advanced simulation models and algorithms.
