ETH Zurich, Institute for environmental decisions, together with the cities develop the ZHAW Winterthur, Baden and Zug and the ETH Zurich can be strategies, as city dwellers, to motivate, to reduce their energy consumption. There is a special focus on energy-saving behaviour of clubs can be promoted. Content and the aim of the research project: With the individual demand is policies and programmes at the national level for energy services such as mobility, power and heat only heavily influenced. Therefore, cities are key actors to achieve private consumers. The research project examines ways of cities to encourage energy-saving behaviour. A focus on associations (E.g. sport club, District Association) as multipliers. In contrast to conventional channels such as about newspapers, websites or official journals, clubs allow an efficient and targeted communication of municipal campaigns and offers. These objectives are to be achieved with the project: • Overview and evaluation of urban actions for the promotion of energy-saving behaviour • research into the role of local associations in the implementation of these measures of core component of the examination are case studies and experiments in the three Swiss energy cities of Winterthur, Baden, and train. So, local knowledge can be used and developed concretely usable recommendations. Scientific and social context: by technical measures alone are the ambitious goals of the energy strategy 2050 hard to reach. The project investigates the role of associations in the promotion of energy-saving behaviour. It shows how cities can motivate their people to save energy and makes a contribution to the energy sufficiency research.
