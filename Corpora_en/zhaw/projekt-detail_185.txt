The aim of the project is the establishment of selected fungal strains in the rhizosphere of agriculturally important crops. This aspired biofilm builds protection against harmful insects on plant roots from fungal strains and other micro-organisms. First fundamental work was carried out in the SCIEX project (Rhizoshield, J. Kathryn) from last year, and in several semester bachelor and master projects. The latest literature shows a specific binding of selected strains of insect-pathogenic fungi and plant roots. We want to initialize a project to better understand the interactions between plants and the associated micro-organisms. A new strategy of biological control of soil borne pests is built with the acquired know-how. The vision is a better understanding of the complex interactions in the system of plant - microorganism - pests, to increase the protection of plants.
