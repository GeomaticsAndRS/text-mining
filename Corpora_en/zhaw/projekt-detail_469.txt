Sciex Fellowship: ArnicActiveCell: The development of a cell culture system in order to obtain biological active principles and indirect regeneration for Arnica montana species. The project addresses issues of innovative sustainable capitalization of Arnica montana, an endangered species with recognized traditional use in Europe due to the antiinflammatory properties of the extracts. The project consists of complex studies of Phytopharmacy and Biotechnology for the development of alternative methods for the generation of bioactive principles (mainly sesquiterpene lactones and polyphenolic compounds) and indirect regeneration of Arnica montana species.
