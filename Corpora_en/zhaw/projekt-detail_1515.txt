The steep roof as a phenomenon is captured in the pitched roof, a part of the innovation project pitched roof. The effectiveness of his appearance are described, classified, and typed. The (photographic) image serves as a medium and instrument of architecture science, in a way, as it has been developed in modern times. The corresponding potential of the image under today's, to reexamine conditions marked by a flood of images is part of the work. Also occasionally individual research are integrated into thematic essays, which have added value in the context above themselves. The manual aims to show the architectural potential of the sloped roof and make accessible the knowledge about the potential effectiveness of the steep roof a wide audience. The publication of the Handbook is planned in June 2008.
