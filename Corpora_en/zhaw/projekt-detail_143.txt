Missing adherence and compliance at home exercises is a barrier in physiotherapy. 2012, Microsoft has released an SDK with the KINECT sensor data are accessible. Through the use of the KINECT sensor installing motion sensors on the body of the patient for certain narrowly defined applications is superfluous. In this project we use the KINECT sensor to first pilot measurements for physiotherapeutic assessment and home exercises carried out. This can be the basis for a virtual physiotherapist. The program ensures the correct execution of the exercise frequency generated by a physical therapist or intensity by measuring the body movements of the patients and indicates patient error. The training program should provide all important key figures of the training course the physiotherapists.
