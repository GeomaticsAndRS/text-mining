Avalanche not only destroy SLF Davos, creating even small areas a wide variety of site conditions. Studies of the Swiss Federal Institute for snow and Avalanche Research SLF Davos have shown that the vegetation in avalanche trains with annual avalanche hatchways is varied as in those with rarer hatchways and about three times as high as in the adjacent Woods. As part of our project to examine the impact at the next level. As bio-indicators for the micro-climatic conditions on the surface of the ground the ground beetles collected, as indicators for the structural diversity of small habitats the locusts and as indicators for the variety and the herb and shrub layer forms the butterflies.
