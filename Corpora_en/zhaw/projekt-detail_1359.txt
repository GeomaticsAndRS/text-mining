Performance of the systems office building stands in direct relation to employees, organization, technology and built structures. At the heart of the project, the relevant parameters for the system performance in Office buildings are determined and summarized in an evaluation index of office buildings (homes, rooms, facilities and their management) for a people-oriented, productive use. Prospective typologies of flexible and diversitygerechten office buildings are identified and their behaviour in the Organization (E.g., process intelligence, leadership, and knowledge transfer) worked out. In this, the interactions between hard (such as cost, construction, energy) and soft factors (E.g. satisfaction, user need, atmosphere) are analysed comprehensively and systemically.
