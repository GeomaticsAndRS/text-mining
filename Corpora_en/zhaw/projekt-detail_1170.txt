In conventional biogas plants, a part of active bacterial biomass is washed out. This reduces the efficiency of the process and leads to long periods of residence with large fermenter enter volume. The membrane bioreactor (MBR), however, allows a separation of biomass and their repatriation in the reactor with the help of a downstream ultrafiltration (UF). Keep back the Methanogenic bacteria in fermentor, mineralized substances ("dead bacteria") are removed. This increases the efficiency of the procedure by an increased degradation of biomass. The liquid that has happened the UF permeate the membrane is hygienic. The separation with UF is an energetic efficiency (more gas per fermenter enter volume, solid fermentation process, smaller FERM enter volume) on the one hand and is also ideal for material use of the final product. This fertilizer products can replace commercial fertilizers and thus embodied energy. The heat efficiency poor in many cases can be increased within the framework of the material fermentation rest further treatment, such as the drying of solids or the ammonia stripping. In this project initiated by Meritec GmbH and the Engineering Office Hersener, the section of environmental biotechnology of the ZHAW is involved as a research partner and operates an experimental reactor at the laboratory scale. The project by BFE, BLW, Axpo and SER is financed.
