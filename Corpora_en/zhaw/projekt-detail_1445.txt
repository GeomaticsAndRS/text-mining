The company Energie Wasser Bern EWB has commissioned the IAM, the customer magazine?Direct? to evaluate. On the basis of planning documents and selected issues of the magazine, it has been tested, whether the magazine meets journalistic criteria and strategic communication expectations. The IAM has performed a qualitative analysis of the media and developed optimizations of the medial representation. EWB is a company with around 600 employees, providing products and services related to electricity, gas, water, district heating, waste recycling, and telecommunications in the Bern region. The project was realized under the direction of Dr. Peter Santos Herlach.
