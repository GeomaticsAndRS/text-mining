The IAM research team was tasked with a panel study for Raiffeisen. Expectations and interests of employees in relation to a new group-wide staff magazine, the third-largest Swiss banking group, are at the heart of the first telephone poll. This magazine should be launched in early summer 2007. The results of the survey will be incorporated into the final design of the magazine and to after one and after two years in a second and third survey terms of use and acceptance data are added. The project is led by Iris Giovanelli, researcher IAM research team.
