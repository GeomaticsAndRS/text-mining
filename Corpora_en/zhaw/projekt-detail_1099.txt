FRP composites are used increasingly and successfully in various buildings. The building material convinced little load-bearing components, as well as increasingly in statically relevant applications. Used correctly, the material in the architecture and engineering offers fascinating possibilities and many significant advantages over traditional solutions. Building with FRP should be brought closer to architects, engineers, builders and contractors and FRP producers. The Conference aims to provide the participating design, dimension, and run buildings at the end of the day-essential basics. Planning AIDS, main features of FRP and manufacturing processes with their characteristics will be presented. In particular new opportunities offered by the building material, but also the limits of FRP are pointed. Frequently asked questions about resistance, bearing capacity, design, sustainability, and more come to the language. The experienced and best ausgewiesenen speakers in detail present also executed buildings of the civil engineering and construction.
