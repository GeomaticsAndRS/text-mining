The goal of optimal stock management is to reach a sufficient delivery capacity at minimal cost. Conventional planning models neglect the stochastic elements of a storage system, such as fluctuations in demand or the procurement times. But let an analytical determination of optimal parameter for the warehouse management (reorder point and quantity). In collaboration with RAHN AG, a method was developed which can optimize the warehouse disposition of any product. The above stochastic aspects of the system are taken into account. The dynamics of the bearing, i.e. deliveries and orders are powered by the incoming orders. This dynamic is the ordering process itself by a simple statistical model, the parameter estimated from past orders described using discrete event simulation. The methodology allows for a desired readiness to determine an optimum, i.e. cost effective disposition strategy. With the new method the bearing a reference product could costs facing today around 35%.
