On behalf of the Swiss Federal Office of energy (SFOE), the Group of environmental biotechnology explores the possibilities of energy saving, which does not apply in conventional systems mainly for the ventilation of the aeration tank, in combination with an increased power generation from waste water. The aim of the study is on upcoming infrastructure upgrades to evaluate innovative and sustainable approaches, to integrate them in the future planning of the system, and thereby to achieve an optimized balance of energy and material. Special attention is placed on the anaerobic treatment, or the combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes and innovative filtration techniques in the field of urban waste water. These technologies can increase the energy efficiency of municipal wastewater agreement in connection with an optimized peripheral (E.g. fuel cell to generate electricity), to assign a neutral energy balance ideally.
