In this feasibility study, a procedure for determining the speed of vehicles has been tested. It is to generate a WÃ¤rmemarker on the rail surface by means of high-energy pulsed optical radiation and to detect it again by a subsequent IR sensor. The speed can be calculated from the runtime and the known distance between optical source and IR sensor. At the same time theoretical reflections, simulations on the computer, as well as experiments on mechanical testing equipments were carried out for the review. The results of this work packages match well. It was developed an evaluation method to enable more accurate detection of speed from the measured signals of the IR sensor even at very low signal noise ratio.
