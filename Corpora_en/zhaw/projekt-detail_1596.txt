In ongoing projects in the field of road transport, in particular the evaluation of traffic data and the development of forecasting methods for traffic conditions and travel times, as well as their integration into practical applications in the foreground are available. Equally important, but also the knowledge of the architecture of transportation management systems and system components is to optimally support our clients and partners with regard to functionality and interfaces of these systems. Aim of this project is to enable the relevant traffic management concepts, to identify data, as well as the components relevant within the system architecture, and to show how they interact. The knowledge of the relevant data and system components is used specifically to be able to specify the requirements for the measurement data (accuracy, availability, etc.). This has a decisive influence on the forecast methods developed by us and estimation methods.
