Aim of this project was to have a framework for processing and analyzing data of connection of computer networks using the latest algorithms from research fast and flexible can be implemented. The framework provides functionality often required as for example filters out of scanning traffic in the form of processing chains connectable modules. As a showcase two analysis ideas were implemented: (1) analysis of the development of onlinezeit of networked devices to investigate questions like: how many devices are constantly switched on? (2) automatic recognition of service endpoints. Thus, you can create a service map active abzuscannen for example without the network.
