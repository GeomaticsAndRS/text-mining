In the framework of maintenance planning for aircraft, the section has flight operations of the air force the problem to schedule various maintenance measures, so that on the one hand, the cost of maintenance is as small as possible and on the other hand the limited capacity of the workshop and the need for flight hours are taken into account. The creation, and especially also the continuously required updating of the maintenance plans are time consuming. For this reason it is aspired to automate the creation of the maintenance plan. A procedure is developed within the framework of this study, which is suitable for implementation on the computer. An automated procedure reduces the time required for the creation and updating of maintenance plans several times. The results of this preliminary study form the basis for the implementation of an operationally deployable automated procedure provided for in the second part of the project.
