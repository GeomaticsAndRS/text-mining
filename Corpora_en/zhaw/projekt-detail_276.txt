Landert Motoren AG the re Luk dance technology allows an increase in the energy efficiency of electrical drives, avoiding an increased resource requirement by oversizing, or the use of permanent magnets. In the present project, a synchronous reluctance machine capable machine (LSRM) expanded by supplementing with a short cage to a line-start. This engine can rotate synchronously without this angle measuring systems to be instructed on the network or on a collection converter.
