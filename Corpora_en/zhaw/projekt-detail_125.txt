New pretreatment measures should increase from currently less than 40% of the organic solids against 60% (oTS) the degradation degrees of the fixed material fraction of farm fertilizers in biogas plants. Anaerobic persistent substances should be biochemically identified and specifically signed up. The focus is on cow manure and the solids. The procedures to examine, such as hydrolysis, insect usage, milling, etc., require innovative, multi-level reactor systems developed size D and are to be tested by a laboratory scale up to P.
