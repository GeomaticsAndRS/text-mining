At the Institute, a prototype of information system was developed for Business Informatics the users to record their daily mobility patterns, which are valued according to criteria such as CO2 emissions in the port. The user can compare such reviews with each other thereby obtain suggestions for the improvement of their reviews. This system was the question to address, whether the mobility behaviour of users in playful manner can be affected. It turns out that with the detection of daily-used means of transport and traffic routes, the quantification of the evaluation criteria, the segmentation of the user reviews within user segments, as well as behavior alternatives suggest the technical requirements can be created compared for controlling user behavior.
