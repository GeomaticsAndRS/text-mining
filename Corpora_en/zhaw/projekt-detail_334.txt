The ZHAW developed an ecological forest key, with which the State and the appreciation potential of forests can be assessed reliably on behalf of FOEN. Practical tests have shown in the canton of Schwyz, which leads the application of this key to a much more critical assessment of forest edges than the State forest inventory (LFI) method used. In the framework of this project should be compared the two systems (LFI and Karim/ZHAW) and a common data set for a uniform overall assessment drawn up on this basis.
