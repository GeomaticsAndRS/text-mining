The spread of PDAs, Pocket PCs, and Smartphones as well as their performance will increase in the near future at the same time decreasing price. The units will be affordable in the future for each person, possibly hear with additional services such as music playback, voice recorder, radio, navigation, dictionaries, reference works, etc. Due to these properties it is close to use the devices, namely for learning, especially the repetition of learned, another area which also in short periods of time such as waiting on or driving in (public) transport and breaks of any kind is possible and useful. The fabric to repetierende should be collected with the help of a quick-to-learn, powerful, simple and open authoring system. In the future, each foreign language teaching materials should include a CD (or software to download) for mobile learning with the PDA. To successfully develop the PDA as a digital learning companion, it requires both linguistic as computer science competence, which is designated on the ZHW departments L and T. The project has developed a concept regarding the architecture of the digital learning companion and a corresponding author system and clarified the opportunities for. In the framework of a thesis developed a system to the repetition of words for a mobile phone. A prototype of the digital learning companion including the corresponding author system could be developed on the basis of this preliminary project, which is the basis for a successful commercial partner search for development and distribution of the device. The openness of the system allows the attractive option to place the facilitators as standard on the education market.
