The special climatic conditions in an altitude of 1000 metres and the cultivation on the sandy, stony soils existing at this altitude in the canton of Graubünden can be expected, that the composition (i.e. type / quality and ratio of ingredients / flavouring substances) there built so called mountain potatoes have differences with potatoes, which grow at normal altitude (max 500 m). Concrete can differences (variety-specific) are expected in the following areas: • in regard to the contained type and quantity of starch • with regard to the cooking behaviour (175, 175; Mealiness) • in the content of vitamin / mineral content • in type and quantity of the flavouring substances contained in the perceptible sensory characteristics (appearance, smell, taste, consistency) • if necessary a increased saturation effect for these potential differences of mountain potatoes (currently 21 varieties, including "Pro specie RARA") compared to normal farming potatoes reasons in the slowness of growth under the conditions described in the lower weight loss during the cooking, etc.
