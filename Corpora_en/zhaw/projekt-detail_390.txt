: 01.02.2013 in this pilot project be held tentatively several lectures as the flipped classroom. The classic elements of a lecture - lecture and homework - be exchanged in a "flipped"classroom: students prepare the content at home, and in the plenary, tasks are solved together with the lecturers and issues discussed. Because no more material must be given in plenary, there is plenty of time remains to to respond to individual questions of the students.
