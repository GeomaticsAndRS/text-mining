Agile Success Factors (2013-2014) The goal of this project is to find out and evaluate the critical factors for successful agile software projects. Based on the results of the Swiss Agile Study 2012, we will interview companies that have conducted successful agile projects and determine the factors that lead to successful projects. We also hope to find agile success patterns for different project types and company types. This is a common research project with the Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW) Funding: Hasler Foundation, Switzerland
