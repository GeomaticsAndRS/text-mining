This FUNalpin module aims at developing a concept for an indicator-based certification process for label regions, who are committed to sustainable regional development (NRE), within the framework of the elaboration of a strategy for a new regional policy. The suitability for this concept is validated against from selected areas. The examination of the feasibility of different certification systems (performance standards vs. process standards, self declaration vs. review, top-down vs. bottom-up, etc.) should be made taking into account implementation-related criteria.
