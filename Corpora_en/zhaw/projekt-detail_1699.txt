With the method of formative scenario analysis and the involvement of experts from science, industry and administration, three plausible, consistent scenarios were developed for economically weaker regions of the Swiss Alps for the year 2030. Two scenarios are diametrically apart. A scenario based on innovation and sustainability, and in addition to increasing domestic value added by an increasing volume of transfer payments is marked is on one side. On the other hand, a scenario was determined in which the today economically weaker Alps up to the year 2030 economically and socially fragmented and will be eroded. In addition to value added, the volume of transfer payments will have declined. A variant of this scenario, the 039;Musealization and solidification 039; with continuity of public service in peripheral regions, seems also plausible.
