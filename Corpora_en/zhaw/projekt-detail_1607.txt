In the face of this situation the authorities of the city of Winterthur, to trigger an efficient, effective and sustainable neighbourhood development process with the support of the participating universities in the Töss River goal.

The cooperation of the three universities (HSW, HSA Luzern and HSSAZ) stands for the redemption of this interdisciplinary claim.
