New substances of Novartis crop protection AG are examined on a test field near Schwaderloch (AG) according to agricultural aspects. To assess the risk of entry of these substances in the groundwater beneath the surface of the test, a series of computer simulations conducted with the model LEACHP. These bills cover a period of four years and are based on local soil and weather data. To represent the suspected range of properties of future development substances, the simulations with substances carried, which differ considerably in sorption and degradation properties: Atrazine and Pendimethalin triasulfuron. The calculated concentrations in groundwater are 1.45E-6 to 1.78E-2 µg/L (depending on the adopted sorption and degradation properties), for Pendimethalin always under 1E-9 µg/L and for triasulfuron at 9.61E-4 to 1.58E-1 µg/L for atrazine. Further has been estimated, that the discharged quantities of atrazine and Pendimethalin in all observed cases are below 0.01% of the applied amount for triasulfuron, however, significantly higher (up to 12.6%). However, this value is relativized by the small amount of effort by triasulfuron. In the context of the uncertainty to which model estimates are always connected, the risk of leaching on the trial field can be described as low.
