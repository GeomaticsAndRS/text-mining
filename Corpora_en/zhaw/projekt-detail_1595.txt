inNet AG due to the excessive pollution with nitrogen compounds, the canton of Lucerne has decided to investigate the impact of agriculture on the ammonia emissions (NH3). During one year the concentration of NH3 has been detected in the air using passive collectors at 25 locations in two chambers of terrain. At the same time, the management data in the adjacent plots as well as the characteristics of the farms in the area were detained. The aim was to separate the influence of the management of time and place varying background effects. Our approach: All measurement intervals, during which no Düngeaktivitäten were documented, were assumed to be influenced only by the background. Concentration values were logarithmised and analyzed as the sum of seasonal, regional and local effects by means of robust regression. The difference between log(NH3) and log(Hintergrund) was then analyzed as a function of the Düngemethode.
