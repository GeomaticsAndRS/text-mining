We want with modern digital techniques (latest versions of smartphones, digital automatic image recognition) to revolutionize pest management advice for our business and for our customers. A photo of the plant damage will be handed down by the user to a database. The geographical position, as well as the seasonal time and if possible, and the species is supplied directly by push of a button, bezw. queried by the application software. The accordingly expanded database will analyse the factors and the most likely disease bezw. Define pest, or also the abiotic damage by means of digital, automatic image recognition. This central database used various existing simulation models (E.g. SOPRA by Agroscope), combining the information with weather data from this location. The automatically used factors narrow the possibilities of a biotic, Japan. a abiotic damage and calculate this based on the eligible causes. If there are uncertainties due to the input and automatically generated data, the system will require additional photos with appropriate instructions and once again make a calculation and more accurate identification.
