The composition of traffic can be determined on the basis of the classification of individual vehicles at local sites. Prerequisite for this is that a high proportion of vehicles can be classified correctly. Will meet this requirement, the information, for example, to the Swiss road traffic counting can be used. The vehicle classification in accordance with SWISS 10, be distinguished according to 10 categories of vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.) is carried out in the Switzerland. The company ECTN AG has developed various software applications, from data from laser scanners (manufacturer: SICK AG) to create 3D profiles of individual vehicles. In this project is to develop an improved classification method, which vehicle parameters extracted from the 3D-Rohdaten to use. At the same time, also the choice of the parameters to be optimized.
