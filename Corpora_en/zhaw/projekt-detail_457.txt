Bechterew's disease sufferers have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that an intense cardio workout is effective and has no adverse effect on the course of the disease. However, classic Spondylitis movement groups in the country and abroad focus on exercises which do not receive the mobility of the spine, on the other hand on cardio workout. The present study aims to evaluate the current content of the Swiss movement groups with regard to heart circulation training units. On this basis a strategy for the national implementation of a heart-circulation training in the motion group of the Swiss Association to ankylosing spondylitis SVMB to developed and implemented. The study is based on the approach developed by Grol Walley (2005) to the implementation of innovations (implementation of change) and takes place in the following steps: A) analysis of current clinical practice; B) exploration and prioritization of barriers and promoting factors on cardio workout from the perspective of the stakeholders (Bechterew's disease sufferers, course instructors, rheumatologists/inside); (C) development of an implementation strategy tailored to the situation and pilot study; D) adaptation of strategies and nationwide implementation. The current practice, barriers and promoting factors is collected via survey, focus group discussions and interviews. The implementation strategy requires the definition of a sufficient heart-circulation training and taking into account the main barriers and promoting factors of stakeholders.
