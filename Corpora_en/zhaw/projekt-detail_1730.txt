Change, continuous changes and ongoing adjustments - for most employees now include these processes to work everyday. This however by no means indicates that it is hassle-free projects, employees react on the contrary often extremely sensitive to changes. But what makes a successful change project? How do employees react to change? What leads to acceptance, leading to refusal or resistance? How can the processes of change give a positive direction and control and what is harmful? These questions are at the heart of the research project. Five economic partners from the public sector, which have undergone recent major changes, perform quantitative and qualitative employee surveys. In a first step, these data for the respective business partners are evaluated and analysed to show where the staff in the change process and where there is potential for optimization. After conducting all interviews an instrument will be developed then in a second step, which allows to measure the quality of change processes specifically and consistently. In addition, there is the development of standards and guidelines for employee-related processes of change in focus. These guidelines should serve as an aid in the process of change eventually middle managers and employees.
