The new regulation of hospital financing was decided 2007 within the framework of the revision of the KVG. These dictates future performance-related packages for the in-patient health care, based on national uniform structures. Performance-related need to be developed for the cardiology and Pulmologische rehabilitation packages. The PCS to a) be a simple and practical system and minimise the documentation effort, b) be as free as possible of perverse incentives and manipulations as possible off - close, c) suitable for coding be revisions, and d) in the sense of a 'learning system' continuously can be adapted. A working group of the ZHAW and the clinics defined potentially cost explanatory patient characteristics and assessments until September 2013 for the survey. The ZHAW then developed a procedure to the random weekly selection of patients. In 300 cases, patient characteristics and cost data collected currently for a week. Then it is parsed, which patient characteristics suited best for the forecast of the costs. The result is a PC for performance-related tariffs in the clinics for cardiology and Pulmologische rehabilitation with a minimal number of assessments and simply to gathering information.
