Never animale cells grow even under optimum conditions with maximum productivity. They are always from the substrate (glucose) unwanted by-products, known as primary metabolites (E.g., lactate). How much primary metabolite formed, the cells are i.e. what metabolic State, is dependent on the concentration of substrate present. Objective of this thesis was to develop a feed method in which the glucose supply to the reactor is regulated so that the maximum productivity and the metabolite formation is minimal. This was achieved by using the calculation of online mass balances (Herwig et al., 2001) the metabolic State of the cells with the yield coefficient of oxygen to substrate, the YO2 / s has been evaluated. Decreases the YO2 / s, this is a sign for a reduced oxidative conversion of glucose and thus an increased lactate formation. This connection was successfully affiliated as a control signal for a step regulators of the inlet of substrate. The presented method could be used in connection with a complete automation of the process as an efficient tool for quantifying supply procedures for animal cell cultures.
