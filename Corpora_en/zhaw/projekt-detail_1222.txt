The quality of our drinking water is determined by a variety of physical and chemical parameters. These include among other things dissolved inorganic and oragnische substances, such as heavy metals or residues from fertilizers and pesticides. The monitoring of these parameters with online methods is still a major challenge. In close collaboration new methods with an industry partner are elaborated with electroanalytical measuring systems, which allow a qualitative or semi quantitative assessment of water quality.
