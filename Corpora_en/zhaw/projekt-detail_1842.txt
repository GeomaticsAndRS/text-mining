The future demands made on logistics, Office Fürrer Bürro-Fürrer builds a new storage and order-picking system due to e-commerce, to be grown. To support the fine and detailed planning and to ensure a timely commissioning of the equipment, the present plans is to be verified with a simulation study. To investigate the behavior of the system under various operating conditions and with different amounts of scaffolding in the model. The range mapping will be examined already in the planning phase dynamically in the Simulator, secured and optimized. A short start-up phase should be ensured by the simulation. The simulation can be used when changing volume structures and market requirements for determining performance boundaries under the most diverse conditions.
