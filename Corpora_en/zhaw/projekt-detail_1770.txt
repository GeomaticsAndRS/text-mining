In the framework of the project an operationally deployable tool is developed to optimize maintenance schedules for aircraft. The tool should be for all of the section to manage flight operations of the air force aircraft types can be used where each fleet for itself, i.e. without taking into account the other fleets will be optimized. First, the tool determines which flight operations out of the maintenance condition of the fleet at the beginning of the optimization period and of the applicable maintenance rules of section a first provisional maintenance plan (so-called master plan). The proposed master plan is the first input for the actual optimization. It can be changed by the user, i.e. proposed maintenance can be moved or fixed as the intensity with which aircraft are employed or decommissioning dates. On the basis of the modified master plan, the tool determines a next improved maintenance plan. So long, this iterative process is iterated until a satisfactory result is achieved. The tool has interfaces to the existing SAP system of section flight operations of the air force and on to a tool-specific database. The output of the system consists in a graphically formatted EXCEL table. This on the one hand represents the results of the optimization (of all aircraft maintenance time points), on the other hand, it is an interactive work area for input of constraints for the Wartungsportimierung.
