Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease. Results of the CTI project 7806.2 show that the Borrelia occur intracellularly. These findings imply that the occurrence of intracellular and cystic forms dominated in patients with chronic Lyme disease. CTI project to develop a diagnostic method, that specifically proves Antik√∂rkper against the Cystic forms of Borrelia and allows a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease. Material from patients with multiple sclerosis, Sarcoidosis, and heart valve tissue is checked for Borrelia and rickettsia helvetica. Human cells that continuously present intracellular Borrelia, serve as the basis for the determination of effective antibiotics in the cell culture model with respect to the treatment of chronic Lyme disease in the clinical environment.
