The aim of the project was a description of the dynamics of cotton fibers in a comb-machine. In this machine, which represents a stage in the process chain of the cotton blossom until the thread, mechanically combed cotton fibres and short fibres excreted. The dynamics of a cotton fiber network in such a machine is very complex and is determined by a variety of interactions between machine parts and fibres on the one hand and fibres with each other on the other hand. Because cotton is a natural substance, must also be expected with strong variability. A description of the process of the cotton group in the machine was developed in the project, which contains all process steps of a Comber and explicitly describes the influence of the elements on the cotton. The cotton group was modeled as formulate themselves its temporal dynamics in the form of a master equation is a stochastic Fibre composite. With this approach, the dynamic behavior of cotton in the machine could be described and simulated. In this way, gained valuable insights into the relationship between the constructive design of the machine and its performance.
