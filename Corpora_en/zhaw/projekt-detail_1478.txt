Wastewater treatment plants using aluminium and ferrous materials which have an influence on the further processing of sewage sludge in digestion and drainage. In particular bulking and floating sludge to be prevented or combated. In the framework of this project will be an integrated process optimization made and help the use of aluminium products compared to the competing products of iron. The project consists in the fine tuning of parameters of chemical, biological, and chemical engineering. If successful, the industry partner will extend its range of innovative products and gain additional value.
