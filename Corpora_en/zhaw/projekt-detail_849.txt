A detailed and objective examination of the gang image is an important part of a targeted therapy. The rehabilitation centre in Affoltern am Albis of the children's Hospital of the University children's Hospital Zurich takes advantage of our movement laboratory to examine gait in children and young adults with neuro-orthopedic diseases in a collaboration. Included are motion (kinematics), the forces acting on the body (kinetic), as well as muscle activity while walking or racing. Also, the effect of certain Orthotics on the gait pattern is tested. Thanks to the data obtained, our partners can better plan their treatment and evaluate therapeutic interventions. Through joint research activities, the quality of care is reviewed and improved.
