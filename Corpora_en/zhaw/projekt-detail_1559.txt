The project is the world's first in vivo production processes for a conjugated vaccine with an acid labile Antigen developed, whereby the conditions 1 study for a subsequent phase of clinical. To new biotechnological production process with recombinant E. coli and economic product formation rate, Glycosylierungsgrad, product purity and pyrogen content requirements the subsequent Proteinextraxtions and on cleaning procedures. The process technology is based on a novel, specially tuned combination of Plamidkonstruktion, media design, and process guidance. The effectiveness and protection of the not possible with conventional (chemical) technology product is demonstrated in animal studies.
