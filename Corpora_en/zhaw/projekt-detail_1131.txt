Since 1995, the SELVA for the main wood assortments current prices recorded by Graub√ºnden in the 5 whale regions of the Canton according to uniform criteria and forwarded to interested parties. The aim of the project was for each sales segment, which is determined by the species, the range and the region, to determine a current price of cubic meter.
