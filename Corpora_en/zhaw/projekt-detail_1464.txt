In collaboration with the PR Agency, Farner PR, the IAM explores the relationship between corporate communication and media from the point of view of journalists. Thus, the corporate communication should be judged by Swiss companies. The survey includes the communications services by economic operators, public administrations and other organizations. Interviewed are journalists from print, radio and TV, as well as selected freelance journalists from the German, the French and the Italian-speaking Switzerland. The examination is performed as an online survey.
