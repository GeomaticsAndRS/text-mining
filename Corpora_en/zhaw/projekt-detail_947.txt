The Thurgau agriculture (VTL) Association represents and promotes the interests of various agricultural departments, professional and economic sectors. In the course of the reorientation of its communication strategy, the VTL commissioned IAM Institute of applied media science with the analysis of the communication potential, of the media discourse and knowledge and the setting of the stakeholders. The results of these analyses have been evaluated in the context of strategy workshops and formed the basis for the definition of communication-strategic success factors. Project management: Dr. Peter Santos Herlach, head of consultancy IAM. Project assistance: Katharina Urbahn, Mirco Saner, Larissa Leuenberger.
