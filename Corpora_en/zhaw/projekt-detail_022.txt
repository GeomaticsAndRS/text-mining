Create an overview of the real and relevant for biodegradation of BAW conditions, which prevail in biogas and composting plants in the Switzerland (incl. pre-treatment, as well as storage) and comparison with the conditions of standardised mining standards. Valuation of quantities, product shapes and materials of BAW in relation to the suitability to the fermentation composting depending on the real and normalized mining conditions. Determination of residual content of BAW/plastics in several real samples of Digestate and compost systems with varying BAW/plastic content in the raw material.
