The project BetonMitKopf will give new impetus to the concrete element in order to creatively and technically high-standing industrial building. Using market analysis were developed applications and product range, proposed adjustments to the planning and production processes to today's requirements, as well as introduced new forms of communication, involving the expertise of concrete element construction at the professional public and education could be strengthened. The core of the project was the exploration of a so-called shell box. Systematically and comprehensively to make the technical and the architectural Centre, the real design and design work of the Planner was simulated. It continued to the aim of establishing indicative and stimulating work in the form of pilot studies and concepts for the applying Planner. As open concepts, these should be broadly applicable and future quality demands regarding functionality, ecology and architectural spatial interpretations and ways of expression. The following topics were focused in the research project: equipped structures, omnidirectional ceiling, structurally resolved exterior, pitched roof and suspended components.
