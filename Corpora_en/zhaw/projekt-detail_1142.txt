This project is embedded in a larger research project of the UFSP ethics uni ZÃ¼rich UZH (M.Christen). The aim of the project is to provide a design-to-use software tool that allows the measurement of coherence from interest groups and their underlying value systems, or general text spaces, in a sense, adequate. The project task comprises creating user software interfaces that enable easy interaction, as well as the graphical representation of data and results primarily. The actual software itself, as well as the conceptual framework was (and is), however, to a large extent in the overall project or before projects developed and is not primary subject of this subproject.
