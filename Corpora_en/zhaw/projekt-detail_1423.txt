Thus missing an essential basis, which could be consulted at matter planning and space development issues. The detection of outstanding landscape quality in their overall effect, which is a decisive factor for the recreational suitability of areas is missing especially for regional nature parks. In the context of the feasibility study for the regional nature park of Beverin (GR) tourism and sustainable development in cooperation with the Department a method was developed, which works with the approach of the subjective evaluation of different qualities of landscape diversity, closeness to nature and privacy based on clearly defined criteria.
