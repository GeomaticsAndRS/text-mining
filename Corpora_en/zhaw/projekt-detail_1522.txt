Technical and engineering activities have social impact in addition to ecological and economical. Since the Brundtland report and the Rio Conference in 1992 defined the social as a third dimension of sustainability in addition to the ecological and the economic dimension, the discussion on social performance and the assessment of social aspects is rekindled (also in the Department of T on the ZHW). The Centre sustainability in the priority programme environment has developed the social compatibility analysis (SCA) in 1999. With this tool, social impact can be collected and evaluated. The SCA is been tested while designing a new KVA and come to use in the assessment of different sewage sludge disposal. The good experiences want to sit a the Centre sustainability in collaboration with the InIT for the further development of the SCA to an (GIS based) IT instrument to measure social impact.
