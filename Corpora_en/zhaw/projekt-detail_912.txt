Psychiatric services is different well documented: while a census exists (medical statistics), in the stationary area needed in the outpatient area a combination of different data sources. The estimation of supply needs which extend beyond the real psychiatric services, is a lot harder, especially if estimates at the small-scale level should be generated. As for such a valuation survey data must be used, which include regional a few cases due to their random nature, no direct and sufficiently precise statements about the need for supply are possible at regional level. The study will address this deficit by means of innovative statistical estimation methods. On the basis of so-called 'small area'-models, which combine data from different sources, the precision of the estimates of the mental health care needs to significantly increase at regional level.
