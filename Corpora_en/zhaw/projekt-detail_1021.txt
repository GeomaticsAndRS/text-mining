AGILE (Confederation of the disabled patient organisations) the special needs of people with disabilities, who want to study or study at a University, are hardly considered the physical infrastructural level or at the level of the design of the study situation. In the project inventory of barrier-free college is examined, how accessible Swiss higher education institutions for people with disabilities are and what difficulties in the implementation of measures to improve the accessibility. The inventory is based on a telephone survey of selected experts at universities in Switzerland. The project is closely linked with the study of barrier free college which is also performed by the ZHAW.
