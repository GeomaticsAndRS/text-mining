The Centre for cultural management (ZKM) the ZHAW, the theater Winterthur and the TQU AG Winterthur develop a sustainable Theatre typical quality management system (theatre quality frame) on the basis of a pilot project at the theater Winterthur. It contains the typical Theater core process 'End of season' as well as supporting processes, management processes and energy management. Indicators for process performance at theatres are re-created. The theatre quality frame is DIN 50001-compatible and theatre-specific EN ISO 90001 and ISO. The project is supported by the Commission for technology and innovation (CTI) of the Federal Government. Project duration: October 2012 and December 2013.
