In this project a portable prototype of patient support system developed so far for the shoulder joint (Figure 1). The system with two degrees of freedom (abduction and Flex / extension) to assist in common activities of daily life like such as food, hair comb, or laundry hanging on the shoulder joint. The patient support system was implemented as a exoskeleton with three serial hinge joints. The first joint recreates the elevation movement of the scapula, so that the axes of the second and third joint on the Glenohumeralgelenk are aligned. Each joint is powered by an electric motor, the transmission is carried out by means of Bowden cables. The prototype is worn with a carapace on the body and held in place by a rail on the upper arm. The system can support up to 120° abduction, flexion of 120 ° and 50 ° extension movements. Function tests have shown up on a doll, that the range of motion required for common activities of daily living can be achieved. The development of patient-supporting system is continued in a follow-up project for at least a year. While the manual control of the prototype must be replaced first by a regulation. It is intended to align the exoskeleton by EMG signals of the shoulder muscles. In addition alternative concepts are worked out parallel to the existing prototypes such as Bachelor of patient-supporting systems. The project is in planning.
