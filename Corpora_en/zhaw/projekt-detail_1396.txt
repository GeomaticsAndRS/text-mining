The aim of the project is the development of a new and innovative matrix as a substitute of autologous connective tissue transplant for dental use. The demand for such a bio-materials is given in various issues of the dental practice, where a massive volume loss of gum tissue leads to physiological and aesthetic challenges. As common therapy, a piece of the patient's own connective tissue is transplanted to the defect area currently. The connective tissue replacement to replace this body's tissue. This absorbable organic material of compression through the surrounding tissue's ability to resist and thus represent an ideal matrix for the regeneration of the missing tissue, in in vitro and in vivo studies are reported. For the in vitro studies, the matrix with primary cultures of human gingival fibroblasts is settled and held under conditions that mimic the mechanical stresses of a closed soft tissue wound. Analysis on the Volumenerhaltes of the organic material, as well as the expression of the phenotype of cells in various stages of differentiation should give the necessary findings on the quality of the material for use in a soft tissue wound. In vivo studies in animal models in clinical conditions allow statements about the biocompatibility and the behavior of the material (acceptance, integration, volume) in the tissue, especially in comparison to the autologous graft
