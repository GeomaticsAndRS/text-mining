Research universities generate knowledge and competences. Application-oriented research assumes that relevant new knowledge in cooperation projects comes with practice partners and in the areas of performance studies and training will be transferred. The project investigated how knowledge communication must be made E projects in F, so use and competence development are sustainable. 20 project managers of representative F of E-projects by universities of applied sciences were interviewed to find out - what the specific conditions and success criteria of F are E projects, - how and where, in the course of these projects, knowledge is generated – such as the communication of this knowledge in the project and organized outside is — such as the knowledge transfer will be. Six critical success factors are described in detail in the final report could be determined (cover from the project leader haru@zhaw.ch). The findings of the project managers provide valuable insights into the F E project everyday life at universities of applied sciences project teams, project management, rectors, funding bodies. The project was financed by Softnet (CTI) and conducted by the Institute for applied media science IAM of the ZHW in collaboration with the University of applied sciences Solothurn in North-West Switzerland FHSO. The project was completed in December 2003.
