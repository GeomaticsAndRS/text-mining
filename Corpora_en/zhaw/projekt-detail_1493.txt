The here of proposed project aims to develop a knowledge base data, which also contains information about the appropriate Visulasierung of the abnormalities in addition to the classification of the quality by an expert for an expert system to intelligent quality management and the differential expression analysis of DNA Microarray. The described expert system to help experimentalists intelligently evaluate large Mikroarraydatens√§tze in an efficient way, by important quality characteristics of high-dimensional data sets are visualized and proposals for quality evaluation and for appropriate further analysis steps are generated.
