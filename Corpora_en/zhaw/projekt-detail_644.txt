A finished prototype of the Lyra ™ gear trainer of ability (formerly habtronics) is available. Official inauguration of December 2013. In addition to usability studies, first evidence of efficacy of "simple" feedback with clinical partners are planned. A systematic literature search and assessment was carried out to obtain the conformity of the Lyra ™ of course trainer. Their assessment by a 'notified body' (compliance point) is still out.
