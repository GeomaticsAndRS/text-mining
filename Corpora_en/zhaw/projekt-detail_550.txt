Stadtwerke Winterthur, Solarspar flat roofs are for economic and ecological reasons increasingly planted and used for energy use. Because flat roofs is increasingly used to generate electricity, a combination of both systems is obvious and as economically makes sense ecologically. But so far only partially scientifically collected the benefits of the combined use of the flat roof. The project closes this gap and explored the role of the various elements of the overall system green roof/PV and test different combinations. There are energy-related and environmental issues in the Center.
