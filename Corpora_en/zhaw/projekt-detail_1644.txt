It is worth. Both campaigns are built primarily on posters in tram and bus, as well as on posters in the city of Zurich, supplemented by various other advertising media. A project team at the IAM was commissioned an evaluation of the campaign end of September 2005. Twenty people aged from 22 to 90 years discussed in five rounds of talks. A uses-and-gratifications approach was away conducting it: messages should be perceived, then they must allow cognitive, affective, social, integrative and habituell interactive use. The talks showed that the posting of posters reached many people. The messages of the campaign caused it a moment of meditation in everyday speaking campaign on. Individual subjects challenged to the opposition. The campaign was discussed with friends and acquaintances. In part, the prompt was implemented talk to an old person, surprising, yes funny way in everyday life. However, it was well recognized that the exercise just so to speak, with older people no longer is relationships and small families the General Metropolitan repertoire of individuals.
