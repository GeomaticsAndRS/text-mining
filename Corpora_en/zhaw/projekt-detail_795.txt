Forme footwear ® is a new ergonomic shoe design. Eight healthy subjects became a week on the new shoes. After they were on the way in forme footwear ®, traditional shoes and barefoot tested. Kinematics, Kinetics and spatio temporal response variables were measured ® power plates ® infrared cameras and 2 AMTI with 7 Vicon; the muscle activity by Oberflächenelektromyographie (muon ®). The test subjects went faster, with greater stride length and smaller Cadence while walking in forme footwear ® compared to traditional shoes and Barfussgehen. The analysis showed changes the kinematics and kinetics of the upper ankle joint in the sagittal plane. At the initial contact with the ground, plantar flexion is reduced and the middle class during the dorsal extension. The torques at the ankle joint is changed accordingly. There showed a slightly elevated knee flexion in the knee joint during the entire stance phase. There was a slight increase of the external adduction moment during the entire stance phase in the frontal plane. No differences apparent in the hip joint. The results indicate there is a faster and more ergonomic approach without additional joint loading on the ankle. The changes of in walking speed and stride length indicate a more ergonomic gait. The higher torques in the knee joint should be investigated further, because footwear ® form in patients with knee pathology may be contra-indicated. These results should be verified but with larger clinical trials groups. The project was successfully completed.
