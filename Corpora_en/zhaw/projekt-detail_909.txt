There is currently no uniform collection of flat-rate hours for lecturers (ILP/IAA) at ZHAW. In some departments, it is heavily electronic supports and in others the registration is done manually. The regulation, which staff category must capture an ILP/ILV in what level of detail, is regulated differently in all departments. A new database solution (IAA collector) will allow a single entry for all departments. The Institute for applied simulation has developed a database solution for the Dept.N proven the last two years. This existing solution is used as a default for the IAA collector to be programmed. The present document describes the planned approach.
