This is part of a EU cooperation. Our contribution is planned as follows Generalized hyperbolic (GH) distributions will be unsed in a univariate and multivariate context to fit financial and non-financial time series. This class of distributions is very flexible and allows one to statistically describe extreme events. To apply this method to short series, a robust fitting technique will be developed. Different type of time series will be fitted: (i) High-frequence univariate returns of the so-called GOP (growth optimal portfolio) which has been constructed in a previous work. (ii) Daily multivariate returns to the GOP expressed in differenet numeraires. (iii) Performance measure Sharpe-Omega for monthly hedge fund returns. Since these time series are pretty short, this requires the robust techniques (iv) Returns distributions generated by multiagent models for financial markets. (v) Suitable events generated by multiagent models outside financial markets. This will give some means to characterize distributions of extreme events. The work is important in view of risk quantification, measurement and mangement of extreme events. Cooperation in particular with J.P. Bouchaud (all financial-market related aspects), E. Capobianco (statistical aspects), S. Solomon (statistical properties of multiagent models) and Prof. Coakley (option pricing). Additional cooperations with COST-P10 members is warmly welcome.
