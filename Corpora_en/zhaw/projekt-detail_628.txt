The project PHYTFIRE is aimed at the development, adaptation and application of innovative phytosanitary tools to fill fundamental research gaps in pathogen detection and epidemiology that will improve fire blight phytosanitary and control strategies. Data will be collected to advise Plant Protection Officer (PPO) in updating phytosanitary policies, exchange/training of scientists will build capacity within an Europe-wide PPO support structure, and active technology transfer/dissemination at national levels will improve stakeholder participation and approval of fire blight phytosanitary efforts.
