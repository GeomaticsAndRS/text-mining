This project is a collaborative project of the Center for technology communication with the Centre for marketing management (Brian P. RÃ¼eger; Frank Hannich. Cornelia Sauer). The aim of the project is to investigate the ease of a newly launched E-mailing campaign using the methods of usability testing and eyetracking, and to develop optimization recommendations for future campaigns.
