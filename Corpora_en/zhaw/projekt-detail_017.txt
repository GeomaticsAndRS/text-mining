Agile Windpower AG in the study is a novel wind turbine (vertical axis technology) with regard to their environmental effects (shadow, noise, impact flora fauna, landscape effects) examined. The results can be used to assessing a construction input for a pilot plant. During the subsequent operation of the pilot, the impact can be validated (follow-up).
