Research project to investigate the impact of postures and muscle fatigue on cognitive performance by helicopter pilots. The posture of helicopter pilots at lower load flights with a bubble (a bulge in the side Windows, which allows a vertical view of the underload) is not ergonomically designed and the strain on the posture and locomotor system of the pilot, as the predecessor project pointed investigation of physical exertion of helicopter pilots (SFLV 2012-065). The following action to investigate, what impact has this extreme posture on the cognitive performance of pilots and to flight safety. The project is in planning.
