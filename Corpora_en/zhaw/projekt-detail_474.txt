The current yield of a large, complex PV system with different orientation of the modules can with the today available below standard calculation programs are not calculated and certainly not optimized EKZ. Therefore, the goal is the creation of a software for the calculation and optimization of large PV systems with complex geometry. On the basis of the test facility for the project at Lake Walen the calculation results will be validated and optimized (this test facility will be the Office renewable energy along with the EKZ designed and built by).
