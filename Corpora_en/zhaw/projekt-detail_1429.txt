Bringing together the four universities ZHW Zürcher Hochschule Winterthur, HSW Hochschule Wädenswil, HSSAZ School of social work in Zurich and HAP College of applied psychology to the ZHAW Zurich University of applied sciences in the summer of 2007 made it necessary to design a new website. The challenge was to combine a uniform Web presentation of new College with a separate appearance of the 8 departments (faculties) with very different audiences. The new website www.zhaw.ch went to the 1.9.07 online.
