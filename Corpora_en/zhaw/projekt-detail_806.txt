The mobile app smartpoll allows it students, to complete tests in preparation for exams on the way and independently by a mobile data connection. So far, the students of the ZHAW prepare paper on their exams in the subject economics with mathematical and textual test questions. Some tasks show the expected approach with sample solutions, discusses the student solutions in the presence of other tasks. In this way, the incentive to the independent processing of tasks is maintained. Disadvantage, however, is that the students can get no feedback on the quality of the own solution trial outside of classroom time. Now, the CENL has developed a mobile app for smartphones with Android and iOS operating systems. The Smartpoll app makes it possible to answer questions about specific topic areas from the compartment and to get feedback on the correctness of the solutions immediately. A wireless Internet connection is not always necessary, because our app stores the knowledge tests for offline use if one has called once before with a wireless connection. Students can prepare this way time, place - independent lecturer and at its own pace and in the desired frequency and intensity on the tests.
