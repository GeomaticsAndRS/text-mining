EPFL, Prof. Gabor Laurenczy In this project, non-hazardous formic acid is considered as a viable chemical storage system for hydrogen. The development of a medium-scale reactor is described which will be used to effect the catalytic production of hydrogen from formic acid for use in a downstream fuel cell. In order to realise an efficiently functioning reactor and fuel cell couple, three independent but interrelated research areas are involved. The first concerns the design, prototyping and testing of a suitable reactor, which will be carried out at EPFL. Initial benchmarking studies will gauge process efficiency which will provide useful feedback for future design optimisation. A second, concurrent task involves computer modelling, which will be undertaken at ZHAW. In this work, the precise flow dynamics, heat transfer mechanisms and effects of particle size and pore microstructure will be simulated. The engineering and modelling groups will interact closely in order to develop effective strategies for mutual improvement. The third arm of the project, based at PSI, will study the compatibility of the reactor gas outflow with single- and multi-stack PEM (proton exchange membrane) fuel cells. Parameters such as gas flow rate, fuel cell morphology, inlet gas composition and the influence of low-level impurities will be studied over a range of temperatures. Assessment of these results will culminate into a set of acceptable operating conditions to be followed in commercial designs for optimal power transfer and fuel cell longevity.
