While there is much activity in making individual Data Centres more energy efficient, there is still significant opportunity for innovation in the energy efficiency particularly in the context of networked data centres, increased use of renewables and smart energy grid. Combining greater dynamics in energy supply with the ability to move load around a network of Data Centres can lead to greater energy efficiency in the overall network. The project aims to reduce Power Usage Efficiency (PUE) to 1.2 and expects a 30% improvement in other Data Centre energy efficiency metrics (CUE, ERE).
