In the media, this topic is often under the slogans of "Educational emergency" or "Educational catastrophe" dealt with, in the professional discourse mainly two reasons relationships emerge: these are on the one hand, an education-theoretical and political perspective and on the other hand a theoretical society and family psychological. The first known perspective founded the need of parent education especially with the PISA study and resulting PISA shock, the second called with the increasing diversity and complexity of the social framework.

The pilot project will be evaluated scientifically on behalf of the Office for youth and vocational guidance (AJB) of the canton of Zurich. The accompanying evaluation examines in particular, how the parental education should be designed so that they are considered as relevant from the point of view of the main players and represent added value for all involved. In addition, an empirical basis for the decision aims to evaluate, whether the project will be introduced. The evaluation covers the entire period of the pilot project and is divided into six modules. These involve different perspectives (parents, school leaders, teachers and course guide at the end), as well as a variety of research methods.
