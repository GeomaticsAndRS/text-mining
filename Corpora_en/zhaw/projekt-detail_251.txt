VPH Share, Klinik Hirslanden, Swiss Neuro Foundation The vision is to become the world-wide reference of morphological analysis of pathologies and provide access to a comprehensive collection of clinical cases. First, we will concentrate on intracranial aneurysms, as we have access to a collection of cases from the EU-project @neurIST. Each case will contain the virtual replica of the IA, the automatically detected shape features (e.g. Zernike invariants), the location/environment of the IA, and personal information about the patient. With the increasing number of cases the database will serve as a valuable pool to classify the pathologies and to detect risk patterns. Also, the physician can compare cases with similar character to plan the treatment. This will reduce the risk to the patient and significantly cut health care costs. The project is partially funded by the EU project VPH share as a use case. Partners are the Klinik Hirslanden and Swiss Neuro Foundation.
