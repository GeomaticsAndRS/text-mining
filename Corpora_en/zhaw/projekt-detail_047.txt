Power to gas allows using excess renewable electricity to produce Hydrogen and to transform it to renewable methane. Methane can be used to drive natural gas vehicles. The processes described use building blocks made of existing technologies, link the grids for electricity and natural gas and make large existing storage capacities accessible for renewable electricity. The system has the potential to make a huge contribution to the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050. The project tackles questions on sub-systems, business cases and politicial boundaries with an interdisciplinary team from an application and implementation point of view.
