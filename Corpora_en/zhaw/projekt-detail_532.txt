For the growth market which is (mini) bio-reactors, a combined pH / oxygen sensor (CombiSense) developed. The optical measurement of oxygen and the potentiometric pH measurements are incorporating in a glass sensor. The sensor head contains the measurement electronics and is coupled with an opto electronic interface to the glass sensor. Located at the end of the project, tested in biotechnological applications, from prototype and series suitable for manufacturing processes are developed.
