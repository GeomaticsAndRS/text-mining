A Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) connects a bypass vessel to the Coronary Artery (CA). The first CABG on a beating heart was done in 1994 by immobilizing part of the heart surface with the benefit of faster patient recovery. In comparison to manual surgery, an automated connection of two arteries can improve the precision of an operation, reduce the time it takes, and therefore be beneficial for patient recovery. In phase 1 of Co-Me, a semi-automated suturing process for distal anastomosis, involving a new device called Â«Cobra-ToolÂ» with a helical needle and a drive unit, has been developed in collaboration with the ETH Zurich and the University Hospital Zurich. The system produces semi-automatically continuous suture anastomosis using polypropylene threads. Using this novel device, conventional mammary artery grafts to coronary artery end-to-side anastomosis on explanted pig and sheep hearts have successfully been performed. The objectives of phase 2 include the improvement of the tool specification through the solution of technical problems and the completion of in vivo animal tests.
