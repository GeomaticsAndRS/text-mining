In the canton of Zurich, lacked a systematic and comprehensive overview of the children's and youth development. This led to duplication, lack of coordination and ultimately to the ramming of resources. The governing body? okaj Zurich? has set itself the aim to remedy these shortcomings and launched a project to increase the effect of child and youth development in the canton of Zurich. The HSSAZ is significantly involved in the construction of an Observatory, which will make available up-to-date statistical and substantive data on the municipal and cantonal child and youth development. Since April 2006, the online - database www.okaj.ch/ information Office is accessible. Previously conducted a broad survey of organisations active in the youth work. The report?Survey on youth work: taking stock in the canton of Zurich? presents selected results from the survey in 2005.
