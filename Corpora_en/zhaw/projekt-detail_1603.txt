Health magazine provide not only legally prescribed information content, but also a variety of topics related to health promotion and disease. However, it is still unknown whether the magazines are actually read, and whether the information will reach the insured. To use, to investigate the acceptance and the evaluation of their health insurance magazine, three health insurance companies gave 2005 a telephone survey of readership in order. The evaluation will also provide findings about the structure of readership (gender, age, education), as well as to the influence of the magazine on the image of the three insurers. The investigation as a benchmarking study is to compare the results of the three magazines.
