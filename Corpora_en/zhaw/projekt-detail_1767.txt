The ZHAW (School of management and law) has examined together with the University of Fribourg (Dept. of social work and social policy) of national research programme 51 ("integration and exclusion") on the basis of six selected atypical employment forms (work on demand in the retail trade, temporary work, home work, international employment, new self-employment and moonlighting by sans papiers), whether and to what extent atypical workers enjoy social protection and the role of the labour and social security law with regard to social integration and social exclusion. The project was completed in 2008
