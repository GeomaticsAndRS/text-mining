The SRG media study offers invaluable material to the Swiss media usage and media behavior of the Swiss population, which can be analyzed and used but currently not in the current form. The present project is to ensure the material of the years 1996 to 2000 and make accessible new scientific use. The data thus prepared are not only interesting regarding the use of the media and as a basis for media policy assessments and decisions, but generally allow an insight into the everyday behaviour of the Swiss population dominated by media and thus also contribute to the Swiss social and media history. The project plans to the securing, development and archiving the data in six steps. Because the media situation has changed discontinuously in the period of the study of media and this is taken from her, the various stages of the media study should be reconstructed in a first step and documented. After this processing, a usable for data analysis data file over the five-year period is made. As an option, you can create an update of the data and an appropriate longitudinal comparison for the year 2008. With the synchronized data file media behavior, preferences, motifs and patterns are in the context of the entire media use throughout the day represented, tested and modeled. The development and a selected set of data be made available to the public in the form of SIDOS evaluation profiles with detailed description of the data.
