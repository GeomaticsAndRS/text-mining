The canton of Glarus has made measures to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency to the target. The importance of the resource of biogas as a contribution to the energy supply in the canton of GL is recognized. Already today, the sewage treatment plant of Glarus in BILTEN produces significant amounts of renewable energy from biogas in the form of heat and electricity. Equipment for the fermentation of green goods and agricultural and commercial organic waste are not yet in operation in the canton of GL, however. The canton of GL offers the potential for a large number of bio-gas plants due to its settlement and country economic structure and its Gr√∂ssenicht. It is therefore at an early stage to decide what type of investment, which sites and which substrates for biogas production are suitable. For this decision, data gaps as regards quantity, origin and technology capability of the existing and potential organic wastes are currently from households, agriculture and the industry. A study of the environmental biotechnology group will this gap through a comprehensive material flow analysis for organic waste (excluding lignified goods), which are suitable for the biogas production, close.
