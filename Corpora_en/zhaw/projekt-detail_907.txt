Background: In the rehabilitation clinic Singh icon of pain behavior sheet was developed, which includes key aspects of dealing with pain, performance and consistency. The pain behavior bow is an evaluation sheet for lumbar nonspecific low back pain, in which the therapist holding observations, which he sees in the patients during the "evaluation of the functional performance of". Until now neither the content -, design - examined the predictive validity of this supplementary information sheet. The aim of the study: methods check the self-interest and internal consistency, as well as the concurrent validity: cross-sectional design data from the multicenter study "Assessing the performance during the evaluation of functional performance in patients with non-specific non-acute low back pain" (Institute for physical medicine USZ, Bellikon and Valens) already for the most part collected (n = 146, stand 6.12.10) and collected until the end of 2011. It is aspired a sample size of 200-250 participants. A group size of 150 (range of the number patients by 108-243) and 100 (64-144) was described as a sufficient, to get a 99% and 95% confidence interval for the item calibration (/-0.5 logits) to reach (Linacre J; Rasch MEAs Trans1994). Statistical analysis: the study questions using statistical methods can be answered from the data set. It is calculated with fast analysis that examined construct validity and separation for the determination of the internal consistency of the person index is. The concurrent validity is überüft with correlations with other questionnaires from the multicenter study and regressions are used for the tertiary question.
