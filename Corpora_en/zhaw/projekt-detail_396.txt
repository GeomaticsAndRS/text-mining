www.gesundheit.ZHAW.ch/ foot care a serious complication of the disease diabetes mellitus (DM) is the diabetic foot syndrome with poorly healing chronic wounds. About every fourth person with DM suffers a diabetic foot ulceration at least once in his life. Even after healing of these ulcers they occur again in 34% of cases after one year, in 61% of cases after three years, and in 70% of cases within five years. Therefore, guidelines describe the importance of regular inspection of feet and foot care by the persons concerned. Patient training, as this foot inspection can be carried out, is therefore an important intervention to reduce diabetic foot ulcers. The manner of these training programs must be effectively designed, are few and conflicting research results. The objective of the study is therefore the review of the effectiveness of training developed in the Switzerland and counselling programme, which is carried out by care professionals in the hospital-external area. The study included patients with high risk which already suffered from a foot ulceration and provided in an outpatient wound clinic. The randomized controlled trial, which will be held in the Zurich metropolitan area offers additional training, individual skill training and advice for people in the intervention group. Care experts APN (advanced practice nurses) perform the interventions for those affected at home and join an advisory capacity during a year. As a result, a lower Rehospitalisationsrate, as well as less emerging diabetic foot ulcers are expected.
