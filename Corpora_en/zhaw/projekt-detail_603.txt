Many different professional groups are involved in the treatment and care of patients with orthopedic surgical procedures in a modern hospital. A good co-ordinating planning is necessary. Internationally this recommended so-called "patient paths" which hold the entire treatment and care process of patients. Such patient paths the Balgrist University Hospital nursing has developed in cooperation with the Institute for care of the Zurich University of applied sciences (ZHAW), implemented by care professionals. The introduction is planned on the two biggest stations of the Balgrist University Hospital and is accompanied by a care-scientific study of the ZHAW for the next two years. Goal is to test whether care derived patient paths have an effect on the quality of care and patient satisfaction. Also changes in the work situation of nursing professionals and business impact are examined. On our homepage for information on the current status of the project.
