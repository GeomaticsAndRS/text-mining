The Rhaetian Railways (RhB) would like to its employees from the Division infrastructure with the fields of activity in terms of environmentally friendly design, the development of licence applications, but also in the realization of, for example, including an environmental management off tunnelling, engineering structures, station tags and railway service and educate. The main focus should be set on projects and buildings for which no EIA must be drawn up. With these training events, a basic understanding of employees for environmental issues and requirements should be rebuilt, such projects are largely independent planning to document and conduct.
