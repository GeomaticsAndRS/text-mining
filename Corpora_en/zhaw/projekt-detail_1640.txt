In Zambia in 2006 general elections took place. Many international ministries have offered new training courses for journalists in the run-up to the elections, especially in the specialty of election coverage. The work field of media in international cooperation carries out an investigation in collaboration with the course provider Deutsche Welle, to determine whether and how the students later were able to implement the learned in the training in the practice. To journalists about their working and settings will be interviewed as also radio contributions by participants before the course and after the course of real coverage of the election campaign compared. The news broadcasts of the major radio stations in Zambia serve as another basis for comparison. The media quality tool developed at the MIC for the analysis of substantive coverage is applied here for the first time the evaluation of courses.
