: 01.03.2011 in this project involves building an institutional partnership with three universities in Eastern European countries with the aim to develop structures to control and investigate literal development in social and humanities courses. Writing is little present in many Eastern European countries as a means of learning. Competence-oriented education in which is independent or research-oriented learning in the foreground, is only rudimentary in the making, although the differences between individual countries and universities are substantial. Writing should be made clear as a means of independent learning and anchored in the curricula. This project aims at creating institutional partnerships with three universities in Eastern European countries to develop organizational structures for the study and fostering of academic literay in the humanities. Teaching based on research-oriented and independent learning in the post communist countries is still not very common. Writing as a means of self-directed learning will be studied and integrated into the curricula of selected study programs.
