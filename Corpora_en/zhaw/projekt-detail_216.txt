eaternity The carbon footprint of foodstuffs is a key factor for sustainable development of the food sector. One of the major factors contributing to the carbon footprint of foodstuffs is the heating of greenhouses. The required quantity of heating is highly variable depending on production season and local climatic conditions. The objective of this project is to develop a global model that allows for a country-specific quantification of the carbon footprint of agricultural crops grown in greenhouses.
