In the teaching and test IUNR is an MS-Access - plants database, used for various purposes such as: Pflanzenlernparcour manage, create stock lists, define prices, labeling of plants for experimental and teaching. The tool is old, is based on a roughly 18-year-old works database, and no longer meets the current demands in large parts. Therefore, creating a successor solution is planned within the framework of this project that can cover extended requirements from the teaching.
