The herb and blight (Phytophtora infestans) caused immense worldwide crop losses. The best known example of the devastating effects is the famine in Ireland between 1845 and 1849, which has taken the lives of nearly one million people and forced another two million to emigrate. The pathogen has not lost since then to its virulence, only diversification in the cultivation of staple foods, high proper planting material and the use of PPPs have softened the impact. Despite this progress this is (PSM) manufacturers pathogen, or the search for new fungicides for many pesticides at the top research objectives. Phytomedicine research group has a large collection (80 strains) of bacterial strains obtained from insect pathogenic nematodes in the Switzerland. An initial screening of a few of these tribes, in the framework of a master's thesis, has now shown that many have a very strong fungicidal effect against Phytophtora infestans. This is even more surprising that p is difficult to combat infestans chemical as well as biological means. Project objectives: in the framework of a project (NF or FOEN) the entire collection together with the benthic bacteria belonging to the genus should now Pseudomonas which ETH Zurich on their fungicidal activity against p. infestans and other fungal diseases, as well as on selected pests to be checked. In a second step the responsible toxin should be identified and isolated, it may be to develop a plant protection product.
