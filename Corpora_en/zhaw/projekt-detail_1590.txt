KENDOX AG in this KTI project components were developed in cooperation with KENDOX AG for enhanced security features of a document management system (DMS). The first component guarantees compliance with access rights to documents outside of the DMS. This was achieved through the integration of Microsoft Windows Rights Management Services (Windows RMS). The second component guarantees the security of revision of documents and was implementing equity and integration of an RFC 3161 compliant clients for the time stamp Protocol. Thus the DMS can communicate with an any also RFC compliant provider of qualified digital time-stamping and requesting a time stamp to a document at any time and stored together with the document in DMS.
