For the Kander and Simme watersheds are checking the amount of residual water in 2014 and if planned a rest water remediation. In the Kander and Simme lie the alluvial Kander Augand, Simme Augand, Wilerau, Br√ºnlisau and Niedermettlisau (natural reference without Restwasserbeinflussung). All areas of national importance or high eco-morphological value. For these areas, a sufficient heterogeneity and hydrological dynamics of meaning is in addition to a sufficient quantity of residual water. This study should contribute to determining to what extent the current amount of residual water are sufficiently endowed, and in particular whether a sufficient morphological and hydrological dynamics is given the heterogeneous elements of the landscape and the biodiversity of these landscapes maintain and promote. For this purpose, the research group eco-hydrology and geo-informatics developed a monitoring based on remote sensing to the quantitative spatial analysis by. She will be using drone, drain and GIS analysis of piezometer measurements hydrologische-and Habiatdynamik at different water levels and efficient ecosystem-level flood events recorded and evaluated. In addition, the terrestrial fauna (invertebrates) the two floodplains is studied to get a better picture of the current state.
