Foundation Swiss Press Council the IAM has the image of the Swiss Press Council I with a consequential analysis validated the results of quantitative study and deepened. The analysis of the qualitative interviews with 45 media professionals confirmed, inter alia, the assessment that the effect of the Press Council on the journalistic work is very low. So, for example, his professional code of ethics in everyday life is consulted hardly. However, the Press Council is perceived as a body that monitors fair, denounces violations of professional cultural rules and brings far more understanding of the daily work of the media due to his expertise as the justice and confronts as well a "juridification". Emerges from the study results also, that the respondents want an increased (communicative) presence of the Press Council in the editorial offices to strengthen the acceptance of the Panel and to promote the media-ethical discourse. Prof. Dr. Vinzenz Wyss (project management) and Lukas Tschopp, Communicator FH have carried out the research project.
