Health literacy (HL) can be understood as the general competence to retrieve and critically analyze information in order to take informed health decisions. There is convincing evidence that limited HL is associated with poor health/social outcomes and specific patterns of health service use. From an economic point of view there has been little research in the area. The purpose of our study is - to systematically review the literature dealing with limited HL, - to report the costs of limited HL both at the individual and community levels, - to give some insights into the costs of limited HL in the Swiss health care system.
