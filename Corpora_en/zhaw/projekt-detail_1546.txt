There are so far no studies of the history of PR for the Switzerland. Hedged statements about the development of the profession have but currently don't get. The professional field in the Switzerland was constituted at the beginning of the 1950s. 1954, a private PR publication that provides a variety of documents for task fields, and professional identity is found in the Switzerland. In addition can be found early series of works, which deal with public relations at a relatively high level of abstraction. Beyond a technical-historical value, such analyses have a knowledge value that explains why and under what conditions the existing became the become, where possibilities have been exhausted and barriers have limits, which led to the current style of the profession in the Switzerland.
