Connvision AG in this project is a framework designed to combine mobile tagging services flexibly and efficiently with location-based services (LBS). These are the mobile tags first geo positioned. With this geo-location, orstspezifische information from various LBS are collected in the Internet, aggregated and stored as meta information about the corresponding day. Also applications can store such day-specific meta information and make available to other applications. Thus, all new mobile tagging applications become possible.
