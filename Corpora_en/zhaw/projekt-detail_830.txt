Social (sustainability) issues gaining importance for companies: health, human rights, working conditions, diversity, poverty, corruption, etc. Services, providing businesses on these issues are defined in standards: mandatory standards (laws, regulations, etc.) and voluntary standards (E.g. UN Global Compact). Exist for environmental (sustainability) issues working tools with which companies can find out what standards they are relevant and how far these standards are adhered to; for social (sustainability) issues is largely lacking such tools. The project examines how far and how exactly companies ensure compliance with social standards.
