To developed a system for forecasting of traffic situations and times in private transport on the basis of real time tracking information. On the basis of the existing ASTRA online counting stations are finding this KTI project areas on the Swiss motorway network, where a traffic jam is possible and which have a sufficiently high economic and social importance. Then algorithms are developed, with whose help the online counting points information can be used for the prognosis of different sizes of traffic as the time of beginning of the jam and resolution or the length of the traffic jams. The forecast information may be transmitted via communication networks (E.g. Internet, mobile) to the user.
