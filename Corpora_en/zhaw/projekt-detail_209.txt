The cultivation of microalgae is currently the focus of various international research interests of wastewater treatment through the production of fuels and food to pharmaceutical agents. Also the school turns to this technology, and has approved an interdisciplinary project, in the framework of cross-Institute a micro algae product be developed (Kompetenzzentrum microalgae CCMA). The IUNR is involved in. Microalgae are also part of the action plan SCCER of the KTI. It emerges that the interest nationally and internationally will increase micro-algae in the near future. Research on micro-algae is often only in the laboratory scale. The IUNR, however, currently operates the only large bioreactor of Switzerland with the microalgae in a pilot scale can be cultured marine. Therefore, we have an interface with which it is us possible to carry, for example, in the context of applied research and development or teaching research for outside. For proof of the appropriate skills is necessary. We want to be the contact person who know all the details of the thylakoid cultivation, which can assist the cultivation advice questions and refining existing cultivation methods and developed new. This eco-technological principles should, take account in line with the strategy of the Institute, so that this biotechnology is making sustainable. In the framework of this project should be how various factors (nutrients, lighting, energy consumption, seasonality etc.) play together and thus to determine the efficiency of the system show. Finally, we would like to provide evidence that we can control the production and estimate the potential of cultivation of microalgae for different needs. It should data be collected and analyzed, ultimately be summarized in a document, which shows the key data of this cultivation method and interested partners envision leads the possibilities here.
