An industrialisierbares packaging for an implantable flow sensor will be developed in the laboratory network of the universities of Bern, Neuch√¢tel, Zurich and Eastern Switzerland. This flow sensor that should be used for children with hydrocephalus and arising was developed at EPFL within the framework of a CTI MedTech company MEDOS/Codman programme. The aim of the project is to realize an industrialisierbares packaging, which from the outset should take into account the needs of the ability to implant with existing technologies. Further, this project is to bring closer together the various partners of the laboratory network between the universities of applied sciences and allow a transfer of technology to the concrete example.
