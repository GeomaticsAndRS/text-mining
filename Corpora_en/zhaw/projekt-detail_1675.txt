The Caucasus Media Institute is a training centre for journalists in Yerevan, Armenia. It is sponsored by the Swiss development cooperation (SDC) since 2001. It offers courses for journalists, mainly from the South Caucasus, but also from other successor States of the Soviet Union. The Institute for applied media science (IAM) was commissioned by the SDC, as part of a larger team to conduct the evaluation of the Caucasus Media Institute (CMI). The media environment in the countries of Armenia and Georgia, as well as management, strategy and objectives of the training courses at the CMI have been evaluated. The project was completed in September 2004.
