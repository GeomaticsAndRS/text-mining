: 01.11.2009 project partners / project partner (s): PrivaSphere AG In a previous CTI project developed the automated security testing framework (ASTF). It permits the efficient testing of online applications with regard to safety. ASTF has proven itself and is today in some pilot projects with third-party companies in use. The first experience has shown also in practical usage and talks with company representatives, that for a really powerful product that enables the efficient and smooth use of ASTF for third-party companies for a wide range of applications, again a significant stage of development is necessary. This decisive step will be made in the framework of this KTI project.
