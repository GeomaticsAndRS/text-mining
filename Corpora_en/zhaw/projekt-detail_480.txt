The current back model, which is used in the laboratory of movement for kinematic analysis of the upper body should be improved first in two steps: (I) literature search / benchmarking should In part of a systematic literature search and by contacting other institutions are initially the existing models and checked for their suitability for the demands of the ZHAW and. The results serve as a basis for (II). (II) reliability based on the results of (I) is adapted to the existing model. This customized model reliability and the test - retest is checked as a next step the inter Tester reliability. Should be the reliability insufficient is the model again adjusted and checked. The project was successfully completed.
