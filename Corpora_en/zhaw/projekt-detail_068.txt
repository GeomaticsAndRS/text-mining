We examine how you can use new logging tools for Java programs, to automatically create regression test data and regression tests for productive system. Thus the risk and the cost should be minimized in the refactoring of software. Key points of the project are: here we will focus on the following aspects: 1 performance influence: the use of logging systems in productive programmes is only possible when this functionality and stability is not affected. We will examine what performance effects cause the various tools, and develop criteria, when and where they can be used - and when not. 2nd test data generation: by logging you know for the production operation, which methods are called, and what input and output values. For efficient regression tests, parts of the system must be gemockt (external services, databases, etc.). We will investigate how to automatically make equivalence classes and how you automatically can generate appropriate test cases and mock objects from the logging data. 3. implementation: We will implement a tool that can generate automatically appropriate regression testing and run.
