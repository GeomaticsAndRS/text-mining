The starting point of the present project is the OKP-explanation and prediction model on behalf of BAG/sant√©suisse/GDK. Methodologically, the present (Versicherer-) forecast model differs from the former model, because the records are sometimes different (datenpool for the first model, insurance data for the insurance model). As a result, adjustments in relation to missing observations and smaller datasets (less data base and/or less cantons) arise.
