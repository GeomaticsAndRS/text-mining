With the hydrothermal Carbonisation (HTC) is a greatly improved sludge mechanical dewatering ability achieved and the required thermal drying up now before the burning virtually lapses. The use of HTC leads to a marked improvement of the CO2 balance and a reduction of in costs. The industrial pilot plant of the company AVA CO2 improves the Carbonisation of sewage sludge, also creates a life cycle assessment and exploitation of process water and the recovery of phosphorus.
