Info flora of Switzerland within the framework of the project efficient determination algorithms were developed by the Institute for applied simulation with systematic scientific approach. They beat the traditional method in the determination of species (flora and fauna) and can be used in the future for more destination apps. With iGräser can be determined easily, quickly and reliably the 111 most common native forest and field grasses (Poaceae) of Switzerland not blossoming as well in the prosperous State. The determination using individually selected features in the areas of (1) location, (2) growth form, (3) height, (4) vegetative characteristics (leaves), (5) generative characteristics (flowers), or (6) systematics, including the dissemination of data via GPS location. The individual species are described in detail (pointer values, characteristics, dissemination in the Switzerland) and illustrates the relevant for determining characteristics with photos. Similar types and possibilities of confusion we explicitly pointed out. Sites of rare species can be simply stored via the tracking function. The app enables a mobile learning (E-learning) for students. The sustainable software framework developed by the IAS represents a valuable basis for the development of other, similarly structured apps along with the efficient destination algorithm.
