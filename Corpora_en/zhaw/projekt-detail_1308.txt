This meta-analysis systematically examined whether in patients with non-acute nonspecific low back pain treatment with movement therapy (exercise therapy) is effective as a treatment without movement therapy (usual care). A second question was what kind of exercise therapy has the best effectiveness. 2004 Kool has published a meta-analysis, which included 14 studies Jan already. Since since new publications have been published, an update of the meta-analysis was necessary. A systematic literature search was carried out in different databases and found studies were tested with a standardized 8 points on their methodological quality and scale. That exercise therapy is more effective than "usual care" and the sickness absences a year following treatment statistically significant and could be relevant reduced showed 17 of 23 found studies. What kind of exercise therapy is the most effective, not demonstrated however. The project was successfully completed.
