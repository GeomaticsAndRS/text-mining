A study carried out in the framework of the NRP 53 (chronic pain) showed that patients with a disability as a result of lumbar back pain the work absences significantly can be reduced in the following year by an intensive rehabilitation program in function-oriented. More than 50% of treated patients comes from South East Europe. It was unclear whether the treatment is optimally adapted to the patient. The aim of this study was to investigate the visibility of South-Eastern European patients on their lumbar back pain and their expectations of a function-oriented treatment. To do this, interviews were conducted with patients and the attending health professionals (HPs). The patients studied had nonspecific back pain on average 20 years. Many felt not understood due to their cultural background and the language barrier by HPs. You not considered contributing factors potentially to the back pain, psychological and social factors. They expected pain and a treatment that mainly is based on passive measures, such as in the country of origin, of the rehabilitation stay in the first place. Typically, this goal was not achieved. The fear of the financial, professional and health future are also very common. Based on the results of this study, a better early detection was recommended to avoid chronic disability. Improving communication through increased use of interpreters and HPs with foreign language skills is recommended in rehabilitation. Also the more intensive involvement of the social environment and the employer of the patients was recommended. The project was successfully completed.
