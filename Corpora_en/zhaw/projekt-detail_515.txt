Media appearances are always also appeared with and from themselves. They open up opportunities to get to know us more in a challenging environment and to develop. At the same time with every media appearance we influence how others perceive us - as a human being, as a scientist, as a representative of professional and College. Therefore it is worth attitudes to reflect knowledge and methods, and continue to expand, with which we make us publicly understood. We do just that in the media training:-we promote individual strengths for the communication modes of writing, speeches and presentations. -We practice examples from our professional practice; so we win respect, enjoyment and safety for our next media appearances. -In the transition to the self-coaching, we create freedom of movement in a rapidly evolving, increasingly mediatized world.
