It is estimated that the energy consumption by 30% could be reduced in Swiss companies. There is thus considerable energy-saving potential were only insufficiently exploited despite some intense efforts by economic and environmental associations, utility companies (EVU) and energy points of the cantons and municipalities today. In the project Negawatt instead of megawatts, SMEs are considered with a power consumption between 10 and 500 MWh per year. The technical potential for power savings in these SMEs is estimated at 5.7 TWh per year (approximately 10% of the power consumption in the Switzerland). In today's current costs about two-thirds of them (3.8 TWh per year) would be economically feasible.
