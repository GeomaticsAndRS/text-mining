So far an overview and a systematic evaluation of the products offered in this regard are missing, how they can support the residents in the self determination and execution of activities. A major study of the question is scheduled, how technical assistance can promote the self determination and execution of activities of residents in old-age and nursing homes. In this preliminary study is determined to which technical assistance specialists would accept in the homes under what conditions. A literature review and expert interviews are conducted.
