The Alp economy faces special challenges, because the small structured, laborious, but with many alpine plants under economic pressure to align new project AlpFutur. The tendency to the polarization of the Alp-economic use continues to increase, i.e. intensifying the hut near Willow parts and enter the secluded parts of the pasture, what these uniquely diverse cultural landscape negative affects. Targeted to control pending operating amalgamations, lack of practical, holistic decision-making instruments. Therefore, today's instruments with regard to relevance for sustainable landscape development and landscape quality will be examined and further developed. To do this, with an interview with cantonal experts examined in 2009/2010 the most relevant causes of operating consolidations and current control and checked for their future relevance. There are recommendations for a thief-related development of agricultural production and spatial planning instruments erarbeitet(2011/2012) it. It is the partial project 6 of the national research programme AlpFUTUR, which was completed in 2013 with the synthesis paper. The project was completed with two ZHAW reports in 2013.
