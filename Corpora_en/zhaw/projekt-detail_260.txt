Hemorrhage is a significant complication during major liver surgery. Beside of specific surgical procedures to avoid unnecessary bleeding during liver resection, pharmacological pre- and postconditioning have shown to be a hepatoprotective strategy in randomized controlled trials and substantially reduced overall complication rate. However, little is known about the health-economic effects of these strategies to avoid complications. The Institute of Anesthesiology of the University Hospital of Zurich has approached the Winterthur Institute of Health Economics, Zurich University of Applied Sciences, to assess the health-economic effects of these interventions in their patients.
