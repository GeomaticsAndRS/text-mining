In cooperation with Siemens business services, a software tool was developed with the for an arbitrary stochastic demand process by means of a simulation-based procedure optimum points of order and quantities can be determined. The tool is based on a new method for the description of the ordering process. Instead of a description as a result (adopted in the rule as a normally distributed) daily, weekly, or monthly amounts, dissolved the order process in the individual purchase orders and a stochastic model used for this (compound Poisson process). Using this approach has some serious advantages. In particular it is possible to correctly describe both fast - and slow-rotating products with the same approach. The scheduling tool allows the full cost calculation a storage strategy, taking into account storage costs, transport costs, discounts, etc. It is based not on a simplified analytical calculation, but on a simulation of the actual ordering process. An automatic optimization function of shoulders reorder point and the optimal order quantity can be thus for each product determined.
