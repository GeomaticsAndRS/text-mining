Federal Office for the environment in five locations of the navel network measured ammonia (NH3) continuously since 2006 with the photo-acoustic measuring method. Initial evaluations showed peak loads, of which it has been suggested that they were caused by local nearby events such as for example Düngeaktivitäten of farmers or plume of barns and Güllelagern again and again. Aim of this study was to investigate whether can be closed from the history of the NH3 concentrations on the type of emission source. Especially interested, which observed peaks of the spreading of manure and manure to fields, and which can be associated with the plume of stationary sources. In a second step the share of emissions should be estimated for the considered sites, which was caused by the local application of slurry and manure. Because the information about the Düngeaktivitäten in various places were too sketchy, no conventional statistical analysis in the form of a random forest analysis or a logistic regression could be carried out. By comparing the Immissions measurements with the logs to the output of the farm fertiliser typical pollution gradients could be constructed however using air hygiene and statistical arguments and by comparison with literature data, which are to be expected after spreading of manure in the vicinity. Analog considerations were also made to the pollution gradients, which are influenced by emitting stationary sources. Using regular expressions (regular expressions) these patterns were sought in the existing emission data and the found events compared to the logged.
