In the framework of this project, an application for funding will be developed from the results of the completed study to the readability and comprehensibility of medical bills (usability testing). Medical bills under the conditions of the Swiss "tarmed", as the usability tests have shown, are very difficult to read and understand. Lexically and structurally it is texts with high density (keyword: Matrix structure of the table, high density of specialised vocabulary, economic and medical terms, high density of abbreviations). Aim of the research project for applying will be establishing bases for an optimisation of the text type.
