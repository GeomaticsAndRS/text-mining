ZHAW F E examined the physical strain for helicopter pilots that fly with an external load (under load) and a "bubble" (a bulge in the side window). In this bubble, the pilot refuses to have a vertical view of the load. It is believed that lead to symptoms of the musculoskeletal system and specifically the lumbar and cervical spine this unbalanced load, which affected flight safety. Using quantitative (specific questionnaire, workplace analysis) and qualitative methods (interviews with pilots), were recorded in the complaints and safety concerns. The results were interpreted and summarised in a report. The project was successfully completed.
