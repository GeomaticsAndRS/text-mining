The carnavi company has grown in recent years through acquisitions. A new operating concept will be implemented in the next few years. The Executive Board of the carnavi wants to ensure that the IT Department and the ITC infrastructure is up to the challenges caused by this new operating concept. The Institute for applied information technology of the ZÃ¼rcher Hochschule Winterthur was tasked to create a report that examined the strengths and weaknesses in terms of the new operating concept and lists measures to resolve.
