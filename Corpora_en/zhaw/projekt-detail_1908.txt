Disc degeneration can be very painful. The current treatment is currently in a complete removal of the painful disc. The missing tissue is a prosthesis or bone (= fusion) is replaced. Both treatments are neither biological nor they can maintain a normal function of the intervertebral discs. The aim of this research project is based on the development of a biological replacement of intervertebral disc by the body's cells. The cells to grow in an automated process on an organic material and can be implanted through an arthroscopic surgery in the intervertebral disc.
