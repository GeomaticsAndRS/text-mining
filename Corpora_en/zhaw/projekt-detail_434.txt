For the first time, the space-time system will be investigated by wild ungulates and humans at the same time and in the same room. In the wildlife, a novel system is to capture the heart rate to use. Thus, we want to determine how human activities or Measures affect the behaviour of wild ungulates and their limitation which outer and inner reactions they evoke these. The following questions are grouped together to address: How do visiting in space and time? What is the space-time behavior of wild ungulates deer and red deer in the wilderness park Zürich and its surroundings? How are the activity rhythm, the use of space and the physiology of the wild hoofed animals affected by the different forms of use by visiting the wilderness park? The results represent an excellent basis for the revision of visitor management Zurich for the wilderness park, as is required by the target frame for Naturerlebnispärke. The study provides arguments and illustrative examples for the awareness-raising and public information and thus contributes to the acceptance and the long-term existence of protected areas.
