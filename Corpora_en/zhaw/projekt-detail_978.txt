The Institute of language in business and education at the ZHAW has in cooperation with the Centre orality PHZ train in 2010 designed an E-learning course for FH students and other interested adults and realized. The electronic learning medium is linguistically-oriented and thus clearly differs from the numerous psychologically-oriented offerings in the area of oral communication. The project was supported with funds of the CSPC in the amount of CHF 30,000. The didaktisierten concepts from the applied linguistics of the conversation and the appropriate exercises can be used both in addition to the traditional classroom and self-study (blended learning). The E-learning course contains currently six modules, which consist of short theoretical inputs and practical exercises.

An extension of the existing E-learning course is planned on 2011/2012.
