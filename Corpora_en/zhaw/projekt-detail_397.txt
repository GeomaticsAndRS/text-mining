Most who change their frequency as a function of the bound mass are quartz crystal biosensors. Be passed by bacteria on the bio sensor and specifically bind to a receptor, the sensor can register the presence of the bacteria in real time. These systems are suitable to detect microbial contamination. In this project are characterized specific receptors for the detection of microorganisms and the detection limits for selected bacteria.
