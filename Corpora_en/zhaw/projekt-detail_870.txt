The Minschuns is a major infrastructure facility for winter tourism in the Val MÃ¼stair. The main lifts are two double rope tows and a platter lift serves as a shuttle from the parking lot to the ski area. The access to the ski area is hampered by the snow-covered road from the Ofenpass road and the rather challenging for inexperienced platter lift. Pro Minschuns aims of the construction of a new feeder system of Tschierv after Minschuns as well as the development of new water sources and expansion of snowmaking. The project is modular and contains a broad approach with a comment relevance matrix up to a detailed preliminary study.
