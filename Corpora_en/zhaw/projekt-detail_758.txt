Traditional storage of terminology (dictionaries but also terminology databases) are always clearer boundaries in terms of benefits, management and usability. New opportunities for the creation of ontologies as formal description of terms and their relationships to one another (Ontoterminologie) and the collaborative work of terminology (wikis, social tagging). The aim of the project is criteria and ways of preparation and appearance to explore data (knowledge presentation), which can be useful in terminology management by companies as well as the structuring of linguistic tools or reference books for translators and interpreters. The questions are thus: how is the development of the terminological database (terminological database) to the knowledge base (knowledge base)? How can terminology collections, glossaries, texts, etc. are classified? How can ontologies (representation of knowledge relations) look for these purposes? How can a collaborative terminological knowledge base be made?
