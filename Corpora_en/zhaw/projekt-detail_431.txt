If one considers future developments as the increasing urbanization and compaction of cities as well as the new consumer and demand needs, is that cities will be confronted in the future a further increase in goods flows significantly. A possible solution is the bundling of shipments of various logistics service provider in the area of collection and delivery, with the aim of the many single tickets that exist, to reduce pooling and to employ as low-emission and noise-reduced vehicles for the dispersion. Some cities and logistics service providers have the potential of broadcast bundling recognized worldwide and are already working on future-oriented solutions. Each project or each "shipment bundling problem" must be considered in specific and any city or town must find the optimal solution for you or the appropriate mix of the ideal location and number of distribution centers, the number of the used electric vans and loads wheels for the dispersion, etc.. But before measures can be implemented, all projects are facing the same problem: it must be first modelled the different alternatives and analyzed according to their impact on cost, environmental impact, traffic, noise, etc.. The internal project aims to develop a methodology which systematises these issues and provides a multidimensional analysis of the decision problem "Broadcast bundling". Using this methodology a modeling to can be made initially of decision alternatives (regarding the above questions) and affiliated with the help of a simulation of the operation and distribution processes a quantitative impact assessment of the various alternatives in relation to the targets costs, transport times and routes, traffic and environmental issues.
