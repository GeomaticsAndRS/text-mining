In the branch plants of DaimlerChrysler, many are carried semi and fully automated processing steps where typically several physical quantities are recorded and monitored by SPC (statistical process control). Usually, the SPC it is to check whether it lies within the tolerance range for each measured value. If the values are outside, alarm is sounded. An extension of the approach is that not only a static verification is performed but a dynamic: it examines the temporal behavior of values. The following abnormalities can be distinguished: • continuous drift values (E.g. by the continuous wear of machine parts), • jumps in the expected value (E.g. After replacement of a part of the machine) • increased variance (a part of the machine has arrived at the end of life and therefore permits no production of constant quality more) • runaways: a few values are outside the range of values of the majority of the values, which are temporally close. The latter may indicate an irregularity in the manufacturing process, which occurs only "once". The aim of the project was the development of a new SPC algorithm, which can detect the four above mentioned peculiarities. Essentially robust estimates were used for the realization of expected value and variance.
