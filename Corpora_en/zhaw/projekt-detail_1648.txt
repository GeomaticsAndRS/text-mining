The Swiss television SF performs a Textcoaching in the framework of quality management to the 10vor10 editorial. It can accompany the creation of the texts on the spot and – where this is not possible - take the linguistic quality of the broadcast posts under the magnifying glass. Be specifically noted in this interplay of coaching and product review the following problem areas: times - and statement logic, portion of information, streamlining of statements, focusing by means of language, as well as congruence. The results of coaching and the language analysis of the broadcast will be presented daily in the editorial meetings and discussed with the journalists and journalists. It connects the individual coaching: the writers adopt new strategies, to master the visible made difficulties deliberately – and soon – routinely.
