The Institute of Public Management has conducted several national (e.g. Swiss Federal Administration, Canton of Zurich) and international (e.g. Chile, Indonesia, Russia, Brasil, PAHO, EU-Commission)projects with regard to the implementation of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), aiming to support (non-)governmental bodies on all state levels in introducing and implementing accrual based accounting standards. It therefore offers various forms of academical and practical support, as for example study-tours, training seminars, Gap Analysis or review of IPSAS training centers.
