The project has aimed to show the state-of-the-art simulation technology as well as the currently available simulation tools or group of simulation tools and their typing. It should be examined which issues in transport and in transport planning are relevant and where, how and for what were / simulation tools used so far in the traffic and transportation and what experiences. From this, the costs and the benefits of simulation to be parsed. The question should be pursued which simulation tools for problem-solving in the freight traffic and transport planning can contribute and where their applications and limits lie. Finally, be interested in the conclusions and recommendations, which are for the use of simulation tools in freight traffic - and transport planning derive.
