Federal Office for environmental emission measurements of ammonia are an important instrument of the evaluation on the implementation of measures to reduce of ammonia emissions under the current agricultural in the Switzerland. Since mid-1999, funded ammonia measurements are therefore made by the FOEN and the cantons. The so-called ZÃ¼rcher passive samplers were used at the beginning of the measurements, which were replaced in 2004 by Radiello passive samplers. The two methods were compared in the herein project. The required data were from a measurement campaign from 2003 to 2007, in which at eight locations with both methods at the same time was measured. At five sites of the ammonia concentrations were determined in addition by Minidenudern. The statistical analyses showed that the differences between the three measurement methods depend the location of the measurements. Because the location dependency could not be attributed to commonly known sizes, no generally applicable procedures could be developed so that, which can be applied regardless of location. It is therefore recommended not to use the data collected with the Zurich passive samplers for trend analysis. As a by-product of this work standard deviation and coefficient of variation could be determined for multiple measurements by means of Radiello passive samplers for the first time as a (continuous) function of the ammonia concentration.
