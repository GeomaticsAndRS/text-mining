The student of English in the Department is planning an excursion economics and management to Britain in the autumn of 2002. Constructive impulses of our Student Council, and the Department should be raised by the excursion. Visit one or two comparable colleges in the UK to fertilize the perspective on their own work. Especially the handling is to positively influence the development of the student with new forms of teaching and learning. As potential side effects to strengthen team-building within the student of English and the extension of the cultural horizon should affect. A report about the excursion appeared in the ZHW info from August 2003.
