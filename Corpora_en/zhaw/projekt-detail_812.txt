Drug development and testing of the active ingredient can no longer rely tests with cells in combination with animal experiments on konvertionelle in vitro. New technologies that better represent the function and structure of healthy and diseased tissues and organs, are gaining ground. Such organotypic tissue models enable a holistic in vitro testing, the of the in vivo situation in the body much closer than previous methods. However, these technologies still in an early development phase are that such micro-fabric used in the pharmaceutical industry. Developments for the controlled and standardized production, preservation, storage, shipping, quality control, as well as new methods of analysis are required to realize the full potential of this technology. To contribute significantly to the development and implementation of this key technology, it is therefore necessary to further develop the existing competencies and to draw up clearly defined quality standards. In addition, it is essential to concentrate the expertise of academia and industry. Rather than taking small research efforts in various places, we want to strengthen the cooperation between basic research, applied research and industry. Aim is the creation of a competence centre for artificial tissue under the leadership of the University of applied sciences (ZHAW). It generates a platform on the technology for the pharmaceutical industry and the personalised medicine matures out. The FH is the preferred F E-partner.
