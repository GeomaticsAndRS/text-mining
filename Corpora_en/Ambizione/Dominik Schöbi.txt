Lead Lay summary The main goal of the project is to assess and analyze how close partners co-regulate their affective experiences as they occur in daily life, and how they are affected by these processes. Close partners spend an important part of their lives together, while they spend an at least as important part outside the private setting. As a result, they are required to effectively regulate the affective experiences they make inside and outside the home in order to successfully manage their family life experiences. The importance of affective experiences, such as conflict, social support, or stress at work and its spillover into the relationship, for the well-being of close partners and their children has been broadly documented. However, relatively little empirical research has studied such events as they occur in daily life, and rarely has this research adapted a comprehensive theoretical perspective. In addition, a linkage between daily life processes and the long-term development of individual and interpersonal well-being has been widely assumed, but only very few studies include assessments of short-term and long-term processes as such in a single study, to adequately assess this linkage. The current study aims to fill this gaps by combining the assessment of daily affect co-regulation processes with the repeated assessment of individual and interpersonal well-being over 18 months. This will allow to assess how couples deal with their own and their partner's daily experiences, how these processes differ depending on individuals' characteristics and dyadic personality matches , and whether such differences can explain differences in individual and interpersonal development. A secondary goal of this project is to advance the use of computer-assisted ambulatory assessment methodology.
