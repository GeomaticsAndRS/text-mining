Lead Lay summary The capability of synapses to undergo plastic changes in their strength represents the cellular basis of learning, a process that is well characterized in brain areas involved in cognition and memory, e.g. cortex and hippocampus. The role of synaptic plasticity is so far relatively unexplored in brain centers that participate in the generation of sleep-waves, such as the thalamic nuclei, that are thought to operate in a stereotyped manner. However, the rhythmic electrical activity underlying sleep-waves is highly susceptible to changes, with its intensity varying according to recent sleep-wake behavior. Moreover, distinct sleep rhythms have been implied in distinct aspects of memory consolidation, indicating that diverse forms of plasticity occur in the brain circuits during sleep. Finally, disruption of sleep-waves is observed in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease, which are frequently associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. This suggests a common mechanistic origin for abnormal sleep and cognitive disorders. We will study the impact of synaptic plasticity on the thalamocortical system during sleep rhythms and its role in regulating sleep-waves. We have identified a Ca2+-channel subtype in a thalamic nucleus that is responsible for the generation of sleep spindles, a hallmark of NREM sleep. The presence of this unique Ca2+ source at intrathalamic connections together with NMDA receptors, a classical trigger of synaptic plasticity, could serve as a molecular substrate for plasticity within sleep centers. Electrophysiological and electroencephalographic analyses will be conducted on rodents to unravel the role of these candidate molecules in sleep generation and regulation. Our study will contribute to a better understanding of sleep physiology and, ultimately, will provide new pharmacological targets to improve the beneficial effects of sleep on memory and cognitive performance.
