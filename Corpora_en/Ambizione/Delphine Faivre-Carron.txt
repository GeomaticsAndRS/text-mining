Lead Lay summary This project primarily aims at bringing to light Ptolemy of Lucca's original and pioneering contribution to the birth of systematic debate on the major questions and concepts of Western Political Philosophy. Political thought had become a discipline in its own right after the Latin translation of Aristotle's Politics in the middle of the thirteenth century and its introduction into the university curriculum, and it developed considerably during the great historical conflict between temporal powers (kings and emperors) and spiritual ones (above all, the popes). Ptolemy of Lucca, a Dominican philosopher and theologian active in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, participated actively in this debate starting in 1280, defending unequivocally the supremacy of papal over imperial power. Not only does Ptolemy defend his position with extensive argumentation, following the scholastic method of arguing pro et contra , but he also brings in elements that have been traditionally called pro-republican, specifically in connection with the ancient Roman Republic and the city-republics of late-thirteenth century Italy. While in themselves Ptolemy's writings deserve close philosophical study, their place as one of the founders of the tradition of political writings, coupled with this unexpected and unparalleled usage of republican themes, makes such a study imperative. Therefore, my project consists in two distinct but complementary parts: on the one hand, the preparation of a critical edition, with translation and commentary, of Ptolemy's first treatise, the De iurisdictione imperii et auctoritate summi pontificis ; on the other hand, the development of a doctrinal study of Ptolemy's thought in relation to contemporary or later thinkers, such as Engelbert of Admont, Jean Quidort, Dante Alighieri and Marsilius of Padua.
