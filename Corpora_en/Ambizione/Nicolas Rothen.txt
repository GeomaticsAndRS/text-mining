Lead Lay summary Lead: Under certain conditions synaesthesia - concurrent sensory experiences - leads to an advantage in memory performance. It is the aim of the current research project to shed some more light on the question why synaesthetes show any memory performance advantage at all. Background: Synaesthesia is a condition in which ordinary stimuli trigger extraordinary sensory experiences. For example, in grapheme-colour synaesthesia a printed letter in black elicits a red colour experience. Synaesthetic experiences are characterised as idiosyncratic, consistent over time, automatically triggered and having an early onset in live. Today it is clear, synaesthesia is neither imagination nor is it metaphorical thinking, instead it has a neurological basis. Thus, it seems as if synaesthetes have a richer world of experiences, which may function as additional memory cues. Previous studies have shown that under certain conditions synaesthetic experiences lead to an advantage in memory performance. However, to date the specific performance advantage is not well characterised in terms of cognitive and neuroscience models of memory and it is not clear why synaesthetes show any memory advantage at all. Aim: It is the aim of the present research project to characterise the memory performance advantage of synaesthetes in terms of cognitive and neuroscience models of memory. Moreover, the current research project aims to shed some more light on the question why synaesthetes show any memory advantage at all. Meaning: On a general level, the current research project has the potential for understanding the influence of perceptual conditions on higher order cognitive functions (e.g. memory). Since there are always large individual differences in perception, it is important to learn more about the influence of perception on higher cognitive functions. It is the goal of this project to evaluate these influences by the means of a population with a specific perceptual condition.
