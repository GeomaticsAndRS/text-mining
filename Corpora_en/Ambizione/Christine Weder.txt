Lead lay summary the project examines the thematic and formal representation of sexuality in a wide range of literary texts? 1968?, i.e. between the late of 1950s and the late of 1970s, and konstelliert them on the one hand with the intensely theoretical discussions to? sexual revolution? and on the other hand with literature and art-theoretical contributions of at the time. Shown in the first step, maintained the callings of sexuality, art and literature to? 68? a remarkably close relationship: The sexual theoretical writings use the artistic field for their diagnoses, postulates and ideals; Conversely, a clear tendency towards the Sexualization is recognizable in the aesthetic theories and Sciences. In the and at the same time against the context of this double relationship, the literary texts of that time are read in the second step and analyzed in their ever specific themeing and way of presentation where the literature with respect to the theoretical stresses from both sides proves often contrary. The investigation, which is interdisciplinary and comparative aimed at German-speaking emphasis, takes into account a broad, not on the?Achtundsechziger? Canon limited spectrum of texts, complemented by exemplary references to other media (especially performance and film), and a proven cultural or historical discourse extended the similar to the optics of the literature for the views of a relatively recent past,?Classic? such analyses (ESP. the fifth time around 1800) as a break time. This is also a new impulse for the historiography of literature: while the literature about? 68? so far mainly in the question after a politicization been considered is, argues the present project that the focus of sexualization is at least as fruitful.
