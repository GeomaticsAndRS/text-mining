Lead for a significant part, repeats d? expressions between the different? works of Claudian, latin poet tardo-antique, result d? a approach of rewriting and constitute a fact d? relevant self-reference for l? interpretation. They contribute to l? image that Darryl gives himself to his audience thus qu? messages panegyrics and policies qu? it transmits. Lay summary content and objectives remote repetition d? expressions in l?work d? a same author is? Similarly that the repetition of patterns or situations? a characteristic feature of the Greek and Roman epic poetry. This project aims to specify, within the major political poems of Claudian (composed and recited between 395 and 404 a.d. J.-C.), how this phenomenon arises d? a approach Rewriter and constitutes a fact d? relevant self-reference for l? interpretation.) He share d? a general review of the phenomenon of repetition (extent and distribution, forms, variations), leading to a thorough study of the specific phenomenon of rewriting (extent and distribution, technical, meaning for l? interpretation). It focuses particularly on rehearsals that appear d? a poem to l?, so d? observe their relationship with the technique poetic Claudian and with its messaging panegyrics and political in the context of the high Roman aristocracy and the Court of l? empire d?West.   CONTEXT L? the Claudian case study offers a Latin substantive reflection on the phenomenon of rewriting in epic poetry. It also brings new insights on the literary aspects of sound? work, which was often submitted in priority to questions of historical nature. Identification of rehearsals is a computer tool under development, which opens up entirely new perspectives for the comparison of the texts. Methodological and theoretical project lessons are likely to find applications in research on d? other types of poetry.
