Lead lay summary the somatostatin-based radio peptide therapy was developed in 1997 in Basel, and is nowadays well established therapy for Neuroendocrine tumors. Their main toxicity is the kidney toxicity, which limited the possibilities of application of this form of therapy. A controllability of pharmacokinetics in somatostatin-based radio peptide therapy could however reduce the renal toxicity and thus expand the range of applications of the therapy. Nanoparticles are particles, the diameter of which is a red blood cells in approximately one hundredth. You have loaded up with drugs and are widely used nowadays, to transport Therapeutics in the body at the location of the desired effect. The current project aims to control nano-particles with the established somatostatin-based radio peptides to load, better to its distribution in the body. A cell model is developed for this purpose, the somatostatin receptor - the target receptor of somatostatin-based radio peptide therapy. The stability, cellular, as well as the possible toxicity of developed radioactive nanoparticles be tested with these cells. The cells be injected also mice under the skin so that there a tumor developed, which also carries the somatostatin receptor. The distribution of the radioactive particles of nano, as well as the ability to Tumorbidgebung and therapy will be tested in this mouse model. The successful completion of the project could potentially allow the somatostatin-based radio peptide therapy in patients who have currently no therapeutic option. Furthermore, an established and tested Nano particle platform with other medications can be loaded, and thus open up the possibility of a combination therapy.
