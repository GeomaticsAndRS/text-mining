Lead the modelling of river flows is a key tool for the management of water, e.g. for protection against floods. These models must describe natural processes (rain, flow of water in the soil) which show a strong spatial variability due e.g. to topography, geology, or occupation of the ground. Observed reference data, including weather data, are generally scarce. Thus, these models can prove unreliable. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work: we propose in this research project to study the reliability of hydrological models of conceptual type, i.e. models that simulate natural highly simplified way processes in describing the behavior of the basins watershed as a set of tanks which fill and empty in response to rain or snowmelt. It is this type of models that is currently most often used for water management. The main objective of our research is to understand under what conditions these simple models can give reliable results in terms of prediction of time series of rates, particularly in environments where the snow plays a decisive role in the hydrological cycle. This analysis is based on two basic steps: i) the analysis of the relationship between the statistical properties of precipitation (rain and snow) and the occurrence of dominant hydrological processes and ii) analysis of the complexity required of the hydrological model to reproduce the temporal variability of fluxes observed. Scientific and socio-economic research project context: this research project will lead to a better understanding of the reliability of hydrological models that are currently used at different levels of water management, both at the administrative level (Federal and cantonal) level of the offices of engineering and operating of water companies. Through a regular exchange with the circles concerned, these results will directly contribute to the improvement of the current hydrological models.
