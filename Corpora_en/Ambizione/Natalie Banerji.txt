Lead we live in a world which needs energy. The Sun is an inexhaustible source, but that is not always easy to harvest. The development of solar cells that convert light into electricity, is therefore essential. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work the solar cells typically found in trade are inorganic silicone based. Their production is costly in money and energy. New generations of solar cells have therefore been developed. There are those so-called plastic. They consist primarily of organic compounds (conjugated polymers, fullerenes) and are made with cheap processes. They are also lightweight and flexible. L? efficiency plastic solar cells now approaching 10%. They thus become commercially interesting, but still need to be improved. To do this, the interaction between photovoltaic compounds and light, as well as the current generation electric, must be better understood. In this project, we use spectroscopy resolved at the time and the photocurrent measurements for better understanding of plastic solar cells. It is three main parts to this research: 1) only conjugated polymers in solution or solid state. End to better understand the excited state (resulting from the absorption of light) and its evolution in time, chemical series polymer and the model compounds are studied. (2) conjugated polymers mixed with fullerenes in the solid state. It forms a material that allows the conversion of light into electrical charges, but the mechanism is not well understood. We use extremely fast spectroscopy (femtosecond). Additional information are obtained in different spectral regions (visible, infrared, terahertz). (3) spectroscopic study of solar cell market. This allows to study the macroscopic photocorant and evolution of the loads scale femtosecond, in parallel. Scientific and social context of the research project the results of this research will contribute to the targeted development of new materials for organic solar cells more efficient.
