Lead suffers one of six stroke patients another stroke within 5 years. It is essential to identify the root cause of the event had to take place quickly and correctly to prevent a second stroke. Blood biomarker that can help to improve the determination of the cause would be a non-invasive elegant option. Lay summary background: unfortunately not found the definitive cause of stroke had held despite detailed additional diagnosis in up to 39% of cases, so that a large proportion of patients can be treated optimally.Â  Some promising blood biomarker which could distinguish between various stroke causes have been identified already in pilot projects. So far these have not been tested but still systematically in an appropriate clinical trial designed for this very issue. Content and purpose of the research project: The planned study we want to evaluate prospectively the most promising blood biomarkers in a large international multi-center study with 3000 stroke patients. (In detail, we will examine whether these biomarkers are associated with the occurrence of a second stroke and whether you are associated with the two most important treatable causes of a stroke) the cardio embolisch stroke, and b caused) stroke due to atherosclerosis of the brain-supplying vessels. Scientific and social context of the research project: the planned study is we can answer, whether the selected blood biomarkers with an increased risk of suffering another stroke, associated, and if you can help identify of those patients, for which there are established specific treatment, to improve. If this association can be confirmed it will be possible using the measurement of this blood biomarker specific to treat more patients and prevent thus further strokes. This would have a large impact on the survival and quality of life of patients with stroke.
