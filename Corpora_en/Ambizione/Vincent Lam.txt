Lead the nature of the fundamental entities in the physical world as well as the relationship between material d? a side and l? space and time l? other are among the most central in analytic philosophy of nature. In the perspective d? a scientific realism, the quantum theory and the theory of general relativity are the best guides about these issues. Lay summary the lack of d? a unified framework, quantum field theory and the theory of general relativity are most of the time considered and interpreted independently l? a l? other. Such an interpretative strategy can provide a coherent metaphysical conception with the fundamental features of current physical descriptions of the material, l? space and time. Content and objective of the work of research L? main objective of this project is d? a coherent understanding of fundamental physical entities and their relationship to l? space and time, taking into account the quantum nature of such fundamental material entities described by the theory of quantum fields and the dynamic nature of the spatio-temporal structure and gravity as described by the theory of general relativity. On the basis of these fundamental physical traits? in particular the quantum nonlocality, and the dynamic nature of l? space-time? This project investigates and develops a relational conception of fundamental physical entities in the context of structural realism ontological. Scientific and social context of the research project this project s? registered in the recent revival of the analytic metaphysics of science. He took part in an overall philosophical approach aimed at a better understanding of nature described by science.
