Lead human reasoning is an extraordinary but fallible tool. In order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses, we propose d? examine the reasoning in its social, argumentative and cultural context. Rather than focus on the individual thinker, this project aims therefore to measure l? effect of culturally transmitted arguments and debates on the operation and the results of the reasoning. Lay summary psychologists who study human reasoning discovered many biases and shortcomings in its functioning. Despite these flaws, the reasoning is responsible for some of the most extraordinary inventions of l? human species. This seeming paradox disappears when l? one takes into account the social, argumentative and cultural context in which reasoning takes place. For example, c? is because scientists debate about their theories and qu? they benefit from the arguments accumulated by their predecessors that science has his way. Unfortunately, psychologists of reasoning have focused their work on solitary reasoners solving abstract problems, which partly explains their negative findings. When members receive arguments d? others? for example, when? they discuss in group? they have much better results. The first objective of this project is to better understand l? influence of different social factors, and in particular l? d Exchange? arguments, on the functioning of the reasoning. To a certain extent, moral psychology studies suffer from the same problem. Because? they are concentrated on the isolated reasoner, they concluded that the reasoning n? had qu? limited an impact on morality. We will try to show qu? instead, when people discuss, reasoning can have an important influence on moral judgements. This project aims to better understand l? influence qu? have social, argumentative and cultural contexts on the reasoning. Beyond theoretical questions about the practical stakes are also high, the reasoning in a group with significant potential for policy and l? education.Â
