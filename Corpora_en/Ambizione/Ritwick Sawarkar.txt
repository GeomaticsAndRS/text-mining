Lead Lay summary Personalized medicine is a futuristic mission that prescribes medicine to individuals tailored for their own genetic make-up. However, much is yet to be understoof about how one's genetic make-up (genotype) gives rise to individual's properties such as disease susceptibility (phenotype). This genotype-phenotype correlation is hard to assess in complex organisms such as mice and human, but relatively simple in the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster. This proposal makes use of this model system in order to mechanistically understand genotype-phenotype relation. Specifically, the project revolves around a molecular chaperone called heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The proposal derives its inspiration from a hypothesis that Hsp90 constrains phenotypic outcome of genetic variation in natural populations. The work will be based on our recent finding that Hsp90, along with its cytosolic role, also resides at promoters of several genes in the fly genome.Â  Thus the proposal combines a deep social and biomedical interest in personalized medicine, with amenable model systems like the fruit-fly and a specific molecular question concerning Hsp90. Moreover, we will implement several Hsp90 drugs that are currently in phase III clinical trial for cancer therapy to study their effects on the fruit-fly morphology.
