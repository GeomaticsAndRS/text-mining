Lead the southern Levant is a region key to understand the interactions between l?Man and his environment. However, the sedimentary archives that would compel past environmental changes are for l? very fragmentary moment to the driest areas of the region. In this context, the discovery in a desert area of Jordan, much organic matter-rich sedimentary sequences preserved and continuous, opens new perspectives. Lay summary content and objectives research work this project proposes d? analyse organic sequences discovered in Jordan, near the dead sea, to extract environmental data covering at least a large part of l?Holocene (which includes him 11'500 years). This study is multi-traceurs: it provides d? use different indicators, in particular the pollen content, but also plant fragments or (macrofossils) seeds preserved in the sediment. coal, witness of local or regional lamps; the spores of fungi, which some grow preferentially on manure d? herbivore (presence of herds). The data obtained on these organic sequences from the vicinity of the dead sea can be compared with information extracted Paleoenvironmental d? other sequences, organic and carbonate (limestone deposits around sources), also present in the region. Scientific and social context of the research project the Paleoenvironmental data obtained during this project will provide a clearer picture of l? environmental evolution of arid environments of the southern Levant. They will be implemented in parallel with l? evolution of human communities in the region (in particular the major societal event your than the development of l? agriculture, l? irrigation, l? appearance and the disappearance of large centres d? housing), and will allow better understanding of the anthropogenic and climate share in past environmental changes. They may also be compared with the climate models developed for the East Mediterranean area.
