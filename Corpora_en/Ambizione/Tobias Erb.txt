Lead Lay summary Carboxylases belong to one of the most important classes of enzymes in nature because they catalyze the fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic compounds, an essential prerequisite for all life on earth. This study aims at  exploring the structure-function relationship of a novel CO2- fixing enzyme  to understand the enzyme's biochemistry in greater detail. This knowledge will be useful to design synthetic carboxylases by introducting the carboxylating function into other protein scaffolds. Moreover, the physiological role of the novel CO2-fixing enzyme in its natural pathway will be investigated in this study. The goal is to identify important environmental and cellular factors that determine in which cases selected organisms use this novel CO2-fixing enzyme and to understand how much the novel carboxylase contributes to the global carbon cycle . In a third project,  the novel CO2-fixing enzyme will be used to create de novo (?synthetic?) CO2-fixation pathways in selected microorganisms. This ambitious long-term goal aims at designing customized novel CO2 fixation pathways that overcome any historical and evolutionary burden. The results of this study will unravel the details of a new principle of enzymatic carboxylation and exploit their biotechnological potential . In addition, this work will extend our understanding of bacterial central carbon metabolism on both organismic and global scales. Finally, the successful design of a functional synthetic CO2 fixation pathway will be a hallmark in synthetic biology. This will provide the exciting possibility to develop new biotechnological tools that might find their application in industry or environmental protection .
