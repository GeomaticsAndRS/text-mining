Lead Lay summary The analysis of the air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice has revealed that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have varied in step with atmospheric temperatures and global ice volume over the glacial/interglacial (G/IG) cycles of the last 800,000 years. Model calculations suggest that these CO2 variations played a key role in the energy balance of the climate system that could represent up to half of the forcing governing G/IG climate change. Hence, the study of the relationship between atmospheric CO2 and climate across the G/IG transitions of the Pleistocene can provide important insights on the present-day and future response of the Earth system to anthropogenic forcing. However, after several decades of research the ultimate cause of G/IG variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are not completely understood. In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that a successful explanation of the full G/IG atmospheric CO2Â change relies on a combination of physical and biogeochemical processes occurring in the Southern Ocean that are involved in the regulation of the deep ocean carbon reservoir, which include changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, carbonate chemistry, air/sea gas exchange and marine biological productivity. The overall objective of this project is to investigate the main Southern Ocean processes driving changes in the marine carbon cycle though time, and assess their role in modulating atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. The project aims to provide new insights into these questions by applying a multidisciplinary approach that combine the generation of new biomarker and microfossil-bound N isotopes records covering the last G/IG cycle in previously unexplored regions of the SO.
