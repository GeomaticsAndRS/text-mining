Lead goal of Froschungsprojektes is to explore the neural basis of efficient processing of complex acoustic signals in humans. The efficiency of these processes for example decide effective language processing or the enjoyment of music. She may suffer but neurodegenerative aging with developmental disorders in childhood or even in healthy ageing massively in the case. Acoustic signals are inherently time-structured lay summary complexes. This structure property is used by our perception to segment voice or to detect a voice in a tangle of other voices. Despite the enormous significance of temporal structuring, their perception and the implicit sensory expectations derived from it, we know little about how they physiologically represented and processed. Our research program investigated the neural basis of temporal structure processing and tests in particular the interaction of cortical and sub cortical brain structures in these complex processes. In the long term, we hope that our research specific perception tests to grow up, which capture the function of this cortico subcortical neuronal networks and already in the pre-clinical stage to neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) reveal.
