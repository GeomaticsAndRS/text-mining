Lead currently, the processage of information is based on the laws of classical physics. However, more fundamentally, the Nature is described by quantum physics. The question thus arises whether if the laws of physics quantum authorized a processage of information more effective than classical laws. Theoretically the answer is Yes, and efforts are underway to achieve a quantum computer in the lab. Lay summary the objective of this research project is threefold. First, we want to better understand the nonlinear interaction between matter and light. In the classical physics nonlinear interaction, can lead to chaos; a phenomenon characterized by an extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. However, for an isolated system, that is decoupled from its environment, the chaos is removed in the quanique regime. The mechanisms of suppression of chaos are only partially understood. Superconducting circuits represent an ideal system to study in this context, because non-linearity and coupling to the environment, can be very well controlled. On the side of the application, we propose to study the implementation of an operation of quantum logic necessary for the implementation of quantum algorithms. The idea here is to use the quantum to manipulate a bit excited States are State in a more robust way to noise. Finally, we study the properties of magnetic molecules such as Fe_8 or Mn_12 quantum coherence coupled with microwaves. Recent advances in chemistry to create magnetic molecules with specific properties. This flexibility could prove to be useful for the processage of information and we propose to study theoretical models to describe these systems.
