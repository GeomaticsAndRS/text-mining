Lead the volcanic islands in tropical climate reflect the interactions between climate and volcanic processes via their respective contributions to l? evolution of landscapes and processes d? erosion. The volcanic islands are small size environments, with a well studied volcanic history and a stable tropical climate. Lay summary the spatio-temporal variability of rates? erosion, as well as l? long term evolution of these islands, remain little known because the geochronological methods used in the mountain ranges remain difficult to apply in volcanic areas. This project aims to d? answers regarding Dynamics d? erosion operating in these islands, in order to better understand the different climate and volcanic contributions in l? topographic evolution. Recent methodological advances in geochronology of surface (i.e. luminescence and cosmogenic nuclides) open new perspectives in volcanic environment. The project s? based on these methods, supplemented by morphometric analyses and numerical modeling, and target two islands d? a volcanic tropical climate environment: La RÃ©union (Indian Ocean) and La Guadeloupe (the Caribbean Sea). It comes following two major tasks: (1) quantify the rate d? erosion and l? evolution of topography; and (2) explore the interactions between volcanism and tropical climate in l? long-term geomorphological evolution of these islands. These results complement the data d? erosion short term and eroded volumes obtained by reconstruction of volcanic edifices. Moreover, a better understanding of the response of landscapes respectively to climate and volcanic forcings is important to better understand the natural risk management. Finally, these islands are major players in cycles d? altered global and regulation of atmospheric CO 2.
