Lead Lay summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disease with high mortality rates (8th leading cause of death in US statistics 2010). The pathophysiology of CKD progression is not well understood and therefore we lack targeted treatments. The kidney is made of different cell types.  In this project, we focus on the role of kidney tubular cells in CKD progression since these cells are both actors and targets of the process. We will study here two major factors of CKD progression: the REDOX equilibrium and proteinuria. We propose new markers and future therapeutic targets for CKD progression. The main hypotheses of these project are:- 1) NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a protein producing reactive oxygen species in kidney tubular cells  is protective against cellular apoptosis and kidney fibrosis progression since it regulates antioxidant and prosurvival pathways;- 2) Proteinuria has a direct toxic effect on tubular cells of the distal nephron that may be predictive of CKD progression . Using  a combination of cellular, animal and human studies, we will assess the role of tubular cells in CKD progression. We will delineate whether NOX4 in renal tubular cells and albumin receptors in the CD that may represent potential therapeutic targets to halt CKD progression. We also propose new markers to identify patients at high risk of CKD progression.
