Lead daily weather in the mid-latitudes is dominated by the sequence of high and low pressure areas (so-called weather systems). The nature of the weather in a region is similar but often for weeks and characterized by a so-called weather regime. Contrary to the prediction of daily weather, prediction of the life cycle of a weather regime is often associated with large uncertainties. Summary content and aim of the research project this project evaluated the meteorological processes lay, affecting the life cycle of weather regimes important for Switzerland and Europe and try to find weak points in current weather forecast models. The focus is on critical stages of the life cycle, such as inserting and end a weather regime or change from one regime to another. In particular, the role of the interaction with individual weather systems is considered during this critical phase. Therefore, weather is investigated in the northern hemisphere during the past 30 years with a so-called re-analysis data set. More precisely, first systematic relationships of the occurrence of various weather systems of during critical stages of the life cycle of weather regimes are determined. This makes it possible to examine the underlying physical and dynamic processes and to uncover the other potential sources of error in the presentation of weather regimes in numerical models. Scientific and social context of the research project the project will make an important contribution to the Meteorological Research and forms the basis for a future improvement of numerical weather prediction models. Newly created diagnostic techniques can be included in the operational weather forecasting.
