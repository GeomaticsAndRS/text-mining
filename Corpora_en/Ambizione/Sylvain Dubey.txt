Lead development of the polymorphism of colour at the Viper aspic Lay summary understanding the genetic bases and environmental parameters that determine the phenotypic variation within d? a species is an important aspect of evolutionary biology. For example, the staining of organisms can be determined by various types of pigments, with melanin contributing largely to variations of colors commonly seen in vertebrates. Melanin is synthesized directly in organisms and is genetically regulated. Interestingly, the synthesis of melanin can also be influenced by environmental factors, which means that interactions between genotype d? an individual and l? environment which l? surrounds can affect melanogenesis. These routes are well known vertebrates with a significant number of key genes identified. However, most of these information result d? studies based on humans, domestic animals, and mutants of laboratory. Thus, studies on wild organisms are rare, with very little published data on the ectothermic tetrapods. In this project, I am trying to identify the genes polymorphism of colour at the aspic, through d Viper? analyses Transcriptomic, thus qu? test l? effect of different environmental conditions interacting with the color of the individuals on the expression of genes. Obviously, the Transcriptomic study proposed in this project will bring new perspectives on gene regulation d? individuals of different colors and how changes in the environment can affect the expression of genes (whether or not involved in melanogenesis).
