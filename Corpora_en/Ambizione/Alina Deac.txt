Lead Lay summary We propose a one-of-a-kind fundamental study of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the interplay between spin-polarized currents and magnetization, leading to both magnetoresistance effects and spin-transfer torques. The transfer of angular momentum from conduction electrons to the magnetization (known as spin-transfer ) allows for a controlled manipulation of the magnetization via the injected currents. Furthermore, it exhibits advantageous scaling behaviour compared to conventional field-induced magnetization switching, thus paving the way for novel devices and applications. Here, we propose a quantitative analysis of spin-dependent transport and spin-transfer torques in specially designed superlattice nanostructures with tailored perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We believe that a combination of low and high frequency magnetotransport measurements to characterize magnetoresistance, current-induced switching and spin-transfer driven precession, correlated with numerical modelling based on the extended Valet - Fert giant magnetoresistance theory and spin-transfer induced magnetization dynamics analytical calculations, will enable us to quantitatively and simultaneously determine parameters such as the damping constant, the spin-torque/ magnetoresistance angle asymmetry coefficient, the current spin polarization and possibly the interfacial spin scattering asymmetry for the considered multilayers. Our results will then provide the necessary input to motivate further work on the basic aspects of spin-transfer - such as ab-initio calculations for the asymmetry parameter, which governs the dynamic states excited by the current and thus the output power of spin-transfer oscillators, for given geometries. The work will be extended to inhomogeneous magnetization configurations - specifically, current driven domain wall motion. We expect that the comparison between the behaviour of multilayer structures with currents flowing in the plane (and perpendicular to the plane in more sophisticated designs) and the effects occurring in single-layer elements will clarify experimental results unexplained to-date - such as the factor of 10 difference in the domain wall motion speed in the two types of nanowires. The results will then be used to optimize the materials and geometries for applications, such as memory and in particular microwave oscillators, in order to develop industrially competitive spin-transfer devices.
