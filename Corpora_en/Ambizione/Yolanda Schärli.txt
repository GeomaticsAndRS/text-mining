Gene regulatory networks what electronic circuits for computer: are lead to cells, a component that meets a defined task. This project seeks to understand how well gene regulatory networks can get their function (i.e. they are as robust), when their building instructions randomly changes (mutations). I'm also investigating how these gene regulatory networks change during the evolution. Summary gene-regulatory networks process signals, the cells constantly get lay. An important example is during development of multicellular organisms, these networks are responsible to define the blueprint of the body. Amazingly, similar plans can be achieved with very different gene regulatory networks. In this project, I will investigate whether they differ in their robustness against mutations the different networks and how they change during the evolution. These are important questions of modern biological research, but the corresponding experiments with whole organisms are very complex and so many questions are open. In this project, I will use a new approach to these questions to selected: using synthetic biology. In other words, I'm investigating the properties and evolution of gene regulatory networks (in the laboratory) of people in bacteria? built? were. To do this, I will use a combination of laboratory experiments and computational models. Thanks to this new approach, the project to provide important insights into the properties and evolution of natural gene regulatory networks promises.
