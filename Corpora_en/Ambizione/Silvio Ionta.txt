Lead research project title clinical benefits of validation of a model of much current Integration (Validation of a Model of Sensorimotor Integration with Clinical Benefits) Lay summary In summary A proper integration much?-the ability to organize sensory perceptions and motor acts-is critical to effectively interact with the environment. However, the reciprocal role sensory and motor processes is not yet clear. The study of these two sources of information can be done with the mental imagination, a cognitive task that activates motor representations without sensory stimulation. This approach is particularly important to understand sensory abnormalities and physical impairments for which there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic protocols. However, before implementing new strategies for treatment, you must: 1) validate a theoretical model of much current integration, 2) deepen the knowledge about physiopathological sensorimotori processes; 3) understand the neural mechanisms of changes induced by rehabilitation subject and aim to obtain measures of brain activity for sensorimotori processes, the project aims to make behavioral testing, of neurophysiological and imaging technology. Furthermore, in order to improve therapeutic interventions, the project will study the behavioral and neural effects of non-invasive treatments aimed at cortical reorganization socio-scientific Context the project will identify pathological changes in brain activity associated with sensorimotorie syndromes and provide information about the Organization and interaction of different brain networks, with a strong impact on the quality of life of patients. In fact the extension of knowledge much integration mechanisms and the results obtained in clinical populations will provide enough information to identify effective rehabilitation protocols that will open a new scenario for the development of non-invasive treatment for other syndromes sensorimotorie Extensible key words, Sensory motor rehabilitation, imaging technology, the brain
