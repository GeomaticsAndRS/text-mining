The exploratory in the dark lead: A possible light for major depression Lay summary the exploratory behaviour is fundamental to all mammals. It is essential for all learning. In several mental illnesses, this behavior is achieved, altered and amended. Patients who suffer from major depression, the Group of mental illness more common in the world, displayed a deficit marked exploration induced by the novelty. The etiology of these changes remains obscure. There are, however, substantial evidence that the function of the hippocampus is impaired in major depression. My work and those of other researchers have clearly shown that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in exploration induced by the novelty in rodents than in humans. Therefore, we propose to examines the circuits which innervate the hippocampus which may govern the motivation for exploration. In doing so, we want to shed light, not only on the basic mechanisms of the brain that lead to exploratory behaviour, but also on the etiology of the deficits of the exploratory behavior observed in major depression.
