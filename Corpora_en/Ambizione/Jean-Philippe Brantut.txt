Lead in recent years, cooling techniques allowed the realization of gas of atoms at very low temperatures, forming a fluid analogous to electrons in solid materials. This analogy allows d? use these gases to model complex materials. While the issue of control of the materials is their use in complex and miniaturized components, the idea of model components with cold atoms has appeared only recently. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work our project consists in modelling of miniaturized electronic components to the aid of cold atoms trapped by lasers. L? study of these electronic components at scales Nano is the field of mesoscopic physics. We will achieve Atomic, similar to solid electronics components and reproduce their functioning in a very controlled environment. We will then use the levers of specific controls of cold atoms to make new components, and explore inaccessible configurations with current electronics technologies. Scientific and social context of the project our work to open a search field in l? interface between l? miniaturized electronics and atomic physics. Modelling cold atoms of phenomena encountered in the electronic components will serve as validation for the theory and numerical simulations. It may also act as bench d? test for future technological developments in microelectronics. Â  Key words Mesoscopic physics ultracold atoms, quantum transport, quantum phase transitions
