Lead Lay summary This project takes place in the context of fingermark detection by the use of nanoparticles. A fingermark is defined as the secretion residue that is left by a person when a surface is touched with unprotected hands. This is an essential trace allowing the identification of the author of the contact, foremost in criminal investigation. Despite the numerous conventional techniques available to forensic investigators, there is still a strong need for new and more efficient methods to detect such marks. The use of functionalized and luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) constitutes an answer to this willingness of being a step forward compared to the existing techniques. The choice for NPs (metallic, inorganic or silica-based) has been made because they are currently widely and successfully used in other fields (from electronics to biology). Up to now, very limited researches on functionalized NPs were performed by other forensic laboratories. NPs offer several advantages that suit perfectly the detection of fingermarks: (1) their nano-size is fully adapted to target molecular elements and to obtain well-resolved images of the finger ridge patterns, (2) they can be chemically modified so that they offer new functionalities, and (3) they possess strong luminescence capabilities. By subtly tuning such particles, it should be possible to obtain a full range of molecules designed to target specific components of the finger residue and effective on a wide range of surfaces (printed paper, banknotes, plastic, polystyrene, etc.). The aim of this project is to propose powerful alternatives (more specific and sensitive) to existing reagents or procedures which are, most of the time, limited in their range of application. Moreover, the development of commercial kits, that can be used on crime scenes or in the laboratory, would be appreciated by specialists working in the field. It can be a way to valorise intellectual property rights.
