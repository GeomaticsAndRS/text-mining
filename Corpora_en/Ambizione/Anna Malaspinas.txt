Lead Lay summary BACKGROUND: The field of ancient DNA has recently entered the genomics era, with several whole nuclear genomes available. It is now possible to address fundamental evolutionary questions utilizing the temporal aspect of this new data, such as the amount of selection acting on the genome. However, methods to analyze ancient DNA are lacking owing to the previous rarity of this data type. AIMS: The main goals of my proposal are to 1) develop methods tailored to the characteristics of ancient DNA, in particular the time serial aspect 2) apply those methods to answer biological relevant such as the adaptation to high altitude in the Andes. The goal is to identify regions in the genome that are under selection for high altitude adaptation. METHODOLOGY: Methods: We will build on existing methods based on diffusion approximation to classical population genetics models. Extensions will include application of the one locus theory to whole genome data taking a likelihood approach, and usage of the linkage information. Data:Â  We will sequence exomes for 15 mummy samples from the Andes in order to characterize the strength and timing of selective events associated with adaptation to high altitude on the Altiplano. We expect to learn more about unique processes such as how and when humans adapted to high altitude. POTENTIAL RESULTS:
