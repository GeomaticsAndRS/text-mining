Lead focuses on this project with the combined analysis of data from the fields of genetics and diagnostic radiology of renal cell carcinoma, to gain new insights with regard to the identification of genetic changes of renal cell carcinoma by means of radiological images and to improve the prediction of the course of the disease. Lay summary objectives: this project has been designed in several stages over a period of at least three years with the following global objectives: (1) identification of the genotype of renal cell carcinoma by CT and MRI images, as well as the analysis of the reproducibility of this process. (2) integrated radio genomic Diagnostics for active follow-up of renal cell carcinoma. Here, the prognostic significance of each morphological and functional characteristics of renal cell carcinoma by CT and MRI are first investigated images. In addition, an increased emphasis is placed on the identification and quantification of necrosis. Last collected data are placed then in a statistical model, which is used to reliably predict the survival of patients, as well as? mainly older - patients with renal cell carcinoma reliably during the control.           Scientific and social context: the combination of genetic and radiological diagnostic data to help improve the selection of patients with renal cell carcinoma to the operation and those patients who can not be operated, reliable imaging are controlled by.
