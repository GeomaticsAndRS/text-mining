Lead the aim of this research project is the manufacture and testing of nano Graphene systems? in which electrons serve as quantum bits? for spin-based information processing. Lay summary systems by delkokalisierten stable radicals, such as triangular fragments of Graphenen or offenschaligen Nanographenen, are promising molecular building blocks for the design of electronic components, which stores information about unpaired electrons. Phenalenyl (C13H9) is the smallest offenschalige graph fragment. It consists of three connected Benzenoid rings which three carbon?Share carbon bonds. As a result, that the structure of Phenalenyl in the neutral State has an odd number of electrons. Precisely because of this odd number of Eletkronen an electron can not participate in the double binding network and therefore potentially serve as quantum information carriers. The first efforts of the proposed research are offenschalige Nanographene which are larger than Phenalenyl to isolate and characterize. This should be the first time the Multiplet allow ground state to explore nature of this species in the solid state. The strive for contributing molecular spin components, focus the tasks of the proposed research (1) synthetic methods for the production of precision, to develop monodisperse and stable offenschaligen Nanographenen and explore (2) the high spin ground state of these compounds in solution and in the solid state and characterize. In would also gain in my research plan (3) fundamental knowledge of multi-radical reactions and investigate (4) intra - and Intermolecular synergies of the synthesized offenschaligen species in solution and in the solid state. Finally (5) the electronic and magnetic properties of individual molecules and their ensembles can be examined so that (6) molecule-based electronic components are constructed.
