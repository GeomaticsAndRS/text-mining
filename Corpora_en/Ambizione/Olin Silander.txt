Lead Lay summary Organisms adapt to their environment through changing their phenotype. Although this frequently involves small, quantitative changes, in rare instances, qualitative changes can occur, giving rise to completely novel phenotypes and functions. In previous work, we used experimental evolution in the laboratory to understand how frequently novel phenotypes and functions can arise in bacteria. We found that novel functionality can arise often, as a result of only a small number of genetic changes, and over very short time scales (tens of generations). The experiments that we propose here aim at extending this work in two ways. First, we will characterize the functional effects of the genetic changes that we observed during laboratory evolution: how do these genetic changes affect the amount of protein in the cell, and how do they affect protein function? Second, we will move our focus from the lab to the natural world: we will try to understand how often different phenotypes arise in natural populations of bacteria using different strains of Escherichia coli (which can be both a human pathogen and a human commensal). We will use a combination of new technologies, including genomic sequencing, microfluidics, and high-throughput phenotypic assays to understand the genetic changes that underlie behavioral differences between these strains (e.g. in responding to stress or in reacting to the presence of different sugars). Secondly, we will quantify the time frame over which these behavior and phenotypic changes occur, and test whether this varies for different behaviors or phenotypes.
