Lead In the field of metal conservation, the preservation of archaeological iron artefacts encounters severe problems after excavation when different salts containing chloride ions contaminate the corrosion crust surrounding the object. As a result of electrochemical processes, chemical reactions with pollutants and physical phenomenon of deposit accumulation, irreversible changes in the original appearance and structure can be observed on the objects. Lay summary Content and research work objectives Here is proposed MAIA (Microbes for Archaeological Iron Artworks), an innovative alternative treatment where the stabilization after excavation of archaeological iron artefacts can be provided by naturally occurring microorganisms. In this project, i) a synergetic microbial consortium will be specially designed for the formation of stable iron compounds, such as iron oxalates or magnetite, and the simultaneously removal of chloride ions that are the instigators of corrosion after excavation; ii) The newly formed iron compounds (oxalates and magnetite) will be carefully investigated over iron solid phases and their properties defined in order to optimize the application procedure. A careful assessment of the methodology will be carried out before iii) real samples are integrated in order to validate the new conservation method elaborated. Scientific and social context of the research project A significant contribution will be given to the iron conservation issue. A study under a completely new point of view will be established exploiting some specific capacities of microbes: a real progress is expected in terms of durability, effectiveness and toxicity. Dealing with chemistry of microorganisms, this project will open new trends in the development of methods and materials for conservation. In the future, the novel treatment could be exploited as an easy-to-use application kit, which could be directly employed by conservator-restorers or during archaeological excavations.
