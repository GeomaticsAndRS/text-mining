It was not only the State support for mothers and parents (maternity insurance) expanded but also solid in external family child care (cr√®ches and? heard) invested. Lay summary content and the aim of the research project specifically to examine the thesis in this project, whether politicians strategically choose reforms in family policy to win votes. This can be done when the topic is important for citizens and their Government rewarded them therefore to have operated an expansionary policy in this policy field. The project applies a quantitative comparative approach, based on concrete reforms to examine whether and to what extent parties could claim votes after they have built day nursery places or financial support for parents. Further steps affiliated more closely examined whether the population really favour a greater State exposure and on the basis of a specific case (Germany 2006) resolved, whether those citizens who already benefit from the more generous State benefits, are really satisfied with the Government. Scientific and social context this project will contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics in this particular area of social policy and in General helps us to understand the role of citizen opinions in the decisions of politicians. This is socially relevant, as is the reconciliation of family and working life for many citizens of increasing importance.
