Lead Lay summary Infections in humans and animals are often colonized by dense bacterial communities called biofilms , in which individual bacteria secrete substances that allow them to adhere to each other and to external surfaces and help protect them against antibiotic treatments. Because the production of these substances is beneficial to all members of the biofilm, it is considered to be cooperative. However, evolutionary theory predicts that cooperation is only likely if biofilms are spatially structured such that cells from the same lineages are more likely to interact with one another. The aim of the project is to understand the factors that cause bacteria from different lineages to mix within a biofilm, and how such changes in spatial structure will affect the maintenance of cooperative behavior and thus, on the maintenance of the biofilm itself. To achieve this goal, we will combine social evolutionary theory with microbiology and molecular genetics. We expect that this work will lead to a greater understanding of social behavior in bacteria and its evolution, which may lead to novel methods for controlling bacterial infections.
