Lead Internet-based treatment of various anxiety disorders lay summary Internet-based psychotherapeutic interventions will be explored for over a decade. Over 100 different disorder images controlled studies found significant and meaningful superiority of online mediated interventions compared to waitlist controls very consistently. Web-based interventions in various anxiety disorders have proved to be particularly effective. The examined Internet-based programs were so far mostly disorder specific meaning E.g. in the Internet-based social phobia treatment, to ignore such as co-morbidity panic disorder in the course of high standardised intervention. In this project, an initial intervention was evaluated, Internet addresses the problem of co-morbidity in different anxiety disorders in a new way and making use of advantages of the medium. Patients who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, a social phobia, panic disorder or agoraphobia, or a generalized anxiety disorder, were given simultaneous access to specific disorder self-help modules for various anxiety disorders. In a randomized study, this new approach was compared with a disorder-specific intervention and with a control group. The results show that both conditions when compared to the control group are effective, that the two conditions but do not differ. Based on these results disorder-specific as well as interventions for multiple anxiety disorders can be considered promising for the treatment of anxiety disorders.Â  Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in the population along with emotional and substance use disorders, considered deficient and cause high economic costs as well as subjectively high disease pressure. Low-threshold and cost-effective therapies that can be easily distributed and flexibly used as Internet-based approaches therefore represent an important complement to traditional therapy offerings.
