Lead the function d? a biomolecule in an organism is defined by its 3-dimensional structure. Unfortunately, no existing method used to determine the structure d? a single biomolecule. In order to design new drugs based on knowledge of the structure of biomolecules, it is essential to develop a method which allows to visualize a single biomolecule with atomic resolution. c? is the ultimate goal of this project. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work our main objective is to develop a new kind of electron microscopy based on diffraction d? slow electrons for the determination of 3-dimensional structure of biomolecules. To do this a parallel beam d? slow electrons is formed by a lens of micrometer size and headed in the direction of biomolecules previously placed on a suspended graphene layer. Graphene is a d layer? of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern and d? a thickness d? an atom only, two properties which are the ideal substrate for microscopy Graphene to slow electrons. The first objective of this project and find a method to put biological molecules on ultra-clean suspended graphene layers. Three methods are being considered: freeze-drying, deposition assisted by AFM and l? electro-nebulisation. As soon as the most appropriate method has been identified, the first slow electron diffraction experiments will be conducted to determine the structure d? a single biomolecule with atomic resolution. Scientific and social context of the research project our work will generate new and essential information about the structure of biomolecules. This will allow better understanding of diseases related to malfunction of biomolecules and the design of new and more effective drugs.Â
