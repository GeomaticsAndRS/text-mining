Lead communication of emotions to regulate social interactions. Indicators d? emotion in the human voice have made l? subject of numerous studies. In contrast, most d? studies are needed so d? identify the link between the emotions experienced by the animals, and the characteristics of their vocalizations. Lay summary contents and objectives of research in a first time, I'll review the indicators d? emotion in mammals. In a second time, I'll study? effect of domestication on our ability to identify indicators voice d? emotion in animals, and vice versa (the ability of the animals to perceive emotions in the human voice). For this purpose, I will compare this ability in three domestic species (horses, goats and pigs) and three wild species that their are relatives (Przewalski's horses, ibex and wild boar). The capacity of human-animal vocal communication of emotions can be s? explain in several ways. First, indicators d? emotions might have been preserved in l? evolution, and therefore to be very similar between humans and animals. Secondly, humans and animals could have acquired this ability during domestication, in which case the communication of emotions should be more effective between humans and pets than wild. Finally, this capability could s? acquire with l? experience, which presupposes that those who are in contact with domestic animals would be better than others in l? identification of the emotions of these species. Scientific and social context of the research project my results will lead to a better understanding of l? indicators d? emotion. In addition, my project will know l? effect of domestication on the human-animal communication.
