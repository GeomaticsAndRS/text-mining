Lead this project aims to analyse exhaustively the celestial and Astral ratings that are located in the three major epic poems of the time Flavian (the Thebaid of Statius, the Argonautica of Valerius Flaccus, the Punica of Silius Italicus), in order to understand what was the infuence of one of the most famous texts of classical antiquity, the phenomena of Aratus of soli. Lay summary contents and objectives of research from the literary point of view, the main purpose is to grasp the importance of the arateenne tradition and the use made of the poetry epic Flavian. Is is-t-it simply Mannerism from other sources, or can we speak of originality? What significant aspect of the arateenne tradition has survived and why? The intertextual comparison will have a better knowledge of these texts and their arrangements, and it will be useful to illuminate passages remained obscure and still debated issues such as dating.   Exegetical perspective, the aim is especially to capture all imperial propaganda elements related to the astral context to verify if poets use only in favour of the plan, or if they are also (in allusive way) to criticize power. This study would provide therefore a complete vision for caelum Flavium and dimension policy; It could also provide solutions to problems of historical, cultural and artistic related at the time Flavian.   Finally, as the Astral tradition is deeply linked to philosophical concepts (including stoic), the proposed study would also favour a deepening of this aspect, which is far d? be negligible overall of poetry epic Flavian.   Keywords Greek and Latin literature, astronomy, astrology, epic poetry, catasterism, technopaignia, acrostics, Aratus, Statius, Silius Italicus, Valerius Flaccus, Flavian culture
