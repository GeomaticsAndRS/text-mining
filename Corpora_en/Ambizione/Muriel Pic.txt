Lead this project is devoted to l? scientific edition of the unpublished archives of romande Swiss poet Edith Boissonnas (1904-1989). Author by éditions Gallimard, this work allows d? unsung aspects of the whole cultural relations during l? inter-war period, the war and the years? post-war. Lay summary the scientific edition of the unpublished archives of Édith Boissonnas provides a precious testimony on two fundamental aspects of the literary history of the 20th century: d? one hand, identity fantasies animating the French cultural relations; and, d? on the other hand, the development of feminism in these two countries. The specificity of this testimony is s? operate in reference to an ethnographic mind which apprehends all reality, even the most familiar, as foreign, unknown. The? work of Boissonnas shows how, in their reference to science new qu? is ethnography, literature and the arts of the time rekindled with a moralistic discourse that makes the primitive look a critical tool on contemporary society. The subject acquires knowledge that by questioning the authority of its cognitive achievement. This project therefore proposes to show in what framework epistemological s? operates at Boissonnas, an analysis of identity criteria of gender and nationality; but also, what are the effects of a socio-cultural repositioning of the subject, on the basis of the category of the primitive, on the two main literary registers summoned by Boissonnas: the lyric poetry and l? autobiography.
