Lead subduction zones generate Vulkansimus because fluids from the subducting plate in the overlying mantle wedge warming rise, where they melt them. Some volcanic rocks (Adakite) are often differently interpreted: represent the melting of subducting plate and not that of the mantle wedge. But recent findings suggests that all subducting plates are hot enough to melt. Therefore, a new explanation for the Adakitgenese is necessary. Lay summary content and aim of the research project this project which searches for alternative explanations for the differences?Adakite? in comparison to? normal? Subduction zones exist. These three different hypotheses should be examined experimentally, which could explain the main geochemical differences: (a) thermal and (b) redox differences in the mantle wedge, as well as (c) kinetic factors (E.g. different transport mechanisms). The results will have important consequences, for example for thermal models, because they set the petrological framework conditions for temperature regime. Furthermore, the research results will have impact on further work that will try to decipher the geochemical signal from this particular subduction volcanoes in detail. Scientific and social context of the research project as are often economically valuable copper and gold deposits in the vicinity of Adakiten, is that we understand in detail how Adakite are formed and which geological conditions you must ensure that the exploration of great importance to the search for new raw material reservoirs.
