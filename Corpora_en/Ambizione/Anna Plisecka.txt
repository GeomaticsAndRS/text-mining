Lead lay summary the project examined the enforcement of Roman imperial law in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries of ad. The published Greek translations of the Imperial constitutions are subject to analysis. Purpose and effects this normative communication of Roman Emperor should are explored with the Greek-speaking inhabitants of the province. In my work, I would like to try to answer three basic questions: the first concerns the organisation of the translation and dissemination of Imperial legislation in the provinces, while the second examines how bilingualism and language contact affect legal terminology and legal concepts. The third area is devoted to the consequences of multilingualism for the application of Roman law in the provinces, especially in the public law and litigation. The linguistic form is important for the law, because it represents an instrument of Rechtskommunikation for lawyers and State authorities. As a consequence that the lawyers and legislators in multilingual societies operate, meet them difficulties not only for the communication of legal standards, but also in their interpretation and application. Problems of this kind currently pose a challenge for lawyers, legislators and courts in the Member States of the European Union and covered by a lively academic debate in the the relationship between the different language versions at the same time as well as in the Constitution as well as in the interpretation, translation of legal terms and the requirements of the normative communication are discussed. These problems are not foreign even the Swiss judges and lawmakers. In my opinion you can make a contribution to this debate if it brings the arguments arising from the Roman experience. The results of research can contribute to the discussion on the legal translation new arguments.Â
