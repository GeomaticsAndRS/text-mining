Lead the impact of stellar winds on exoplanets Lay summary for a long time, the man was intrigued by the existence of planets similar to the note. Are there inhabitable planets? And that is what makes that some worlds would then be habitable than others sterile? The presence of liquid water is probably necessary for livability, but not a sufficient condition. In my project Ambizione, I understand how interactions between exoplanets and stellar wind from their host star affect their livability throughout the life of the system. Such interactions can evaporate the atmosphere of the planet, will rid as well an important factor of the creation and the development of life. These interactions can also lead a observable signatures, as for example the extrasolar planet radio show, and the strengthening of stellar activity, providing an invaluable overview of the system.  However, our understanding of the impact of stellar winds on extrasolar planets is still very limited - everything we know on the subject emerges from the interactions in our solar system. Although about astronomical is actually very util for the understanding of other planetary systems, the different stars produce different winds. Indeed, exoplanetary systems resemble little, and often even not, our own solar system, that suggests that exoplanets are very different from ours. In my project Ambizione, I determine how extrasolar planet might be habitable by studying their interaction with the wind magnetized from their star host during the evolution of the system. In order to achieve my goal, I'll use numerical models of stellar evolution and stellar wind. This will allow me to study the effect of the stellar wind on the rotation of the star over time.As a result, a change in the rotation of the star will affect its magnetic field and its activity, which will eventually change the stellar wind and the chances that the planet is habitable.
