Lead Lay summary Lead: Early diagnosis of cancer diseases and efficient therapy approaches are key components of modern medicine. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of methods allowing non-invasive tumor diagnosis and therapy. Targeting the folate receptor (FR) with folate radioconjugates is a promising strategy to achieve this goal. Background: The FR is overexpressed in a variety of tumor types (e.g. ovarian, endometrial, lung, colon carcinomas) but highly restricted in normal tissues and organs with the only exception of the kidneys. Therefore, folic acid can be used for selective delivery of diagnostic or therapeutic probes to cancer cells. Folate-based radioconjugates for imaging purposes have been successfully applied in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, we developed a novel folic acid derivative with improved pharmacokinetics which allows for the first time also a therapeutic application using particle-emitting radioisotopes.   Goal: The goal of this project is to perform preclinical therapy studies using folate conjugates labeled with therapeutic radioisotopes. The effects of several radioisotopes with different decay properties, variable dosage and application protocols will be tested and compared. The antitumor effect of radiofolates will also be investigated in combination with chemotherapeutics (e.g. pemetrexed). Regarding a potential damage to the kidneys, the application of renoprotective agents such as e.g. amifostine will be assessed with the aim to improve the toxicity profile of this therapy approach.    Expected Value: Over 50% of frequently occurring cancer types overexpress the FR which indicates the high relevance of this tumor target. Application of folic acid targeted radiopharmaceuticals to treat FR-positive cancer diseases is therefore of paramount interest. The development of an effective treatment protocol can help to face the rapidly growing problem of cancer in the western population.
