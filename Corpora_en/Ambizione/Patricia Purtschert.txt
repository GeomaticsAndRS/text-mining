Lead the aim of the present project is to stimulate the knowledge transfer of postcolonial theory in the Switzerland and to apply a postcolonial perspective on the Switzerland. Although no official colonial power, the Switzerland was involved in colonial epistemic systems, representation and knowledge systems. The common position that the Switzerland with colonialism had nothing to do, may be critically so from a cultural studies perspective. Lay summary the research consists of three discourse-analytical part projects devoted to following topics: Swiss children's literature and drama, Swiss mountain boarding expeditions in the Himalayas and the reporting to the independence of Ghana. The documents underlying investigations, all have an explicit reference to the Switzerland and produced between 1930-1960. In each part of the project, a selection of font and image documents is taken and on colonial representation procedure and examined through discourse-analytical and deconstructive readings. It is wondered how the genesis of Swiss and European notions of identity with the representation of cultural others associated. A significant focus also on intersectionality, and thus the question, how colonial differences with gender, sexual -, nationality, religion or other differences are clasped. (Therefore are subject) the one bondage of Switzerland in Euro-centric, colonial orders of knowledge and b) specifically Swiss versions and adaptations of such thought patterns in scientific and popular contexts.
