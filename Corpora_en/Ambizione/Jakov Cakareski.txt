Lead Lay summary The project will investigate intelligent multimedia systems that will address the new engineering and scientific challenges that are introduced by the fusion of community sites, content production tools, the proliferation of multi-camera arrays, and the advent of virtual worlds. Our systems will account for the plethora of contextual information generated in such scenarios to efficiently and reliably deliver immersive multimedia communication to all corners of the worlds. Important applications spanning telecollaboration and telecommuting, environmental monitoring and disaster relief, as well as telemedicine and health care, will all benefit from the advances in networked multimedia that the project will enable. In conjunction, we will study novel techniques for efficient quality-of-experience aware signal processing and communication of decentralized information sources in loose coalitions of networked devices, as frequently encountered in social networking settings and wireless mesh networks, in general. Our distributed protocols will take advantage of the inherent robustness and bandwidth scalability of such environments and will exploit concepts from reinforcement learning, Pareto optimality, and network coding to comprehensively advance the state-of-the-art. They will incorporate energy-aware aspects for further power efficiency and energy conservation.
