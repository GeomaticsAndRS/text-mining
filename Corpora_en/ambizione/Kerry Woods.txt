Lead we be interactions between the major pathogen examine Theileria and its host cell and use his fascinating cell biology, to gain new insights into cellular processes relating to cancer. Devastating diseases of cattle, which are common in Africa, Asia and the Mediterranean region cause lay summary Theileria-Parasiten. Different immune cells, which develop cancer-like properties due to the parasites infect you. These cells multiply quickly become resistant to cell death, and acquire a metastatic phenotype. A fascinating feature of this Theileria-induzierten transformation is that it is reversible by killing the parasite, an important model for cancer research is what infected cells. The infection with Theileria activate different kinases of the host cell with important roles in signal transduction and regulation of cellular processes. The underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Several molecules of the host cell, including some kinases and microtubule-associated proteins are recruited to the surface of the parasite. We will explore the interactions of these proteins with the parasites with the hypothesis that the parasite surface as a platform for signal transmission works. Using biochemical and cell biological methods will be identified the parasite surface protein interaction networks, and examined their functional relevance concerning transformation. This work will provide insights on the interactions of these important pathogens with the host cell. It has the potential to uncover new mechanisms of transformation, which could be transferred in the field of human cancer. Â
