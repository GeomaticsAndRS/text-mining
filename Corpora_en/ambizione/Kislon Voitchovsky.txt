Lead Lay summary In this project, Amplitude-Modulation Atomic Force Microscopy (AM-AFM) is used to locally investigate complex solid-liquid interface (SLI) with sub-nanometer lateral resolution. To date, most studies on the molecular structure of SLIs and on phenomena taking place at SLIs have relied on diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. Although very accurate, these techniques generally produce an average over large areas, thus treating interfaces as homogeneous within the investigated region. These measurements are particularly challenging for laterally inhomogeneous SLIs, typically where the solid surface is composed of nanoscale domains presenting different structural and chemical properties. Recent developments in the field of AFM have shown that AM-AFM, when operated under appropriate conditions, can provide quantitative information about solid-liquid interfacial energy with sub-nanometer lateral precision. The interfacial liquid is probed dynamically and locally at the surface of the investigated sample. SLIs decay rapidly ( 2nm) into the liquid, making this approach very sensitive to local variations in the interfacial liquid?s structural organization and density. Laterally, SLI variations are not only induced by changes in the surface topography of the solid but also by changes in the local solvation properties. Here this technique is applied to four important problems involving SLIs in chemistry, materials science, physics and biology. In each case, the complexity of the interface makes any investigation with other approaches particularly challenging. If successful, this project will provide fundamentally new insight into these problems and, more generally, open new possibilities for studying phenomena occurring at the SLI with molecular or atomic-level resolution.
