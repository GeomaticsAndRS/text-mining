Our opinions, intentions, expectations, and preferences must be coherent and consistent to meet lead to the standards of rationality. These must not contradict each other and must evaluate to a unit. What reasons are there but to comply with the standards of rationality? Is it always justified to be useful or coherent value and consistent? Lay summary content and aim of the research project places them before they have a firm intention to pilot. You know to become a pilot, must undergo a medical examination she. However, they have to do no intention. On the contrary. You have committed never again to visit a doctor. In this case, they are not completely rational. You violated a central norm of objective rationality of of means of. It is also the case that they are not quite so as they should be? There is always a normative justification, the norm of the target funds to satisfy rationality? This research project attempts to answer this question for some of the key standards of rationality. In particular, it will be important to show that there are epistemological reasons, to meet key standards of rationality. Reasons will play a special role, relating to normative opinions (i.e., opinions about what we should do).  Scientific and social context, rationality is a central value of the Western world. This project seeks to illuminate this status of rationality. This will show whether the value of rationality can be philosophically justified.
