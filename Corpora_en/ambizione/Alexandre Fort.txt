Lead each of the cells of the human body produces from their DNA, a multitude of molecules d? ARN. A large fraction of these RNAs n? is not translated into protein but directly involved in gene regulation mechanisms. L? study of these 'noncoding' RNA has experienced a large boom following recent advances in the understanding of the genomes and the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies. The project aims d? bring new knowledge on the genetic mechanisms involving the ARNs 'noncoding '. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research currently work, we know that the human genome is virtually fully transcribed, producing a d amount?'Noncoding' RNA as important as RNAs messengers, intermediate in the synthesis of proteins. A particular d category?'Noncoding' RNA was discovered in 2010 and remains little studied; they are the RNAs produced by the regulatory regions of the genome (enhancer RNAs = eRNAs). The first phase of the project aims d? identify and quantify the eRNAs in two cohorts d? human cell samples. The data obtained in this first part will allow l? study of the genetic regulation of the eRNAs. Subsequently, the molecular mechanisms engaging eRNAs involved in the regulation of genes associated with human disease will be studied. Scientific and social context of the research project the project is part of basic research in medical genetics. To better understand l? involvement of genetics in l? etiology of human disease, it is fundamental to decrypt the genomic mechanisms regulating l? cellular activity. L? identification of new actors of these mechanisms (e.g. noncoding RNAs) may offer new therapeutic strategies or be useful in prevention of diseases markers.
