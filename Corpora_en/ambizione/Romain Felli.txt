Lead the idea of resilience is an important broadcast a decade year, particularly within international organizations, as a way of thinking about adaptation to environmental change. In this research we understand the origins, content, and the reasons for the success of this idea. Lay summary of the research project aims to analyze a political language relatively new, one of the? resilience? This language is experiencing a growing broadcast a decade d? years, notably within international organizations. It is particularly used in the d? a transformation of international environmental policies that are moving the conservation of l? environment and l? mitigation of environmental change in l? adaptation to environmental change. The questions of who should s? fit what and how remain vigorously debated between States, international organizations, experts, NGOs etc. Nevertheless, l? together actors involved seem to share l? idea that 'resilience '? Qu? an influential report defines as "the ability to s? adapt and succeed in a difficult situation? is a way forward for succeeding in the age of l? adaptation to environmental change. In this project, I m? interested in the manner in which l? idea of resilience has released over the past decade in the official speeches d? a selection of six international organizations. This project will address not only the substantive content of this idea, but the way she taxied to the places where it was produced, to those who are in charge of its promotion, etc. In thus dealing with the manner in which the framing of l? adaptation to environmental change is putting in place, I think I can illuminate d? a new day the transformations of international environmental policy, beyond what was named "compromise of l? liberal environmentalism. Thus, in addition to its contribution to l? empirical history of political ideas, this project will contribute to l? study of governance of l? environment.
