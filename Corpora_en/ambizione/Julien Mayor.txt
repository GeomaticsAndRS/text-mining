Lead Lay summary Children with Williams Syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, are commonly described as possessing preserved language skills but impaired cognitive abilities such as mild to moderate mental retardation and severely impaired visuo-spatial abilities. This seemingly unimpaired language capacity has often been cited as evidence for the presence of dissociated modules underlying the human language capacity and more general cognitive processes in the human brain. However, closer scrutiny reveals that language development in WS children follows an unusual developmental trajectory. The goal of this research focuses on WS children's apparent inability to generalise words to novel referents, the so-called taxonomic constraint, despite possessing a large vocabulary. I propose to investigate, from a neuro-computational perspective, potential neural mechanisms that lead to the phenotype of WS language acquisition, to account for this inability to generalise word-object associations in a normal fashion, and to demonstrate how this inability to generalise interacts with other word learning strategies. This research project has the potential to identify the kind of deficits underlying WS and generate novel empirical predictions and explanations for patterns of word usage in WS children. Furthermore, a better understanding of the nature of the impairment may lead to enhanced therapeutic treatment through, for example, manipulation of the learning environment of WS children. Finally, this project has also the potential for addressing the debate regarding the modularity of language and clarifying the interrelation between language and other cognitive aspects of development that might have important theoretical repercussions for our understanding of complex functions in the brain.
