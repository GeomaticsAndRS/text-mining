Lead numerous studies show that cardiovascular metabolic diseases are much more frequent in the most disadvantaged sectors of the population. This project will use data from various countries to investigate the biological mechanisms (eg, inflammatory, epigenetic etc) that explain the link between social hardships in life and onset of cardiovascular diseases metabolic pathways to adulthood. Lay summary and objective social inequalities in health are a ubiquitous phenomenon. However, research has yet to provide a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have suggested that the differences in lifestyles can help to explain a large proportion of social inequalities in health. In recent years, research has begun to address the issue of how socio-economic status is concretely embodied in biological terms. This research project will focus on cardio-metabolic diseases, which show a strong social gradient and whose burden in the least-favoured sectors of society is rapidly increasing worldwide. The overall objective is to extend the study of social inequality in health and their determinants, integrating the analysis of biological mechanisms linking the social hardships throughout his life and cardio-metabolic diseases. Socio-scientific multidisciplinary (social epidemiology, cardiovascular, metabolic and cardiovascular genetics, public health, sleep medicine, internal medicine, and molecular biology) that characterizes this research project has a potential to produce new and innovative responses to the question of how socioeconomic status later in life can influence health until decades later. In addition, the use of five databases from different countries and offering a wide range of phenotypes measured repeatedly over time, along with precise socioeconomic status indicators will enable replication of results and examination of potential variations between countries.
