Lead interferon lambda is an important neurotransmitter of the immune system and has potent modulating effects on the innate and acquired immune response. Relating to vaccinations such as influenza viruses, the importance of lambda was investigated so far poorly of interferon. The project makes a contribution to do so. Lay summary content and objectives of the research project, about 50% of the European population have genetic polymorphisms in genes of interferon lambda signal cascade. These polymorphisms regulating the genetic expression significantly during an infection with viruses. In the context of vaccination, for example a genetic polymorphism (rs8099917 TG or GG) to a significantly enhanced antibody leads response against influenza viruses. In experiments, we could show the virus-induced Zytokinebalance critically influenced lambda recombinant interferon and causes a reduction in so-called TH2 cytokines, moreover, an inhibition of B cells and virus-specific secretion of antibodies. Blocking substances of the interferon show in contrast, lambda signal cascade improving the antibody response. This novel excipients, so-called adjuvants that could be developed. The project has as a target in the first phase, to substances which inhibit the interferon lambda signal cascade better understand. In a second phase, the potential adjuvants in vaccines in the mouse model are tested. Scientific and social context of the key project the project deals with translationeller research on the immune system. To enhance the immune response, especially the antibody response against influenza, it is important to understand modulating factors such as interferon lambda. This research could give us help, this signal system to modulate the immunization response will be better, and patients with an immune deficiency are better protected against virus diseases. An important contribution to the development of novel adjuvants could be made. Â  18 September 2014
