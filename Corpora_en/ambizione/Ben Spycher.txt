Lead in the Switzerland develop cancer annually about 200 children. We know little about the causes of this disease and there is no way to prevent. Some possible risk factors, are reminiscent of the place of residence of children depend on, such as for example air pollution. This study looks at such risk factors with methods of spatial epidemiology. In the period from 1985 to today, compare data of all children, lived in the Switzerland with those of children who became ill with cancer. Lay summary content and the aim of the research project my aims to investigate factors that are suspected to cause cancer in children. In particular I would like to analyze the influence of ionizing radiation from space and ground, of radiation exposure due to inhalation of radon from air pollution by road transport and population flows, such as strong inflows of immigrants in small communities. The latter could lead to local clusters of infections could cause the cancer. Still, I'll examine whether cancer spatially and temporally more frequently occurs in children. This could be a further indication that infections could cause cancer in children. This paper examines some of the suspected causes of cancer in children with a better spatial and temporal resolution than previous studies scientific and social context. The gained findings will help improve, to estimate the true cost of preventable environmental loads, such as E.g. heavy road traffic, and to identify ways to avoid.
