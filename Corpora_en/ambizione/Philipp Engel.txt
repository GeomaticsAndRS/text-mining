Honey bees are home to lead a unique bacterial community in their gastrointestinal tract, which are specifically in the course of evolution has adapted to this environment. As also in the human stomach intestinal bacteria of honey bees can play an important role for the health of their host. However, the precise functions of these bacteria are still largely unknown despite the central importance of bees for agriculture and ecosystem. Lay summary that core goal of this research project will be closer to characterize the interactions between bacteria and honey bees.  This sterile bees in the lab with specific bacterial isolates are colonized. The focus will be on a specific bacteria that colonized the gastric intestinal wall of the bee and is thus in close interaction with the host. We will examine the influence of this bacterium on various economic factors, including immune system and disease resistance. Furthermore, we will determine genetic factors of this bacterium, which are important for the colonization of the host. As pollinators of a variety of plants, the honey bee is an insect of central importance for the environment and agriculture. Our work will uncover new and important insights into the influence of intestinal bacteria on bee health. With regard to the worldwide increasing occurrence of bee, this could lead to new strategies, eg. in the fight against and prevention of diseases. Furthermore, the honey bee, on the basis of the simple composition of bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract, represents an excellent model to examine general relationships between bacteria and host.  Therefore research is pointing out our basic principles of complex interactions between gut bacteria and host.
