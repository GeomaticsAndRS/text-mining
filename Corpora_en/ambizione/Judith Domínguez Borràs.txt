Lead the emotional stimuli provide information essential to the survival of human beings. To effectively treat this information, our brain is more efficient in response to stimuli emotional qu? to those non-emotionnelles. However, the brain mechanisms that make this possible are still uncertain. The amygdala is a nucleus that could be decisive in this process, but his interactions with the other regions of the brain and the role of different subdivisions that make up are still TBD. We will examine this aspect with l? using a combination of two techniques d? recording of neuronal responses to a single precision on the human level. Lay summary contents and objectives of the research work modern neuro-imaging techniques have enabled significant advances in the understanding of the processes emotional humans, but this approach is limited and some information remains inaccessible. We will explore the functions of the amygdala and other regions of the brain in epileptic preoperative patients in two experiments. Patients respond to emotional, non-emotionnels, Visual or auditory stimuli, and consciously or unconsciously perceived. At the same time, the electrical activity of individual neurons component l? tonsil will be directly recorded, a rare procedure in l?human and high precision. Â  Scientific and social context of the research project the results of this project can provide a valuable knowledge on the functioning of l? amygdala and in particular its role in emotional processes, and will also make possible the comparison of human and animal models. D? on the other hand, this may help understand some psychiatric disorders associated with dysfunction of the amygdala, as depression and l? anxiety.
