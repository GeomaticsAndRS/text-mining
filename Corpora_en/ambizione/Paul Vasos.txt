Lead Lay summary The duration of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is limited to the time interval after which the spins lose memory of their initial state, via relaxation mechanisms. Under particular conditions, a group of spins may be found in a state that is immune to relaxation processes, and therefore has a long lifetime; this is a long-lived state (LLS). This observation opens the way to NMR studies of slow transport and exchange phenomena, such as blood flow or certain dynamic events occurring in proteins and nucleic acids. Methods will be developed to use long-lived states in biomolecules, by extending these states to specific groups of spins in aminoacids. This will permit to characterise biomolecular conformations that occur in vivo in slow exchange with the native form, such as, for instance, equilibria between folded and unfolded states. The sensitivity of nuclear resonance experiments is intrinsically low, but it can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude (up to 10?000 times) through hyperpolarisation, that is, transfer of magnetisation from electron spins. We plan to use long-lived states as a reservoir and transport vector for hyperpolarised nuclear magnetisation, so the enhanced signals may be observed at the desired time and location, for instance in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To this effect, long-lived states will be generated in endogenous molecules that may be followed in vivo.
