Lead loess-Paleoboeden document the sequence of ice ages and interglacial periods during the Quaternary (the past 2.6 million years) and are valuable archives of climate and environmental history. Their potential could be but so far not extensively scientifically exploited, mainly due to the lack of methods, to obtain quantitative information about climate and landscape changes. Lay summary objectives and results of the research project the aim of the research project was to apply modern geochemical methods in various loess pale ob case from Europe, Central Asia, Siberia to provide a contribution to the reconstruction of the environmental conditions during the ice ages. Leaf waxes in the studied case of loess pale whether shows that deciduous trees in Sueosteuropa, Central Asia and southern Siberia were consistently present probably even in the ice ages. The deuterium isotopy class of the leaf waxes documented the lower temperatures during the cold periods. The GDGTs (membrane constituents of soil bacteria), however, show no consistent changes and require further exploration. Scientific and social context because large amounts of carbon in permafrost are stored and only in the last ice age were stored right, further research should be pursued, to reconstruct the former climate in Siberia and to investigate volume, age and stability of organic carbon in Siberian soils. Especially the combination of Deuteriumisotopie on leaf growth and Sauerstoffisotopie plant sugars has enormous potential for further climate - and environmental reconstruction based on loess pale whether Ã¶den and lake sediments.
