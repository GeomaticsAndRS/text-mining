Lead during a conversation, the incomplete speech of a speaker can be completed through an another spokesman. This common formulation of statements typically occurs with Word finding difficulties, can be observed as well as the common narrative or explanation. Although these so-called Ko constructions in typologically different languages have been observed, their variety of forms and their social functions have been described so far only insufficiently. Lay summary content and aim of the research project based on video recordings and transcriptions of everyday conversations in three languages should be explored, joint formulation activities occur in the expression and social tasks comply. The project should first figure out what kinds of Ko structures in the three target languages (German, French and Czech) and to what extent the grammatical properties of the language (I.e. Word order) allow for different forms of completions. Second examines whether common formulation is a basically cooperative action and like this alltagssprachliche phenomenon of speakers is used to negotiate argument positions and knowledge with each other. Scientific and social context on the one hand helps the development of a qualitativ-(sprach)vergleichenden the project approach and language spoken to a detailed description and applied grammatical structures. On the other hand, it allows to understand conversations in the joint formulation activities systematically be used not only as pure Exchange of information, but primarily as a social interaction. A precise distinction between cooperative and competitive language behavior can lead to a better understanding of private and professional situations. Â
