Novel materials which are intensely explored for several years are lead topological insulators. These systems are however not insulating, although their name suggests this. Actually they have metallic surfaces which can conduct current, even if the material is contaminated. In addition to possible electronic applications, these materials also from a fundamental perspective are interesting, because they establish a connection with the mathematical field of topology. Lay summary content and the aim of the research project: the overall objective is to find new material systems for topological insulators and theoretically to be able to describe. In particular, we want to better understand how interaction effects can affect the physics between electrons. We are the electronic structure of systems with the help of modern theoretical methods such as transition metal oxides and Kondo insulators from the mathematical point of view the topology check. Scientific and social context from a practical point of view, it is important to identify new material systems, in order to exploit the full potential of topological insulators. Possible applications of these systems are in nanoelectronics, spintronics and quantum computer platform.
