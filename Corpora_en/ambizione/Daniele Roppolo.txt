Lead plant cells and their wall can be compared to a room of air in a tire. The membrane, the cell border, is rich in proteins that allow the synthesis of the wall and determine the structure. The wall varies from cell to cell: the cell wall making up the cotton fibres is different from that of the cells that give rise to the wood, as well as the tread of the tyres of a motion is different from that of the tire of a bicycle Lay summary aims of the project: few known actors continuous dialogue between the membrane and the cell wallWhat proteins determine the shape of a wall? How to react to an external stimulus? This study is based on the recent identification of some proteins, which determine the formation of the root cell wall. These proteins belong to a large family, members of which? work? other facilities of the plant, for example the flower. Our guess is that these proteins are a family of stonemasons, each able to carve a unique wall. The origins of this family are found in the first plants appeared on land, whose descendants are the present-day mosses. This project will focus on the understanding of the working method?? of these proteins in the MOSS physcomitrella patens and It flowered in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Socio-scientific context without knowing it, many of us use daily plant cell walls: wood, cotton, paper are examples of traditional plant products. Recently biofuels, also they produced of the transformation of the plant walls, were imposed as a possible alternative for sustainable energy production. Basic research that will be carried out within the framework of this project, although not directly aimed at the production of biomaterials, could open up new ways forward for the sustainable use of plant resources.
