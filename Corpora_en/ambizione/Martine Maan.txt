Lead Lay summary Environmental heterogeneity exerts selection on animal morphology, behaviour, sensory systems and life-history. When the resulting adaptations also affect patterns of selective mating, populations may rapidly become reproductively isolated and form new species. This mechanism of species divergence is very powerful in theory, but its importance in the real world has been questioned. In this project, I conduct an experimental investigation of the idea that interactions between natural and sexual selection can in fact drive speciation in nature. The cichlid fish of Lake Victoria (East Africa) are textbook examples of explosive speciation: hundreds of species have evolved in a very short time. Many of these exhibit bright male coloration that affects both inter- and intraspecific female mate choice, indicating that sexual selection is important for species differentiation. At the same time, the fish show extensive variation in colour vision, apparently as an adaptation to their diverse visual environments. Possibly, visual adaptation to different light conditions changes female perception of male coloration, such that females that inhabit different light environments will develop different colour preferences. Such a tight link between ecological adaptation and mating behaviour could contribute to rapid speciation in cichlids as well as in other taxa. To test the role of visual adaptation in cichlid speciation, I use an experimental approach that incorporates visual genomics and perceptual modeling. This allows quantitative analyses at different levels of biological organisation: from pigment genes and pigment composition in the eye, to individual behaviour in controlled light conditions and biodiversity dynamics in natural communities. By investigating how ecological adaptation shapes female mate preferences, my study will provide insights in the interplay between natural and sexual selection during speciation.
