Metabolic Engineering of Cell Cycle Dynamics in Fultured Cells II The possibility to activate cell division by using cloned native genes under modified transcriptional control (see I) will be applied to reactivate tightly suppressed mitotic activity of terminally differentiated nonproliferative primary cells. We started the project by using cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes (ARC) which represent one such system well known in this laboratory (see above). A successful reactivation of proliferation of the permanently postmitotic ARC could lead to organ repair e.g. after heart infarction; however, it is not understood at all how cell division is blocked in heart cells at a time point during development; knowledge on cell cycle control in these cells is almost non existent. Experiments which should reveal presence or absence of a number of regulatory factors of the cell cycle like cyclins, cdc 2, E2F, cdk 2, pRB, p107, p53 are underway.
