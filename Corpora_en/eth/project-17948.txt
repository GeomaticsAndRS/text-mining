Nanocoils based on III-V compounds The primary objective of this research is to develop helical nanostructures based on III-V compounds. Because of their interesting morphology, as well as mechanical, electrical, and electromagnetic properties, these nanostructures can be used as components for micro and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) such as springs, magnetic field detectors, chemical or biological sensors, inductors, actuators, and high-performance electromagnetic wave absorbers. When used in conjunction with magnetic nanostructures, they can function as electromagnetic actuators. Having piezoresistive properties and low stiffness, nanocoils can be used as high-resolution electromechanical sensors. With suitable surface coating they can be functionalized to act as chemical or biological sensors. Moreover, with their high surface-to-volume ratio they can be used for temperature sensors and photoconductive detectors. Such structures are fabricated using conventional micromachining techniques. The focus of this effort is on design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of such devices. Another application of the helical nanostructures is as a propeller for microrobots similar to flagella. Apart from the helical nanocoils based on III-V compounds other self-formed three-dimensional structures have been fabricated and characterized.
