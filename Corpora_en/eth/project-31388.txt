The effect of creep on the interaction between TBM, lining and rock The ground response to tunneling is often time-dependent. The underlying mechanisms are creep in the case of low-permeability water-bearing ground - consolidation. Creep is important and U particularly for tunneling through squeezing ground, i.e. ground which is prone to large deformations. Although there are many theoretical and experimental studies on soil or rock creep, a systematic investigation of its effects on TBM tunneling is still missing. The goal of the present research project is to improve understanding of the influence of the creep (both of the ground and of typical backfilling materials) on the loading developing upon the advancing TBM shield as well on the final loading of the segmental lining. For this purpose we will use numerical models, taking into account the stress redistribution in the ground around the advancing TBM, the rheological behavior of the ground and of the backfilling material. The material behavior will be modeled based upon existing material models and results of own experiments.
