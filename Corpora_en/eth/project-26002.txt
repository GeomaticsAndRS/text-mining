Development of criteria for scale-up and scale-down of bioreactors for cultivation of mammalian cells Understand and improve the production of therapeutic proteins at manufacturing scale. The research aims of this project are: (1) Understanding the influence of different process parameters and (2) investigation of observed heterogeneities, seen in 15000L bioreactors, on product quantity and quality.
