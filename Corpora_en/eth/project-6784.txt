Corrosion Behavior of Newly Developed Iron Base Alloys One of the most important properties of the newly developed alloys which are characterized by exceptional strength, toughness, and acceptance by the human body is their extremely high corrosion resistance. Extensive systematic experiments concerning the effect of each alloy element as well as the structure of the material are under way which permit to explore successful development routes as well as to evaluate these new alloys by comparison with all other corrosion resistant materials available. Primary method is crevice corrosion experiments.
