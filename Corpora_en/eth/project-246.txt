Experimental Investigation of Bubbly Jets A variety of measurement techniques, including double optical probes, hot-wire anemometry and PIV are used. Of particular interest are the large structures in the jets. The experiments are conducted with monodisperse bubbly flows and variable bubble size. The project forms part of a joint ETH/PSI programme pertaining to the extension of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capabilities to dispersed two-phase flows; this programme encompasses experimental investigations in basic flows, modelling, direct numerical simulation, as well as validation of CFD codes. The general objectives of the proposed work on bubbly mixing-layers are to investigate experimentally the effects of bubbles (sizes and concentrations) on mixing-layer development, entrainment, mixing of scalars, the structures of coherent vortices and turbulence, as well as to analyse bubble dispersion and clustering. After preparatory tests on bubble injection and mixing-layer conditioning systematic experimental investigations are performed in a new vertical mixing-layer bubbly jet configuration. The experiments are conducted using visualisation techniques, local void fraction and velocity probes, and PIV. Special tasks of the project are to examine the effects of inlet conditions of the fluid and the bubble characteristics on mixing-layer development and bubble dispersion.
