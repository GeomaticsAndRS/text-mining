Silicon Vertex Detector For the H1 experiment at HERA, a double-layer, cylindrical central silicon tracker (CST) has been developed and constructed by ETH in collaboration with PSI. The silicon sensors are double layer with 0.025 mm strip pitch (0.050 mm readout pitch) on the p-side and 0.088 mm strip and readout pitch on the n-side. The full detector was installed in 1996 in the experiment and successfully operated since. Spatial resolutions of 0.015 mm on p-side and 0.022 mm on n-side at polar angles of 90 degrees have been achieved which corresponds to the expected numbers. For the HERA-II high luminosity upgrade, the Si-ladders were geometrically re-arranged into elliptical shape and the detector was equipped with radiation-hard readout electronics (produced in DMILL-technology). The detector serves as the standard tool for high-precision tracking in H1. It has been and continues to be successfully used for various measurements of heavy flavour production.
