Ceria-based materials have unique redox and oxygen storage properties, which make them attractive for automotive catalysts and catalysts for hydrogen purification in fuel cells. Synthesis of ceria nanomaterials with desirable composition and uniform morphology (size, shape, well-defined crystal planes) has become one of the essential topics in material science, since they often exhibit unusual physical properties and advanced catalytic performance when the dimensions are reduced to the nanometer scale. Thus, we aim to prepare a series of CeO2- x samples by different synthesis procedures including a number of soft chemistry methods, hydrothermal and high-temperature treatment. As a result, we aim to obtain nanomaterials with sizes range from 5-200 nm and multiple shapes: cubes, polyhedra, rods and spheres, and we aim to elucidate their redox properties.
