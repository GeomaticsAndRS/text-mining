Process engineering: Biocatalytic production of aromatic aldehydes. Aromatic aldehydes are valuable building blocks for flavours/fragrances and polymers. We are aiming at the regio and chemoselective oxygenation of toluene and its derivatives to substituted benzaldehydes using recombinant E. coli expressing xylene monooxygenase (XylMA). The basic biochemical concept is a multistep oxidation of toluene and its derivatives to corresponding alcohols and aldehydes with 02 by xylene monooxygenase. As a sound basis for the development of a stable bioprocess we investigate enzyme / whole cell kinetics, biocatalyst stability, mass transfer and toxicity. This will allow the development of a biotransformation process with integrated product recovery and simple down stream processing.
