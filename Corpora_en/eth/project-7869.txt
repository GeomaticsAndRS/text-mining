Packaging of High Speed Semiconductor Lasers, Modulators, Switches and Electronic Drivers In our approach, the waveguide device is flip-chip mounted on a Si motherboard combining the optical waveguide to single mode fiber array coupling (see: Low Cost Packaging of Laser Array Modules for Data Communication Applications). The specially developed high speed drivers are soldered close to the active waveguide device on heatsinks to provide a good heat dissipation. The drivers and the OEIC are thermally decoupled to minimize the thermal influence on the waveguide device or to ease its thermal stabilization with a Peltier cooler, if necessary. The electrical connections of the HBT drivers to standard high speed connectors are carried out with coplanar transmission lines on microwave substrates, taking advantage of the possibility to adapt the width of the transmission lines at the connector and the driver side while maintaining the electrical impedance and to avoid contact holes to the backside.
