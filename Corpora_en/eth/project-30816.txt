Model-based estimates of dopaminergic and cholinergic influences on synaptic plasticity during sensory and reinforcement learning In this project we use fMRI, hierarchical Bayesian models and dynamic causal models of neuronal populations to infer dopaminergic and cholinergic influences on synaptic plasticity during sensory and reinforcement learning.
