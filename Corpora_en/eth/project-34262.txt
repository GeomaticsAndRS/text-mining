Electricity Storage via Adiabatic Air Compression This project provides an integrated investigation along a value chain of advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) for large-scale energy storage of electricity. The project develops the science and technology, and examines the environmental and economic impacts. The overall objectives of the joint project are: (1) to demonstrate a combined sensible/latent-heat storage at an industrially relevant scale for use in AA-CAES and (2) to assess the environmental and economic potential of AA-CAES as an alternative to pumped hydro electricity storage in Switzerland.
