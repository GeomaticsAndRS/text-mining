DELOS Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries The aim of the Network of Excellence on Digital Libraries (DLs) is to provide an open context in which an international research agenda for future research activities in the digital library domain can be developed and continuously updated. It constitutes a reference point for all DL projects funded by the 5th FP-IST (Information Societies Technology), stimulating the exchange of experiences and know-how in this multidisciplinary domain, and also establishes close contacts with relevant application communities. It makes testbeds available, facilitates their interoperability, and provides mechanisms for the evaluation of models, techniques, and approaches, and the exchange of open-source software components. It contributes to the definition of relevant standards. Appropriate take-up models are studied to facilitate the exploitation of the new DL technologies in the industrial/commercial environment. A network of links with the international DL research community is created.
