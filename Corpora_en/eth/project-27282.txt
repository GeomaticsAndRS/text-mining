Susceptibility of alpine catchment flood runoff to changes in meteorogical boundary conditions (SAC-FLOOD) Due to climate change more intensive rain events are expected. This will translate into higher runoff and floods. The research interest lies on threshold behaviour of those Alpine catchments which presently still attenuate runoff due to storage capacity.
