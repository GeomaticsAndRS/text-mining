3D permeability patterns in fractured crystalline rocks Predicting local permeability structures and magnitudes in crystalline rocks is far from trivial. This project aims at improving our predictive capabilities based on unique 3D data sets from ore mines in Saxony. Predicting local permeability structures and magnitudes in crystalline rocks is far from trivial. The target depth of our investigations are the first 2 kilometers of the continental crust, where most of the practically relevant activities (hydrothermal and hydrocarbon energy production, carbon storage, mining, tunneling, geological waste disposal) take place. This project aims at improving our predictive capabilities based on statistical correlation analyses and physical modeling. The analysis is based on unique fully 3-dimensional structural, mineralogical and hydrological data sets from ore and uranium mines in the Erzgebirge of Saxony (e.g. Pöhla, Schlema-Alberoda, Marienberg, Annaberg, Niederschlag). In a first phase of the project (20
