ARES: An ATM Real Time Simulator for Quality of Service Assessment With the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technique foreseen for the emerging B-ISDN (Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network), new types of impairments will be introduced such as loss, corruption or variable delay of data packets (cells). These impairments are the result of complicated mechanisms involving source coding, allocation of network resources, source policing, etc. For two-way interactive services (such as telephony and various forms of multimedia interpersonal communication), the Quality of Service (QoS) ultimately experienced by customers can only be determined under real-time conditions. Our ARES machine allows to simulate the behaviour of ATM channels in real-time, with performance degradations (such as delay variations or errors) injected according to statistical parameters derived previously in off-line simulations for various network configurations and assumptions about background traffic. Thus, systematic subjective evaluation of transmission quality may take place in a realistic environment, i.e. with real end systems connected to the ARES machine.
