Qualification profiles in the Swiss market of environmental expert services Enforced by legal regulations, a market for environmental expert services has come into existence in Switzerland. In the year 1997, there were several studies on this market. Our project aims are (i) to aggregate and pool this data; (ii) to describe empirical qualification profiles by using models of qualification; (iii) to test these profiles as predictors for professional success. To this end, we will describe three models of qualification that assist in integrating the 1997-data: the psychological model for individual expertise (focusing on professional experience); the concept of key competencies (focusing on general qualifications); and the component model of science-based academic education (focusing on disciplinary knowledge). Our theoretical background reflects the approach by Abbott (1988): professional competition depends on activity specific knowledge. This approach has been successfully applied to the Swiss market for environmental expert services by Mieg (1998, 2002). In autumn 2001, we carried out an encompassing market survey (Nvalid responses=3.361).
