Entwicklung eines neuartigen Messsystems zur präzisen Strommessung sehr kurzzeitiger Hochstromimpulse Optical current sensor based on the farraday effect with high bandwidth and high accuracy In modern solid state modulator applications like Free Electron lasers, highly accurate pulses are required (error <10^-5). Also, these pulses have very short rise times (<1us). In order to measure these pulses, a highly accurate current measurement is required. In this project, a highly accurate, high bandwidth current sensor based on the faraday effect is developed. Since the sensor itself is based on optical components, it also provides a galvanically isolated measurement. To achieve a measurment accuracy <10^-5 with a rise time <1us, new concepts concerning the optical components as well as the analog and digital signal analysis are investigated.
