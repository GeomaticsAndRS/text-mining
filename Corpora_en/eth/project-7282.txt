Epitaxial Lift Off and its Applications Epitaxial lift off (ELO) is a technology by which epitaxially grown layers are taken off from their growth substrate and are subsequently re-attached to a new host substrate. In the contents of a European research project GaAs MESFETs and circuits fabricated on the D07A foundry process from Philips Microwave were transplanted onto InP, Si and quartz. Microwave and noise performance of devices and circuits were studied before and after transplantation. One goal of this project is to build monolithic integrated high speed optical access nodes for fiber optical communication networks. Using this technique chips containing GaAs circuits and InP based electro-optic components have been fabricated. Additional ~ information can be found in: http://www.ife.ee.ethz.ch/morf/
