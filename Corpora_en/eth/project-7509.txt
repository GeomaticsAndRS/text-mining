The Time Path of the Geodynamical and Geochemical Evolution of the Ivreazone (NItaly) The Ivreazone represents a well known section across the lower continental crust. Though a large dataset is available from literature including petrological, structural, geochemical and geophysical measurements, absolute ages of many events such as magma emplacements, high temperature deformation, tilting from horizontal to vertical position and uplift are scarce. U-Pb-ages of zircons from various rocks using the SHRIMP and Fission Track ages of zircons and apatites are produced in order to fill this gap. In addition, high pressure experiments on natural samples are carried out for estimating some critical P-T-x conditions of metamorphism, and field studies on a scale of 1 : 25000 in areas not yet well knwon, i.e. in between the Val Strona and the northeastern end of the Ivreazone, will complement our knowledge on the composition and structure of the Ivreazone.
