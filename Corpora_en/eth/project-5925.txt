Enantioselective Gaschromatographic Separation of Pharmaceuticals Stereochemical properties have a great influence on the activity of chiral drugs. Activity, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of enantiomers may differ, in some cases even one of the optical antipodes is much more toxic. In the Pharmacopeia the only criteria for enantiomeric purity is optical rotation. Because the limit of detection for enantiomeric impurities with this method is high, recently developed chromatographic enantiomer separation techniques are of great interest for the optical purity tests of pharmaceuticals. Enantioselective gaschromatographic separations can be achieved with cyclodextrin derivatives as chiral selectors in the stationary phase. For liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) the chiral selector is either bonded to the stationary phase or added to the mobile phase. The enantioselectivity of the cyclodextrins depends on the different ring sizes of the basic \ga-, \gb-, and \gg- cyclodextrins and on the derivatisation of the hydroxyl groups on the cyclodextrin ring. Chiral capillary columns with different cyclodextrin derivatives are developed for gaschromatographic separation of racemic pharmaceuticals. Separation systems and derivatisation reactions are investigated for several chiral drugs. The results obtained are compared with other chromatographic techniques like HPLC, TLC and CE.
