Serpentinization, Fluids and Life: Comparing Carbon and Sulfur Cycles in Modern and Ancient Environments The alteration of mantle rocks to serpentinite is a fundamental process with geophysical, geochemical and biological importance for the global marine system. This project is a comparative biogeochemical study of the Lost City system (MAR) with modern and ancient serpentinite-carbonate systems.
