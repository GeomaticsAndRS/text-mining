Analysis of Optical Waveguide Structures with Beam Propagation Method The Beam Propagation Method (BPM) is well established for the calculation of wave propagation in integrated optical waveguide structures. The project was initially supported by Swiss National Science Foundation. The work has been continued with further collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The technique of the imaginary distance beam propagation (ID-BPM) has been investigated to efficiently determine eigenmodes of waveguide structures with arbitrary index-distributions. The fundamental mode of a waveguide structure has the largest propagation constant and sees the most rapid phase oscillations during propagation. If the propagation distance is along an imaginary axis, the phase oscillations turn into gain and the fundamental mode is amplified the most. This technique was implemented for the semivectorial finite difference wave equation in the paraxial limit. With optimised parameter sets, and especially with very large imaginary distances per propagation step, the fundamental mode can be determined within a few ID-BPM steps.
