Ca isotopes during incipient weathering in a granitic soil sequence The goal of this project is to provide new constraints on the chemical processes involved in the dissolution of silicate rocks at the Earth's surface. This project will focus on calcium isotope geochemistry, since Ca is an major constituent in minerals, playing a key role in chemical weathering.
