In vivo three-dimensional monitoring of implant osseointegration and anchorage in healthy and osteoporotic bone The proposed study characterizes various biological and biomechanical aspects of implant integration and anchorage at different hierarchical levels in a mouse model for healthy and osteoporotic bone. Osteoporosis, a common skeletal disease in the elderly population, is characterized by a reduction in bone strength followed by a corresponding increase in the probability of fracture. Successful therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis have been developed, however little is known on the influence of this disease on implant integration and anchorage. The proposed study will systemically characterize various biological and biomechanical aspects of implant integration and anchorage at different hierarchical levels. An improvement in the understanding of these mechanisms could lead to novel strategies in the management of osteoporotic fractures. We hypothesize that the main reasons for the reduced implant stability in osteoporotic bone include a different bone response to implant insertion, a reduction in peri-implant bone quality and a weaker bonding strength of the bone-implant interface of osteoporotic bone compared to healthy bone. This research aims to investigate these various aspects to obtain the knowledge needed to improve implant stability in osteoporotic bone.
