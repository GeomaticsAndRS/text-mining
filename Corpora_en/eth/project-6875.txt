Structure of polymers and heterogeneous materials at the molecular level studied by NMR In collaboration with the group of Prof. Ulrich W. Suter at the Insitute of Polymers of ETH, we are developing and applying solid-state NMR techniques to study disordered systems. These techniques can measure specific structural parameters, such as dihedral angles, interatomic distances, and relative orientations of nearest-neighbour molecular fragments, even if these parameters are widely distributed. Besides the development of new experimental schemes, the research focuses on three topics. First, we study the detailed conformation and packing of polymer chains to be able to generate realistic computer simulations of glassy polymers at the atomistic level. Second, we investigate the structural changes after plastic deformation of polymers in order to clarify the mechanisms of this process. Third, in collaboration with the group of Prof. Paul Smith, an effort is made to characterize the structure of heterogeneous materials, especially multi-phase and supramolecular systems with highly anisotropic properties.
