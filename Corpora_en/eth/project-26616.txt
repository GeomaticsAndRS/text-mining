Form Finding of Fabric Formwork for Concrete Shells This research is developing a new form finding approach for the design of flexible formwork, consisting of pre-stressed structural membranes, for the construction of thin, anticlastic, concrete shells. The approach is based on the Force Density Method and an adaptation of the non-linear extension of Thrust Network Analysis (TNA). Relevant aspects of TNA are the use of reciprocal diagrams to control the forces in indeterminate networks. The strategy uses an overall optimization process for finding the closest possible tension-only, equilibrium surface to a given target surface under the appropriate loading (i.e. weight of the concrete).
