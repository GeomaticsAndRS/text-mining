New information on the paramagnetic states of Methyl-Coenzyme M Reductase (MCR) Methyl-Coenzyme M Reductase (MCR) catalyses the reaction of methyl-coenzyme M (CH3- SCoM) with coenzyme B (HS-CoB) to methane and CoM-S-S-CoB. Depending on the isolation conditions, MCR is found in different oxidation states, some of which are EPR active. Although ´ crystal structures of the diamagnetic and SinactiveS Ni(II) species exist, it has not been possible ´ to obtain X-ray structures of the enzymatically SactiveS paramagnetic species. Hence EPR is the method of choice to get geometric and electronic information on the paramagnetic states of MCR, which is needed to determine the catalytic cycle. To date we have successfully characterised the MCR red2 state, and have shown that the substrate CoM is bound to the Ni(I) centre and that the electronic structure of the macrocycle is significantly altered from the other paramagnetic states on the enzyme.
