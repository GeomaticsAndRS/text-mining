Medium Access Control Algorithms for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) provide short range communication links between quite different mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDA), notebooks and portable computers, headsets, sensors and mobile phones. These communication networks have a rather limited range of about 10 meters allowing to build small and cheap mobile devices with considerably less battery power consumption than in the case of ordinary wireless local area networks. The Bluetooth special interest group has specified a first generation of WPAN systems. The next generation will provide higher data rates and a medium access control (MAC) protocol for an improved resource management with support of quality of service (QoS). In this new research project MAC protocols for WPAN systems are investigated. The work is based on the results of an earlier project on MAC protocols for Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) Access Networks and on current proposals for WPANs. The requirements for protocols for WPAN systems such as low complexity of the algorithms and low power consumption have to be taken into account. Multiple traffic classes with different QoS requirements need to be supported. This is necessary for the transmission of multimedia streams. For the analysis and the simulation of the MAC algorithms a system model is needed which includes the physical layer and the air interface. With a model of channel fading and interference the robustness of the MAC algorithms to variable bit error rates can be evaluated. The objective of the project is to compare and optimize different proposed MAC protocols by means of simulation as well as by analytical methods.
