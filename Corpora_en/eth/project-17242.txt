Reliability of the Swiss Road Network The aim of this project is to develop a method for the assessment of direct and indirect consequences of different adverse events on the road network. The envisaged method should be based on recent scientific developments in the field of risk based decision making. This research project is part of the Swiss Federal Roads Authority (ASTRA) framework project ´ SThe Reliability of the Road Traffic system and its StructuresS. The general objective of this framework research program is the development of a decision support methodology which enables the efficient and sustainable allocation of new investments into the road network to the overall ´ benefit of the Swiss society. The aim of this sub-project SReliability of a Road networkS is to develop a method for the assessment of direct and indirect consequences of different adverse events on the road network. The envisaged method should be based on recent scientific developments in the field of risk based decision making. At the same time the method should be applicable and communicable. In the first part of the project the relevant components of the road network are identified and described. Kernel of the project is the development of a network model for T ¸ the description and assessment of risks and the availability of transport capacity, and for T ¸ the evaluation of the efficiency of safety measures. The project has been initiated in June 2006 and will run for 16 month.
