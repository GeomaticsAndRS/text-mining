Simulation and Reconstruction of AMS Data To reach the ultimate precision in searching antinuclei with the Alpha Magnet Spectrometer (AMS), it is important to not misinterpret any normal particles that did some rare reactions with the detector material (large angle multiple scattering, nuclear reactions, etc.). Therefore a reconstruction program is needed that is able to identify and reject such events with very high accuracy while keeping the acceptance for real antiparticles high. To develop and test the reconstruction (and to optimize the design of the detector) a precise monte carlo simulation of the experiment is going on. Because the dangerous background events are rare, a huge amount of simulated data is needed.
