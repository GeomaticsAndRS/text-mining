Industrial Image Production. On the Rationalization of Advertisement Design, 1945U1975 The project is concerned with a history of advertisement image production between 1945 and 1975. Special emphasis will be laid on the process of advertisement image production in advertising agencies with regard to the forms and contents of cooperation between management, research and design. The modern advertisement is a hybrid construct, a product of the (often conflict-laden) communication processes between managers, researchers and designers and their ways of building an image. Yet a practical history of advertisement design has largely been neglected by the history of advertising, art history, cultural and media studies. This project focuses on the specific historical production sites within which advertisements were actually planned, drafted and designed: European post-World War II advertising agencies housing research departments such as the J. Walter Thompson Company in London. Furthermore, focusing on the triangle of agency management, advertising research and advertisement design allows reconsidering the question of what constitutes an advertisement; in particular: What is the practical knowledge of advertisement design? What forms of >Bildwissen<were produced in the processes between planning and designing ads and what were their functions? What differing views on value, function and aesthetics of ads circulated in networks of an agency and how were they negotiated? And finally: To what extent have psychological and physiological concepts of the eye and the gaze interacted with or been incorporated in the actual production of advertisement images?
