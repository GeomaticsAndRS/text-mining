Molecular Kinetics and Spectroscopy: Highest Resolution FTIR-Spectroscopy Including Experiments at the Swiss Light Source Polyatomic molecules are investigated by high resolution interferometric Fou\-rier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The main goal of the investigations is to elucidate the primary processes of intramolecular energy flow in polyatomic molecules (femtosecond to nanosecond time scale) including isotope effects.
