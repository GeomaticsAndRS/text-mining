UltraVR - Ultrasound Imaging Simulation for Virtual Reality Training Ultrasound imaging is a low-cost, real-time, non-ionizing image modality. The interpretation of ultrasound images with concurrent manipulation of ultrasound transducer is, however, a complex task requiring substantial training, which is addressed hereby via virtual reality simulation of images.
