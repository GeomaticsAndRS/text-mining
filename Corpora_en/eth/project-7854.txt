InGaAs/InP-Heterobipolar Transistor (HBT) High Speed Electronics InGaAs/InP HBTs have a number of advantages over GaAs-based HBTs including: higher electron mobility and transient velocity overshoot, lower base-emitter turn-on voltage and substrate compatibility with 1.3 and 1.55 \gmm optical sources and detectors.Two classes of devices are realized in our research group: InP-collector double heterostructure bipolar transistors (DHBTs) with excellent high speed, maximum current and breakdown voltage capabilities and single heterostructure bipolar transistors (SHBTs) with very good high speed performance. In contrast to most other groups we do not use UHV-based techniques for the growth of the HBT structures, but we rely on MOVPE. This method is able to cover larger areas or number of wafers per run within considerably shorter growth cycle periods. The DHBTs are employed in driver circuits for external and direct modulation in optical fiber links. An IC was realized, which operates up to 12 Gb/s with maximum output voltages of 3.5 V across 25 Ohm and current swings of 140 m. This versatile circuit can be used for driving both lasers and optical switches. The IC was fabricated with DHBTs having a f$_{T}$of 66 GHz and a f$_{max}$of 107 GHz. Maximum collector current density J$_{C}$reaches up to 2.0° u10$^{5}$A/cm$^{2}$and a breakdown voltage BV$_{CEO}$of 12.5 V is achieved. The SHBTs fabricated in our group are optimized for high speed performance with f$_{T}$= 101 GHz and f$_{max}$= 221 GHz. The value for f$_{max}$is one of the highest ever reported for InGaAs/InP HBTs. Various SHBT circuits have been realized, some of them in collaboration with the IFE group. A multiplexer operating up to 20 Gb/s, an AGC amplifier with 10 GHz bandwidth and a monolithically integrated photoreceiver with 20 Gb/s speed capability are examples of circuits realized so far. InGaAs resistors with low sheet resistance and consequently large dimensions have been identified as a speed limiting factor in our circuits and have recently been replaced by NiCr thin-film resistors. This is expected to speed our HBT circuit performance up into the 40 Gb/s range.
