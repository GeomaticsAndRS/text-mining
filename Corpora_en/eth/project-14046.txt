Multivariate extremes We extend classical one-dimensional extreme value theory to arbitrary dimensions using a more geometry based approach. We offer a more geometry based approach for the modelling of multivariate extremes. A multivariate version of the Generalised Pareto Distribution as a conditional limit law for exceedances over high threholds is obtained. The theory is applied to the modelling of extreme market movements in financial risk management.
