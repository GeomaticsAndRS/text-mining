Biomaterial-based drug and antigen delivery systems Composite biomaterials are studied for drug and antigen microencapsulation to improve biodegradation characteristics with less pH-changes, stricter control of release kinetics, and the possibility to functionalize the surface of the particulates for targeting to specific cells. Micro- and nanoencapsulation technologies has become very promising tools for the protection and delivery of peptide and protein drugs and antigens. So far, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymers were the most widely studied and used materials for this purpose. However, PLGA-types suffer from several drawbacks in terms of interactions with the bioactive components and lack of easy possibilities for surface modifications. In this project we develop technologies that are suitable for the microencapsulation of drugs and antigens into composite biomaterials. The expected benefit of these novel particulate delivery systems are improved compatibility between polymeric material and drug/antigen, improved biodegradation characteristics with less pH-changes, stricter control of release kinetics, and the possibility to functionalize the surface of the particulates for targeting to specific cells, e.g., dendritic cells or cancer cells.
