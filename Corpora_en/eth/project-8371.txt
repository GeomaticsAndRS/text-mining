SMetabolic ¸ engineering of hybrid aspenTˇ (in collaboration with Prof. H. Haggman, Univ. Oulu, Finland) Our findings suggest that VHb-positive aspen lines have improved energy metabolism. We will analyze the role of hemoglobin expression in cellular physiology. The role of heterologous hemoglobin expression against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and during pathogen attack will be studied. Native
