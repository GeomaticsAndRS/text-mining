Design of seismic metamaterials for earthquake hazard mitigation This project investigates the implementation of locally resonant metamaterials in seismic isolation applications, by exploring their potential feasibility in the 0.5-5Hz frequency band. This project investigates the implementation of locally resonant metamaterials in seismic isolation applications, by exploring their potential feasibility in the 0.5-5Hz frequency band. Via adoption of the generalized form of BlochSs theorem, the one-dimensional mass-in-mass lattice is analyzed in three overlapping sub-bands and corresponding relations for the structural parameters are derived (Table 1). Accordingly, a basic unit cell is proposed (Fig.1), which incorporates a core of dense material that is suspended to a thin shell composed of a lightweight material. Initial numerical simulations on finite dimensional lattices reveal significant potential in the proposed solution
