Interplay of strain and defect formation in perovskite materials A crystal under epitaxial strain may, depending on partial gaz pressures in itâ€™s environment, respond to strain by spontaneous formation of point defects. This project aims to predict such defect formation energies and rationalise their behaviour in terms of the electronic structure.
