Dual-regulated expression of C/EBP-alpha and BMP-2 enables differential differentiation of C2C12 cells into adipocytes and osteoblasts We have engineered C2C12 cells for dual-regulated expression of human C/EBP-alpha and BMP-2 to enable independent transcription control of both differentiation factors using clinically licensed antibiotics of the streptogramin (pristinamycin) and tetracycline (tetracycline) classes.
