State and polity in Latin America between global economy and national society Employing both a quantitative and qualitative comparative design (cross-national, regime comparisons, case study comparisons) this research investigates processes transforming state and polity in Latin America during the 20th century. It aims at integrating different theoretical concepts - such as populism, clientelism, corporatism, political regimes, democracy and human rights, structural adjustment - within a general framework focussing on three basic transformation processes: 1) Changing patterns of the relationships between state and civil society; 2) the process of (re)democratization and, (3) changing development models (export-oriented growth models vs. import-substituting development). Each of these processes is examined in detail: Patterns of state-civil society relationships are examined in relation to the evolution of political regimes using country case studies as well as comparative quantitative analyses of different types of political regimes. The empirical examination of the Latin American redemocratization process employs 17 time-series indicators for 21 countries referring to different dimensions of democracy (electoral participation, party competition and human rights violations). The economic transformation from import-substituting industrialization to an export-led growth model aimed at by the implementation of structural adjustment policies is examined by comparing the experiences of Mexico and Costa Rica.
