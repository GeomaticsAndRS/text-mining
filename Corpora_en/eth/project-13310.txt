A Manual for Program Evaluation (Mandate of the Swiss Virtual Campus) Programs that aim to promote new technologies in higher education are often implemented by a variety of groups, each contributing through an individual project to the programSs objectives. This diversity presents a conundrum: How can we gain information about the overall impact of multi-project programs while at the same time taking the unique contributions of different projects into account? Clearly it is difficult to assess program impact by examining evaluation reports of individual projects. What we need is a method for the systematic collection and analysis of data across projects. This method must take into account the diversity of projects within a given program and, at the same time, allow for the integration of project evaluations, thereby providing information about the programSs success. The purpose of the mandate will thus be the development of a manual for program evaluation that provides concrete guidelines for the collection, analysis, and integration of evaluation data across projects. The method we propose will allow the identification of strengths and weaknesses not only of single projects, but also of an overall program. By building on the expert knowledge of our partners from several Swiss universities and on the findings of two ETH evaluation projects we will develop a manual, which will be tested in a varie- c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.

Our overall objective is to provide a tool that draws on the know-how acquired in multiple ICT-evaluations, and which provides a basis for the ´ ´ efficient design of future evaluations to be conducted by the SVC or by the Scompetence centresS which are established at the universities.
