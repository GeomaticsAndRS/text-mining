Integrated 3D urban modeling and scene understanding The aim of the project is the automatic generation of virtual 3D city models. We will develop computer vision techniques able to jointly solve 3D reconstruction and semantic labelling, leading to more complete and accurate, interpreted 3D models. The aim of the project is the automatic generation of virtual 3D city models. To convert image data to a 3D city model one needs to solve two computer vision problems: on the one hand the 3D scene geometry must be reconstructed; on the other hand the data must be interpreted, i.e. structured into semantically meaningful entities (buildings, roads, trees, etc.). A crucial point, which is not yet ° objects of different semantic properly accounted for, is that the two tasks are not independent U classes have different geometric properties, and vice versa the geometric shape and extent is an important cue about the semantic object class of a surface. In this project we will develop computer vision techniques able to jointly solve 3D reconstruction and semantic labelling, leading to more complete and accurate, interpreted 3D models.
