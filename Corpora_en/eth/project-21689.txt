Systems UNICELLSYS: Eukaryotic Unicellular Organism Biology U Biology of the Control of Cell Growth and Proliferation The overall objective of UNICELLSYS is a quantitative understanding of fundamental characteristics of eukaryotic unicellular organism biology: How cell growth and proliferation are controlled and coordinated by extracellular and intrinsic stimuli. ordinary bakerSs Bringing together 16 leading institutions in Europe, this project uses yeast U as a model organism for systems biology. By joining the experimental and computational yeast U expertise, we aim to understand how cells integrate external and internal signal to finally control their growth and proliferation. The long-range aim is to generate computer replicas of larger parts and to correctly predict U the behaviour of yeast cells in diffeof the yeast cell and to simulate U rent situations, such as stress or starvation. Technology for such computer simulations as well as knowledge gained from yeast is expected to be suitable also for generating computer models from human cells and eventually in the next 20 years or so also from entire human.
