Mutually consistent tomographic models of crust, upper mantle and the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary region underneath Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. We will bridge gaps between seismic maps of the Earth's upper mantle underlying Europe and the Mediterranean, derived from seismic recordings at very different frequencies. We focus on relatively low-frequency data, including teleseismic surface waves and regional ambient-noise cross-correlation.
