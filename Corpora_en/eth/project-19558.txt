Selective grain growth of bcc metal thin films under ion irradiation In this project, we focus on a systematic investigation of the basic interaction mechanisms of grain boundaries with defects induced by ion bombardment. Particular emphasis will be put on defect-induced grain-growth in thin metal films.
