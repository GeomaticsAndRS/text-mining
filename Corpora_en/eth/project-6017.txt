Functional Surfaces for Tribocorrosion (Micro-Tribocorrosion) Tribocorrosion deals with the interaction of mechanical (wear) and chemical (corrosion) degradation phenomena leading to performance degradation and system failure. It represents an important economic factor for Swiss Industry, including precision machines and devices, food processing, transportation systems as well as coating and lubricant fabrication. Tribocorrosion phenomena are unsufficiently understood at present and more reliable methods for the prediction and optimization of tribological systems are needed. The present project uses mechanical, electrochemical and surface science methods for the investigation of friction and wear behaviour of selected systems in corrosive environment on the macroscopic, microscopic and molecular level. The goal is to identify relevant tribocorrosion mechansisms as a prerequesite for the developement of predictive test methods and for the optimization of environment compatible tribological systems. Selected coating systems produced by PVD and galvanic methods as well as passivating alloys will be studied in close contact with the industrial partners.
