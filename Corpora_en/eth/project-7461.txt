The Origin and Early Development of the Moon The moon is commonly considered to be the product of a collision between the proto-Earth and a smaller impactor planet. The W isotopic heterogeneity on the Moon provides evidence that this giant impact happened between about 50 and 70 Myrs after the start of the solar system. This age for the Moon is based on the assumption that the variable tungsten isotope composition measured in lunar samples formed from formerly live 182Hf. Although this is reasonable it has also been considered feasible that the W isotopic heterogeneity reflects incomplete mixing of debris form the proto-Earth and impactor planet ("Theia") or that perhaps the heterogeneity reflects incomplete admixing of chondritic W added to the Moon after it formed. In this project we will investigate such inheritance models by searching for mass-independent oxygen isotope variations in lunar samples. Several decades ago it was shown that lunar rocks plot within a 0.3 ä wide array on the terrestrial fractionation line. We will use, therefore, new developed high-precision infra-red laser fluorination techniques. Laser fluorination has significantly improved the precision of such measurements and the ability to resolve small heterogeneity. For this study lunar mare basalts, highland rocks, KREEP basalts, and volcanic glasses from Apollo missions 11, 12, 15, 16, and 17 have been selected which have been previously analyzed for W isotopes. In addition, we will investigate small fragments of other lunar rocks including soil samples and breccias. These samples might have perhaps preserve some meteoritic remnants from the late lunar bombardment.
