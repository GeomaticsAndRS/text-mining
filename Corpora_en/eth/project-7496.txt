Continuous Orogenesis Field studies in the Czech Republic by students working jointly with Prof. Karel Schulmann have indicated that magma emplacement is closely related to the development of normal faults formed between transcurrent faults moving at different speeds. Computer modelling incorporating lower crustal rheology and melting is being combined into pressure-temperature-time (PTt) paths for pluton emplacement in continually evolving orogens.
