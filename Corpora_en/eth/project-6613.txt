Operation and Migration of IT Application Systems Many IT systems in business applications have a lifespan of ten to twenty years or more. During this length they have to be adapted since the application and the IT platforms in use may change substantially. The costs connected with all such adaptations (IT maintenance) of aging systems ("legacy systems") are often higher then their original development costs. Nevertheless this maintenance work is not popular, and the same holds for research on it. This project investigates on the one hand several aspects of systems maintenance and their migration to follow-up systems. On the other hand these IT activities are embedded into a general view over the whole development and exploitation length of application systems. Examples are taken from practical applications, in particular from those with Year-2000-problems.
