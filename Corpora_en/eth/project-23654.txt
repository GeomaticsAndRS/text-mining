Future glacier evolution and consequences for the hydrology and the potential for glacier hazards (FUGE) This proposal focuses on - A detailed regional analysis of glacier mass balance changes in the last 50-100 years - The determination of past and present glacier volumes - Future projections of glacier changes up to 2050 - Impact of the glacier volume change on hydrology, hydropower and hazards
