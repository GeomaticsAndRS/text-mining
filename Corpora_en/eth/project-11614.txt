Optimization of the velocity field in rotor-stator whipping heads with respect to resulting bubble size distribution Air cells/bubbles in aerated food systems like mousse products have to be smaller than about 10-20 microns and narrowly distributed. To what extent this is reached depends on the velocity field in the dispersing tool (whipping head). How to optimize it with respect to the complex non-Newtonian rheol
