Analysis Of Historic Masonry Structures This research applies Thrust Network Analysis, a three-dimensional computational method for obtaining lower-bound solutions of masonry vaults with complex geometries. The method extends thrust-line analysis to three-dimensional problems by finding equilibrium force networks within the vaultt's geometry, representing possible paths of the compression forces. Through case studies, this research demonstrates the potential of the method as a powerful tool for understanding, visualizing and exploring the equilibrium of compression-only structures. This method has also the potential to suggest three-dimensional collapse mechanisms. Its results compared to those obtained with Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) and structural 3D-printed scale models.
