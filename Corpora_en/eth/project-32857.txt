Quadrilateral surface meshing Quadrilateral meshing is widely used in computer graphics and geometric modeling for the generation of high-quality surfaces for animation and product design. In this project, we investigate techniques to create quad meshes from irregular triangle meshes that are the common output of 3D scanning. This research direction is concerned with the automatic generation of high-quality quadrilateral surface meshes for 3D modeling, animation and architectural geometry purposes.
