Reliable timber and innovative wood products for structures Beam-type structural elements made of LVL beech wood The project aims at developing sustainable innovative and reliable timber structures using laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made of beech wood. Timber as natural resource is highly complex due to its anisotropic nature and natural inhomogeneities. The mechanical and physical properties are influenced by duration of load, moisture and temperature. As a consequence, the reliability of structural timber elements is often inadequate and the full potential of timber in the building and construction sector has not been exploited yet. The project aims at developing sustainable innovative and reliable timber structures using laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made of beech wood. This project focuses on the development of beam-type structural elements made of LVL beech wood.
