Laser-spectroscopic studies on surgical smoke Surgical smoke is of concern in surgery - particularly in minimal invasive surgery - applying electrocautery, ultrasonic scalpels and lasers. In close collaboration with the University hospital Zurich, this project aims at analyzing this smoke using infrared laser-based spectroscopic techniques.
