Application of Acetic Acid Bacteria in Food Application of acetic acid bacteria in food Industrial submerged vinegar fermentations are initiated by inoculation with seed vinegar , a microbiologically undefined fermentation broth from previous fermentations. The characterization and classification of A.europaeus by modern taxonomy is a prerequisite for commercial production of defined starter cultures in the vinegar industry. Spontaneous vinegar fermentation will be developed. The use of defined starter cultures would lead from spontaneous fermentations to microbiologically controlled fermentation processes. We keep a collection of about 30 different A. europaeus strains isolated from European industrial vinegar fermenters. These strains are tested for their level of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase expression to identify potent starter strains for the production of vinegar. The tea fungus is an association of yeasts and Acetobacter xylinum fermenting sugared black tea into a slightly alcoholized, acidic, carbonated kombucha beverage. A. xylinum synthesizes a floating cellulose network in which the embedded cells benefit from the close contact to the oxygen containing atmosphere. The preparation of the beverage is obtained by inoculation of black tea containing 70 g sucrose per litre with 10 % kombucha beverage to lower the pH-value and with cellulose pellicles of a tea fungus from a previous fermentation under aerobic conditions. The yeast cells converted sucrose into glucose and fructose by subsequent formation of ethanol and carbon-dioxide. The influence of the fermentation course of glucose and fructose depends on the species of the yeast cells. The pH value of the kombucha beverage decreased during fermentationas a result of acetic acid and gluconic acid formation of the A. xylinum cells (M. Sievers, C. Lanini, A. Weber, U.
