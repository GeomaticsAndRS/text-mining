Fluid-Rock Interaction The likely chemical changes of crustal rocks in the presence of natural fluids are being systematised in various geological settings. One major purpose is to distinguish between fluid-rock interaction involving surface fluids (meteoric), from those involving deep (metamorphic and magmatic) fluids. The chemical signatures of fluid-rock interaction are being used to limit the physics of fossil geothermal, metamorphic and magmatic events.
