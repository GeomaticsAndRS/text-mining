Computing Multi-Particle Production Processes at the LHC With new CERN LHC proton-proton collider, particle physics research enters into a new era of discovery. In the present project, we evaluate hard scattering observables for multi-particle production processes for the LHC, which will provide viable information for the interpetation of future data.
