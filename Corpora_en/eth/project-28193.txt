Decision Making and Optimization in Computational Sustainability Many problems in computational sustainability require decisions under massive uncertainty and partial observability. We show that many such problems satisfy submodularity, which allows us to solve large problems efficiently and near-optimally. We focus on a case study in conservation management. Many problems in computational sustainability require to make decisions under massive uncertainty and partial observability. As an example, consider the problem of protecting endangered species by selecting patches of land to be used for conservation purposes. Typically, the availability of patches changes over time, and recommendations must be made dynamically, based on partial information about the environment. This is a challenging prototypical example of a sequential optimization problem under uncertainty in computational sustainability. Existing techniques do not scale to problems of realistic size. We show that many such problems satisfy submodularity. Exploiting this property allows to obtain efficient approximation algorithms with provable guarantees, as well as drastically speeding up algorithms. We evaluate our approach on a detailed reserve design case study of conservation planning for three rare species in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, in collaboration with ecologists from the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We further use our algorithms for applications in environmental monitoring using mobile sensing devices.
