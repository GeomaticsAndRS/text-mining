Embedded Web Services for Constrained Devices The development of networked embedded systems is costly and does not scale with the software requirements of an Internet of Things. A Web-like application layer and programming model for the constrained devices can remedy the situation by involving developers with different backgrounds. The recent years of research in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have led to the standardization of Internet technology for constrained embedded devices. While consensus was found up to the transport layer to interconnect these devices in an Internet of Things, an open application layer is yet to emerge. This project builds upon the emerging IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which provides RESTful interaction for the most constrained devices (i.e., 8-bit microcontrollers with only a few kilobytes of RAM and ROM). Unlike CoAP, which focuses on machine-to-machine communication, this project concentrates on the human in the loop. It is devoted to design a Weblike application layer with a common programming model. The goal is to enable developers with different backgrounds, including tech-savvy end users, to create software for the numerous, diverse device types from many different vendors found in an Internet of Things.
