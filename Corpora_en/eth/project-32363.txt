Investigating the anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic, anti-apoptotic and anti-senescence properties of Epigallo-catechin gallate (EGCG) in human intervertebral disc cells With this project, we will be able to determine the potential of EGCG for the treatment of disc-related pain. Importantly, this project might have major implications for clinical practice as usage of EGCG may represent the first minimal-invasive intervention for back pain patients.
