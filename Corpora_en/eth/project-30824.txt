Confined masonry Seismur structural wall element The objective of this project is to experimentally investigate the lateral load bearing capacity, the deformation capacity, and the seismic performance of the Stahlton prestressed reinforced concrete wall elements coupled with unreinforced masonry wall elements. The seismic hazard and loading in Switzerland are rather moderate compared to other regions in the. Despite this, most of the lateral force resisting systems in buildings built in Switzerland are reinforced concrete structures. The dominance of the reinforced concrete lateral force resisting systems is caused by the continuous increases of designed earthquake forces and by the unsatisfactory performance of masonry walls exposed to the lateral force actions. As a result, very few newly designed and built structures are pure masonry structures. The concept of confined masonry enables a significant increase of lateral bearing capacity of masonry walls. The company Stahlton Bauteile AG has developed a prefabricated concrete structural element consisting of a concrete core that is cast in with bricks on both wall surfaces, and is prestressed in the factory. The Stahlton Element will be placed on the edges of the lateral force resisting unreinforced masonry wall element and connected to work together with the surrounding floor slabs and masonry infill. A composite masonry-concrete wall element is formed in this way. The design intent is that this element has similar seismic performance characteristics as the cast-inplace reinforced concrete shear wall element. The objectives of this project are to experimentally investigate the lateral load bearing capacity, the deformation capacity, and she seismic performance of the Stahlton wall element coupled with an unreinforced masonry wall element by varying of crucial parameters such as the wall axial load, wall length, wall height etc.
