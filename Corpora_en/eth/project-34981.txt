A Multiscale Hysteretic XFEM Scheme for the Analysis of Composite Structures The aim of the project is to establish a methodology for simulating complex materials, the focus being on reinforced masonry structures. The goal is to achieve an accurate yet computationally efficient methodology for the simulation of dynamic phenomena relating to plasticity and damage.
