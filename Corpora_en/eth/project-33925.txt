Using novel nano-and pheroid-technologies to enhance calcium delivery for food and nutrition applications: production, characterization, and in vivo efficacy Our study aim is to decrease particle size of calcium phosphates and carbonates to the nanoscale to enhance dissolution rates thus improving Calcium absorption. In parallel we will investigate the use of the Pheroid delivery system to improve Ca bioavailability.
