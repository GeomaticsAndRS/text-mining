Vibration-Based Structural Health Monitoring for Wind Turbines The present study focuses on the integration of information coming from various structural elements of WTs, along with stochastic system identification and statistical methods for condition assessment of WTs Even if the mean operational life of modern wind turbine (WT) systems lies presently at almost half of their design period of 20 years, the question of whether their expected life-time could be extended has shortly to be answered. However, the lack of efficient structural healthy monitoring (SHM) methods has not enabled the development of mature and robust tools for the treatment of this problem. The present study focuses on the integration of information coming from various structural elements of WTs, along with stochastic system identification and statistical methods for condition assessment of WTs. A framework able to track degradation, and to detect and localize damage is to be developed, spanning across the various WT structural components, namely the blades and the tower/foundation. Further, factors inducing uncertainties in the simulation, such as the different loading environments, as well as imprecisely known material properties, will be treated via a stochastic approach, in order to enhance the robustness of the developed method. Finally, experimental tests on WT blades (SONKYO Energy) and real WT under normal operation (Repower AG) will be used for the assessment of the proposed framework.
