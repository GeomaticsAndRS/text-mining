Plasma Surface Modification of Fine Powders in the Afterglow of an Atmospheric Pressure Dielectric Barrier Discharge A novel process to treat the surface of fine-grained powders at atmospheric pressure is investigated. The main goal of this project is to perform fundamental research on atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharges and its suitability for changing the powders wettability and flowability.
