The Indian Elites' Languages of Race: Evolution, Eugenics and Race Theories in Colonial India, 1860-1930 The project analyses racialist and racist theories, as well as respective counter-theories, developed by Indian elites during the colonial period, especially 1860-1930. The project explores racialist and racist theories developed by Indian elites during the colonial period, especially between 1860 and 1930. The development of race theories in colonial India was the result of a circular exchange of notions theories explaining human diffeand ideas between the metropole and the colony. SScientific ¸ T rence were a product of European Enlightenment, but they were elaborated and enriched alongside imperial expansion. In this process European interpretations of notions stemming from India were meddled into them. The myth of a supposed SAryan ¸ race", that had migrated to the Subcontinent in ancient times, for instance, is a product of such a reinterpretation. In colonial India, race theories were strategically appropriated and modified by indigenous elites, alongside with social evolutionism and eugenics, resulting in new racialist and racist theories, as well as respective counter-theories, often having a nationalist stance. These theories have not yet been subject to a conjunct study and sufficient critical comparison, a gap this study wishes to fill.
