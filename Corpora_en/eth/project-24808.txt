Fluid chemistry and fluid-rock interaction of Alpine fissure veins, Central Alps This project will investigate the fluid chemistry and fluid-rock interaction processes of Alpine fissure veins, Central Alps (Switzerland). It will contribute to understanding the relative importance and scales of different mass transfer mechanisms in vein formation and metamorphic fluid flow.
