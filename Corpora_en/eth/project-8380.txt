SIndustrial ¸ biocatalysis with new oxygenases in a novel electroenzyme reactorT The objective of this project is to obtain novel functional biocatalysts for regio- and stereoselective oxidation working in a reactor plugged to a wall socket . A central part is the isolation of the responsible part of monooxygenases and the combination with an electrochemical coenzyme regenera
