CNT-based NEMS Nanoscale devices are increasingly being investigated for use in diverse applications such as at togram mass sensing, nanoswitches/memories, force sensing at picoUNewton levels and position sensing using electron field emission. This project focuses on building these types of nanorobotic devices and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). In particular, multiUwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are being investigated for use as electromechanical components of such systems due to their exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. The focus of our efforts are not only on realizing NEMS, but also on building the nanorobotic tools that will be essential to fabricate, assemble and characterize NEMS.
