Large-Scale Nanoelectronic Device Simulation from First-Principles The goal of this project is to develop an efficient massively parallel simulator based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Non-equilibrium GreenSs Function (NEGF) methods that can simulate realistically large nanoelectronic devices with active regions composed of tens of thousands of atoms.
