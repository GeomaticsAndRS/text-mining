Multiple-photon EPR A new kind of magnetic resonance experiments based on the concept of dressed atoms is introduced. The influence of a longitudinal oscillating field on the transition rates in spin systems is under investigation. Theoretical predictions show some interesting features in the dressed spin behaviour. The most important one is that for a certain amplitude of the longitudinal field the system becomes transparent to a probe field. Since multiple-photon transitions with different frequencies are simultaneously excited, these experiments are of practical importance for upgrading old pulse EPR approaches and implement new ones. Currently, we develop methods which make use of these effects to control the excitation profiles in pulse EPR.
