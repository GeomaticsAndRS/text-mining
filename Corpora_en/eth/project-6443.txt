Mechanistic, structural and regulatory aspects of microbial and plant chorismate synthases The mechanism of the last enzymatic step in the shikimate pathway, i. e. the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate to chorismate, is a poorly understood reaction both in terms of the reaction mechanism as well as the puzzling role of the reduced flavin mononucleotide cofactor. The focus of this project is to contribute to the understanding of this reaction and characterize the role of the enzyme active site in catalysis. In order to achieve this goal, we employ time resolved spectroscopic techniques, thermodynamic methods, low- and high resolution structure determination and site-directed mutagenesis of the Escherichia coli chorismate synthase. In contrast to bacterial enzymes, fungal chorismate synthases possess the ability to generate the required reduced FMN at the expense of reduced NADP. This reaction, however, has not been characterized and the structural foundation of this intrinsic NADPH:FMN oxidoreductase activity ("bifunctionality") is unknown. Therefore we are currently designing an overexpression system to obtain sufficient protein material to characterize the chorismate synthase from Neurospora crassa.. In plants, chorismate synthase is a plastidic enzyme. Since chorismate synthase requires reduced FMN, regulation of enzyme activity by means of the redox potential and/or the availability of reduced FMN/reduced NADP can be envisaged. To probe this possible regulatory mechanism, the links between the shikimate pathway and primary metabolism are investigated utilizing hybridization and blotting techniques. This research will also involve the study of regulatory mechanisms of plant chorismate synthase(s) with respect to external factors (light, nutrients, stress) and to possible diurnal rhythms, both at the transcript and protein levels.
