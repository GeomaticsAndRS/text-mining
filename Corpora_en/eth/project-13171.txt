Synos: Virtual Reconstruction of the Proximal Humerus form CT Images of Fragmented Fractures The projects goal is to implement and clinicaly test a virtual reality environment, allowing the surgeon to reconstruct fractured humerus bones using a 3D virtual model. The bone fragments are extracted from CT images of the shoulder and assembled interactively in an immersive VR environment. The ultimate goal during the surgical treatment of shoulder fractures is the precise restoration of the jointSs mobility. This can only be successful, if the original anatomical relationships are reproduced as closely as possible. Precise estimates about the morphology of the bony components are therefore of paramount importance both for reconstructive surgery by ostheosynthesis and for partial or total joint replacement by arthoplasty. Due to the high individual variability and the lateral asymmetry of the shoulder joint, only the proper re-assembly of the fragments provides sufficient information about the original anatomical relationships of a fractured humerus. As such a procedure is an integral part of the pre-operative planning, this reconstruction must be carried out on models of the involved bony components. The goal of the project is therefore the implementation and clinical testing of an experimental virtual reality environment, allowing the surgeon to efficiently perform this task on a 3-dimensional virtual models under clinically viable conditions. The resulting system will allow the interactive identification of the cortical bone fragments from routine CT images of the shoulder and the generation of their 3-dimensional computer models. In a subsequent step these components can be moved around individually in the 3-dimensional space, allowing the reconstruction of the original geometry of the humerus head. This assembly process will be supported by real-time detection of collisions between the fragments, embedded into an intuitive, immersive virtual reality environment.
