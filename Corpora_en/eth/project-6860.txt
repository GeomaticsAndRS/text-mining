Enantioselective Reactions Using Transition Metal Complexes The development of alpha,alpha,alpha',alpha'-tetraaryl-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanols (TADDOLs) as chiral ligands for the preparation of transition metal complexes has been a field of interest for several years. Recently we have synthesized TADDOL-derivatives containing sulfur as coordinating units for the complexation with copper, and we have applied them as catalysts in the 1,4-addition of Grignard reagents. Enantioselective electrophilic heteroatom transfer reactions are also a challenging field. Further investigations are exploring the potential of polystyrene-type resins, crosslinked with dendritically surrounded TADDOLs and other chiral ligands, as well as the different possible applications of TADDOLs immobilized on silica gel.
