Genomic and metabolic investigation of uncultivated symbionts associated with marine sponges Marine sponges are the most prolific marine source of bioactive metabolites. Evidence is accumulating that uncultivated bacteria are the true producers of most of these compounds. The project aims to investigate and utilize these symbionts for sustainable drug development and ecological studies.
