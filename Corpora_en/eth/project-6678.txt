Cluster Analysis and Outliers A Normal mixture model is often used for cluster analysis. However, while the Normal assumption may be adequate for one or more homogeneous. parts of the data, usually not all data points fit to a Normal component. Instead, a contamination model seems to be useful, where a single cluster is modeled as Normal but the rest of the data can be arbitrary, if only well separated from the cluster. Such Normal clusters can be found by iterative reweighted computation of non-outlier regions (fixed point Clusters). The research project centers around fixed point clustering (efficient algorithms and theoretical support). Further, projection methods to show the separation of single Normal clusters from the rest of the data are developed and the robustness of Normal mixture methods against outliers is investigated.
