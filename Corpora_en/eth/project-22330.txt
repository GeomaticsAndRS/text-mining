Robust geostatistical methods for spatial analyses and areal mapping of data in soil protection applications In this project we develop software for robust geostatistical analyses of soil and other spatial environmental data. The software will be implemented in R, and its development will be complemented by geostatistical case studies that should document and illustrate its use for potential users.
