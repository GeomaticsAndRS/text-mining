Genetic animal models of rare copy number variants (CNVs) and their interaction with environmental challenges. This research aims to explore the behavioral phenotypic spectrum of novel mouse models of chromosomal micro-deletions, including mice with 15q13.3 and 22q11 microdeletions, with or without the presence of additional environmental challenges such as prenatal infection or juvenile stress.
