Quantitative determination of silicate melt speciation usign Raman and NMR spectroscopy on rapidly quenched samples The aim is to construct a tool with which the type and abundance of structural entities (species) in two- and three-component silicate melts can be determined quantitatively and to constrain the effect of temperature and composition on the speciation by combining of Raman spectroscopy and NMR.
