Polarisation reversal with magnetic field in Mn2GeO4 Mn2GeO4 is an unusual multiferroic materials, exhibiting both a finite polarisation as well as a magnetisation. Here the strong correlation between electric and magnetic domains under the magnetic-field-induced polarisation reversal is investigated. Magnetic olivine Mn2GeO4 is one of the rare multiferroic materials which exhibit both a spontaneous polarisation as well as a finite magnetisation. Furthermore, there exists a close crosscorrelation between them: With the application of a magnetic field not only the ferromagnetic moment is switched, but the sign of the spontaneous polarisation reverses as well. Here, optical second harmonic generation is used to investigate the ferroelectric domain distribution in Mn2GeO4 and its dependence on applied electric and magnetic fields. The results clearly show that the unusual magnetoelectric effect originates from the direct coupling between mobile ferromagnetic domains and robust polarisation domains. This allows for the hysteretic control of a ferroelectric domain state by means of a magnetic field.
