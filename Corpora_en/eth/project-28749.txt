Temperature Fluctuations in Fluid and Pipe Walls induced by Turbulent Mixing Mixing of fluids with different temperatures result in temperature fluctuations in walls of components of power plants that cause thermal fatigue. The ability of Reynolds Stress Models coupled with a Temperature Fluctuation Transport Model to predict the amplitude of the fluctuations is explored.
