Development of an operating design space for mammalian cell cultivation process parameters Application of QbD concept to create a multidimensional design space for mammalian cell cultivation processes to ensure consistent culture performance and product quality of the produced mAbs. By simultaneously combine several process parameters (e.g. pH, DO, pCO2, hydrodynamic stress) at a time.
