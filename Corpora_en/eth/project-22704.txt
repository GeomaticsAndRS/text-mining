Rheology and the evolution of physical properties with increasing temperature and strain in the illite+quartz system Experimental deformation of muscovite and quartz aggregates to large strains in torsion using an internally heated gas apparatus with torsion capabilities. Measurements of the physical properties of the deformed samples
