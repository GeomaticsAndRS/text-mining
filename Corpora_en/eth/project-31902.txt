Modeling of Urea-Water solution injection for SCR DeNOx system The objectives of this project are to model urea spray, model thermolysis and hydrolysis of urea into NH3 and prediction of NH3 distribution at catalyst entrance. If time permits, this model would be applied to real-life SCR DeNOx systems.
