AudioGraf: A Tool to make Diagrams Readable to Blind Persons Blind persons can understand ("read") a text using a speech synthesizer in a computer. To make diagrams similarly readable more sophisticated devices are needed. In order to display a diagram to blind persons the user interface of a personal computer may be extended by a touch panel as well as acoustic signals and spoken words. AudioGraf is a low-cost tool which allows a blind user to explore a diagram with the help of a touch panel and acoustic feed-back. The goal of the AudioGraf project is to develop a prototype of this tool for ergonomic experiments in order to design a suitable user interface with special extensions. Blind persons are partners in the project for defining and testing this user interface. A simple prototype of AudioGraf is already in use. Usability tests have started to identify ergonomic design rules for user interfaces where blind persons are able to read diagrams.
