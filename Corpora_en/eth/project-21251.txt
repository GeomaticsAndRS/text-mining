4-D Adamello: Petrological and rheological constraints on calc-alkaline batholiths formation (Adamello, Italy) This project combines field, analytical and experimental studies on the phase relations and rheological properties of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks, to obtain constraints on differentiation and emplacement mechanisms of mafic to silicic magmas in the Adamello batholith.
