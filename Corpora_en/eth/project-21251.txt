4-D Adamello: Petrological and rheological constraints on calc-alkaline batholiths formation (Adamello, Italy) This project combines field, analytical and experimental studies on the phase relations and rheological properties of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks, to obtain constraints on differentiation and emplacement mechanisms of mafic to silicic magmas in the Adamello batholith. This project forms the petrologic, geochemical and rheologically oriented research module of the 4-D Adamello ProDoc, and covers the investigation of physical mechanisms that span the range ´ ´ from SductileS intrusive features such as synmagmatic deformation and intraplutonic SductileS ´ contacts, to the SbrittleS emplacement of post-plutonic picrobasaltic to andesitic dikes. We propose to study in detail the phase petrology and geochemistry of deep and intermediate level arc plutonic rocks via a field and experimental approach, to characterize the major phases controlling the chemical evolution of calc-alkaline magmas, and to obtain reliable differentiation models as a function of pressure-temperature-fO2 and fH2O. In particular, we evaluate the potential of H2O saturation during a late stage of crystallization, as a mechanism for separation of highly evolved liquids from their cumulate pile. The principal goals of this project are to systematically investigate and derive physical parameters derived from rigorous field and experimental studies on plutonic and dike rocks. We will decipher experimentally derived fractionation paths and unravel the principal similarities and differences among plutonic rocks and dike systems, with particular emphasis on selected rock suites from Adamello.
