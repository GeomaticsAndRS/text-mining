Non-commutative Geometry and the Physics of space-time Combining ideas that emerged from string theory with Connes' theory of non-commutative geometry, we have developed non-commutative versions of Riemannian and of Kähler geometry. We are applying non-commutative geometry to explore the geometry of non-commutative targets of superconformal field theory. A class of superconformal field theories of central charge c=15 corresponds to classical solutions of string field theory . Our methods serve to reconstruct models of generally non-commutative space-times from such superformal field theories. We are attempting to work out specific examples. We also plan to extend our methods to the theory of D-branes and to matrix models of M theory. Another project concerns the study of supersymmetric field theories on non-commutative space-times. A novel analysis of BRST symmetries in quantum theory has also been started.
