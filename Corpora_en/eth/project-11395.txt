Geodynamics, magmatism, Cu-Au and Pb-Zn metallogeny of the Carpathian-Balkan and the Rhodope orogenic belts Geochronology of the Creaceous magmatic evolution of the ApuseniBanat-Timok-Srednegorie belt, Europe's premier porphyry-Cu-Au province, and timing relation between metamorphic core complex formation and Pb-Zn-mineralisation in the Rhodopes. Structural geology, geochronology and geochemistry is used to unravel the Creaceous magmatic and geodynamic evolution of the Apuseni-Banat-Timok-Srednegorie belt, which is Europe's premier magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry-Cu-Au province. Other questions concern the timing relation between metamorphic core complex formation and Pb-Zn-mineralisation in the Rhodopes. This is a long-term collaboration between Bulgarian, Romanian and more recently Serbian research instritutions, supported by ESF's GEODE Programme, the SNF and tto SCOPES grants
