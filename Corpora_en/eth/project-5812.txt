Behaviour of Microorganisms in Microwave Heated Food Microwave heating of food is a modern convenient cooking method with increasing importance. The speed of the process, however, is counteracted by the inhomogenous heat distribution leading to cold and hot spots within the food. Microorganisms can and do survive in cold spots. In addition, athermic processes have been claimed to lead to poisoned food. Careful experiments with very sensitive genetic systems (Ames-test, UMU-test) which detect cancerogenic and mutagenic chemicals have not provided any evidence for such processes and products in microwave heated food. The microbiological consequences on practice and applications of microwave heating in households and industries are further investigated. Commercially available microwavable food items have been subjected to the prescribed conditions. From the time/temperature profiles, the pasteurization values and corresponding microbiological safety can be evaluated. The main problem turned out to be the inhomogenous spatial distribution of heating in the products. Form these experiment, safety rules for the application of microwave ovens in the household have been proposed. (M. Teuber, O. Guillaume-Gentil, M. Eggmann, S. Calzada and F. Keel.
