Ultra-Fast Charging of Electric Vehicles During the last decades the amount of renewable energy sources like solar energy or wind power and the number of electric vehicles (EVs) grew strongly due to ecological and economical aspects as well as the technological progress in this field. However, the long charging time (more than 30 minutes) and the range limitations of EVs are still challenging problems. Thus the demand on energy storage systems and distributed charging stations increases, which allow long distance journeys and high availability of electric vehicles. These storage systems (depending on the size) are located near highways or in cities as refuel stations and can be sued as grid management systems in the context of smart grid applications. Power electronic interfaces both for a small-scale and a large-scale ultra-fast charging station for EVs are investigated. The focus of the small-scale system is on the power electronics connecting the 400V grid, intermediate battery storage and an interface for EVs enabling ultra-fast charging (<5min, 220kW). The large-scale system connects to the medium voltage grid and integrates a battery energy storage additionally providing load leveling and fast frequency regulation. The integrated solution suits for larger charging stations, e.g. along highways.
