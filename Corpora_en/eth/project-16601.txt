ZENS, The Zurich ENvironmental Study An ESO Large Program to study about 150 galaxy groups to establish how galaxy properties depend on their environment. The Zurich ENvironmental Study uses data for about 2000 galaxies collected through a Large Program at the European Southern Observatory to study galaxy properties as a function of environment. The goal is to understand the physical forcing which galaxies are subject to as they plunge into their dark matter halos.
