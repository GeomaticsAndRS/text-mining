Development of a high sensitivity mass spectrometry source for geological applications In this project, we will develop and optimize a new ion source for thermal ionisation mass spectrometry with superior ionization efficiency and transmission. This project is done in collaboration with CEA (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, France).
