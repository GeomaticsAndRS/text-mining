Statistical Data Analysis, Theoretical Aspects and Implementation Matching scientific questions to be answered by statistical analysis of data on the one hand with statistical methods on the other is commonly perceived as the art of applied statistics. Some efforts have been undertaken two decades ago to formalize strategies of data analysis and identify some theoretical concepts in this area. In view of its importance, the topic deserves much more attention than it presently gets in the statistical community. On a practical level, virtually all statistical software is organized on the basis of functions or menu items that perform a very specific task. Units which are more directly tuned to the needs of practical data analysis should be very helpful in making such analyses more efficient and more reliable and in allowing the user to concentrate on the essential steps. Ideas and S functions are developed in close connection to diverse projects in data analysis and with teaching in the postgraduate course on applied statistics.
