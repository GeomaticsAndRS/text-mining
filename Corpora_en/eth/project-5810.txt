Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria in Food The occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in hospitals is an increasing threat to successful antibiotic therapies. Our interest is the question whether and which foods do contribute to distribution of antibiotic resistant microorganims in the human population. We concentrate on Gram-positive bacteria like enterococci and staphylococci which are common in certain types of fermented food like sausages and cheeses made from raw meat and raw milk, respectively. We have isolated antibiotic resistance genes from Enterococci and Staphylococci and characterized them on a molecular level like TetM, TetK, EryA, Cm 221. In addition, it was found that their traits were localized on mobile genetic elements like plasmids and transposons. Enterococci isolated from cheeses and sausages could transfer their antibiotic resistances in vitro to species of the following genera: Bacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Listeria. The results demonstrate the presence of genetically mobile antibiotic resistance genes in the human (and animal) food chain. These observations demand further epidemiological and molecular investigations to define whether they pose a definite health risk. Recently, antibiotic resistance genes were also discovered in non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria as well as in Gram-negative coliform bacteria isolated from cheese and cheese surfaces. The data imply that antibiotic resistance genes are to be regarded as traits now generally present in microorganisms in food. It must be considered that the human food chain does indeed contribute to the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in the human population. (M. Teuber, V. Perreten and F. Wirsching.
