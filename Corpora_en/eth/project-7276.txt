Integrated Drives Based on Interconnecting Single Function Drives Future production machines require more and more single function drives which cannot be realized with standard drive technology in every case. The high physical requirements can only be met by an integral mechatronic solution. On the other hand, it is necessary to reduce the costs for the highly dynamic drive systems to keep pace with the price trend of production machines. The aim of this project is to show the realizability of single function drives for particular drive problems with weaving machines. A microcontrolled frequency inverter with vector control has been produced. Thanks to a special migration concept, this device can replace several generations of earlier inverters without any adaptation or change of the mechanical components of the drive system. Further investigations will concentrate on direct drives for highly dynamic linear motions. For this purpose, low power linear motors with medium stroke requirements will be designed and compared to conventional drive solutions. To make it possible to use single function drives in production machines, the price of these drives has to be reduced drastically by using new technologies to develop products, which meet the requirements of LCID (Low Cost Industrial Design).
