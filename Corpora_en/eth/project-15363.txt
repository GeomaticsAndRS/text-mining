De-aeration of large conduits The experimental study focuses air pocket movement in horizontal to downward sloping large conduits and the air removal by structural and hydraulic means. Further, the behaviour of the two-phase flow in air chambers and in vertical to inclined de-aeration shafts are investigated.
