Optimization of antifoaming agent mechanism and processing Deaeration mechanisms for gas/air containing suspension sytems are investigated experimentally using specifically developed bubble column and dynamic contact angle measuring devices. The behaviour of particles with different surface properties at gas -liquid interfaces is studied preferencially. Ru
