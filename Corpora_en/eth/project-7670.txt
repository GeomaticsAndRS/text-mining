Nonlinear Viscoelasticity of Rubbers In this project a Butyl rubber with carbon black filler is investigated.This rubber exhibits a particu- larly pronounced nonlinear behaviour even forrelatively small strains. In the experiments cylindrical samples aresubjected to simple torsion. The time range of the experiment is 0-100 s,the ranges of the shear strain and shear rate are 0.0005-0.2 and 0.1-0.85s-1.Prominent feature is the fact that, beyond the linear range (shear strainup to 0.002), the stiffness drops by a factor of about 6, then remainsnearly constant up to shears of 0.2. To account for this type of behaviour,a 3-dimensional non-linear theory was developed on the basis of a rate-typeconstitutive equation. The sharp drop in stiffness observed was accountedfor by assuming a damage and recovery hypothesis. It is assumed that thematerial parameters in the constitutive relation are governed by evolutionequations. Physically this corresponds to the assumption that certain bondsin this type of material are ruptured and reformed at a certainrate depending on the strain level. This theory allows successfulsimulation of the experimental data obtained in the experiment.
