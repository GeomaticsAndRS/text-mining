Protein Import into Chloroplasts Most chloroplast proteins are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized as precursor proteins on cytosolic ribosomes and need to be imported into the organelle. Chloroplast precursor proteins are generally directed to the chloroplast by an N-terminal signal sequence (transit sequence) which is cleaved on arrival in the stroma. The translocation of the proteins across the chloroplast envelope membranes is mediated by translocons located in the outer (Toc-complex) and inner membranes (Tic-complex). The main components of the Toc-complex are the two GTP-binding proteinsToc86 and Toc34, involved in transit sequence recognition, and Toc75, the translocation channel. The best characterized component of the Tic-complex is Tic110, which links import to protein folding. Another component of the Tic-complex, Tic36, has been isolated and is currently being characterized in our laboratory. To this point, most work on chloroplast protein import has been done in pea (Pisum sativum), a plant, which allows easy isolation of functional chloroplasts, of chloroplast membranes and of biochemical amounts of components of the import machinery. The major disadvantage of the pea system, however, is the lack of genetic amenability to the techniques of molecular genetics. In contrast to pea stands Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant in which the development of molecular genetic methods and tools is making rapid progress. The genome of Arabidopsis thaliana is currently being sequenced which allows, in combination with EST-databases, for the rapid identification of Arabidopsis homologues of the known pea Tic and Toc proteins. Indeed, exhaustive searches of the databases have yielded an astounding number of sequences allowing the identification of novel homologues of various Tocs. These and their functions are presently being investigated using molecular, biochemical and immunological techniques.
