Applied Vision Research - Using a PC for Medical Screening of Sensory Function Medical screenings are also important for the health and security of workers at work. Even when using very simple tests, medical screenings are time consuming and expensive. An improvement to this situation can be made by implementing tests used in medical screenings on a PC based system. This rationalisation affects time as well as the amount of apparatus needed for testing. Beside the economic profit, a PC based system improves the validity and reliability of the acquired data due to the more objective working test procedures. In the first step vision tests were implemented on a PC (also available on Macintosh). Among these were tests for acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereo acuity, heterophoria and colour blindness. Tests for hearing and hand-eye coordination will soon follow. The development of test on polyneuropathies has started yet. Validation of the implemented tests are carried out by comparing the results of the tests to results acquired using traditional screening procedures. In order to test the reliability of our PC based screening methods, experiments are to be carried out in the field using approximately 5000 subjects.
