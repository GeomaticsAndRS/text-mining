Development of Chemical Sensors for Oxoanions Oxoanions such as phosphate, nitrate, carbonate, sulfate etc. play an important role in many biological processes. Therefore, an analytical technique, allowing the selective determination of these ions, is required in different fields like clinical chemistry or environmental and food technology. Chemical sensors for oxoanions do not yet fulfill the requirements for practical applications, since their sensitivity, selectivity and lifetime are still not sufficient. In biological systems, however, a number of protein structures interacting selectively with oxoanions is known. The aim of the project is the development of new host compounds (ligands) for phosphate ions, based on the knowledge of the structure and the conformation of the active site of an enzyme (e.g. purine nucleoside phosphorylase). The aminoacid residues which interact with phosphate are considered as being the synthons of the synthetic ligand. The project does not focus on mimicking the enzymatic turnover but rather the recognition principles of the active site. The interaction between analyte and ligand as well as the ligand geometry are modelled by computational methods. The calculations, energy minimizations and simulated annealing procedures using the Sybyl and Amber program packages, are carried out for the free ligand as well as the ligand-ion complexes. Based on the results of these calculations, eight linear and cyclic ligands were prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis. The interactions between the peptide ligands and the oxoanions are first studied based on $^{31}NMR titration experiments. Later, the ligands will be modified for use in polymeric sensor membranes.
