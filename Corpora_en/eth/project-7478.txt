Thermodynamic Properties of Chemically Complex Fluids and Minerals Accurate quantitative descriptions of the chemical stability of minerals and the physico-chemical properties of complex aqueous fluids are essential for successful modeling of ore-forming and other hydrothermal processes in the Earth's crust. Recently, a very accurate thermodynamic model for H2O-NaCl fluids covering the full range of pressure-temperature conditions in the upper crust has been developed by T. Driesner. This model has been implemented in the CSMP++ finite-element finite-volume fluid flow simulation code and applied to diverse magmatic-hydrothermal systems. In parallel, comprehensive thermodynamic models and databases for multicomponent-multiphase fluid-rock equilibria are being developed by T. Wagner. These models are used within the framework of the GEM-Selektor equilibrium solver, and have been applied to the simulation of hydrothermal alteration of granites. We participate actively in the development of the GEM-Selektor code through a collaboration with colleagues from the Paul-Scherrer-Institut (PSI). We are also working on advanced models for the solubility and speciation of gold, copper, aluminum and the rare earth elements in hydrothermal fluids.
