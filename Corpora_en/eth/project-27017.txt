Electronic structure of sub-10 nm colloidal silica nanoparticles measured by in situ photoelectron spectroscopy at the aqueous-solid interface XPS has been extended to colloidal nanoparticles in aq. soln. using a liq. microjet in combination with synchrotron radiation, which allowed for depth-dependent measurements. a˘ Two distinct electronic structures are evident in the Si 2p photoelectron spectrum of 7 nm SiO2 nanoparticles at pH 10. a˘
