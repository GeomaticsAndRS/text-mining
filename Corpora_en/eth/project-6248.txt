AIR DETRAINMENT OF HIGH-SPEED CHUTE FLOWS Detrainment of an air-water mixture flow is important in hydraulic engineering. For high speed flow as occur for instance on spillways, security concepts against cavitation damage have significant relevance. Provided the bottom air concentration of such flow decreases below, say 5 to 8% of air concentration cavitation may cause large scale damage of concrete due to fracturing processes. Given that a spillway is a major safety element for each dam, its loss may cause major structural damage and downstream inundations. It is thus imperative to aerate spillway flows adequately to prevent uncontrolled flow conditions. For spillways with a relatively small bottom slope of about 10 to 30% the detrainment of air is larger than the surface air entrainment, and the air concentration downstream of an aerator decreases. Once it falls below the critical value of 5 to 8% close to the spillway bottom, cavitation protection is lost and the damages previously described occur. A basic knowledge of detrainment will thus be investigated in this research project.
