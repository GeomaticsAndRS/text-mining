Determinants and consequences of excess iodine intake in Eastern Africa The study aim is to evaluate the determinants of excess iodine intake in Eastern Africa and the effects of high iodine status on thyroid function and autoimmunity in school aged-children and women of reproductive age. Background: Universal salt iodization (USI) is the most effective means to assure optimal population iodine status, and the key strategy to prevent and control iodine deficiency. However, high household access to appropriately iodized salt is not yet assured all over the African continent. Excess iodine intake has been documented in some places in Eastern Africa, likely due to excessive salt iodine fortification and poor quality control mechanisms and/or high iodine content of water. The effects of excessive iodine intakes on thyroid function remain uncertain in children and adults. Objectives: The study aim is to evaluate the determinants of excess iodine intake in Eastern Africa and the effects of high iodine status on thyroid function and autoimmunity in school aged-children and women of reproductive age. Methods: This cross-sectional study will be conducted in three local sites with high iodine intakes in Tanzania, Kenya and Somalia. At each of the three study sites, iodine status (urinary iodine concentration in spot samples) and thyroid function (thyroid hormone and thyroid antibody concentrations on dried blood spots) will be assessed in 400 school-aged children and their mothers. Salt, water and milk samples will be collected in the households and the iodine content will be measured. A questionnaire will be used to assess the dietary intake of iodized salt and foods rich in native iodine.
