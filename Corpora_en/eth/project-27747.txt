EU-CSP2 Concentrated Solar Power in Particles The use of concentrated solar power (CSP) is an important step to cover rising energy needs while at the same time reducing CO2 emissions. To produce electricity on a competitive basis the efficiency and safety of CSP plants have to be improved. A limiting factor of existing CSP plants is the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The aim of the CSP2 Project is to use a dense gas-particle suspension as an alternative HTF that allows working temperatures higher than 550 C. The solid phase consists of any particulate mineral, like quartz sand, that withstands high temperatures. The solid particles can also be used as a thermal energy storage medium due to their high heat capacity. Compared to standard HTFs, the particulate solid material is widely available, inert, and has high heat resistance. It has advantages regarding environmental impact, safety concerns, and CSP plant efficiency. Large quantities of the particles can be produced at low cost without any chemical process development.
