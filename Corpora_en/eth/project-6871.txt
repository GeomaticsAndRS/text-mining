Development of new methods in solid-state NMR: Dipolar recoupling under fast MAS by adiabatic methods Fast rotation of the sample around the magic angle (MAS) in combination with strong decoupling significantly improves the 13C spectral resolution of uniformly enriched samples. Because high resolution is a prerequisite for structural investigations of large biological molecules with solid-state NMR techniques, we are interested in the development of methods which can be used under high-speed spinning. High-speed MAS offers many advantages for solid-state NMR experiments. The most important point is the increase in resolution of otherwise unresolved spectral lines containing many resonances. However, the high MAS speeds which are possible today ( >69 kHz ) also average out very efficiently interactions which contain valuable spatial information. Recoupling of one of these interactions, the dipolar interaction, is the main focus of one of our research interests. The method we employ uses amplitude-modulated rf fields for adiabatic polarisation transfer between dipolar-coupled spins. This method has the advantage that it is efficient while at the same time being tolerant to experimental parameters and it is applied as a mixing sequence in homonuclear 2D correlation spectroscopy.
