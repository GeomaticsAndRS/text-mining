Design of Traffic Lanes at Intersections The aim of the project is to provide a basis for the revision of the Swiss standard to design intersection elements, which draws on the experience of the 1960's. The study is concerned with traffic lanes at intersections which can be used in common by different types of traffic or different vehicles. The study will concentrate on the follow-ing aspects: evaluation of new knowledge from technical literature in Switzerland and abroad; studies of deceleration behavior on widened road sections ahead of the intersections and on preselection lanes in order to check the assumptions made in the current standard. Recording and evaluation of lane widths within the intersection area and their assessment with regard to ease of use and channelling effect; preparation of recommendations for the revision of the standard.
