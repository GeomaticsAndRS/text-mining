Integrating Ecosystem Function into River Quality Assessment and Management (RIVFUNCTION) The project aims at developing a methodology for assessing the functional component of ecological river quality status (functional ecosystem integrity). This goal will be achieved by determining the performance of a key ecosystem-level process (litter decomposition) in response to two types of serious and widespread anthropogenic impacts on rivers. Field experiments on the effects of excessive nutrient loading (eutrophication) and modification of riparian vegetation are carried out at 60 paired sites in ten Ecoregions throughout Europe. These investigations are complemented by controlled experiments aiming at a mechanistic understanding of process alterations. In addition, a comprehensive literature survey will be conducted to synthesise available information on anthropogenic effects on river functioning. Further, a methodology for assessing functional river integrity will be developed based on this broad synthesis. Its developmental steps include the identification of a suitable set of indicators and their critical thresholds, and definition of the technical specifications of standardised procedures. The tool will be elaborated by a mixed consortium of environmental scientists and end-user representatives to ensure both a sound scientific foundation and practicability.
