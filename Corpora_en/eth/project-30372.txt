Design of hierarchical zeolites for the synthesis of 4S4S-MDA In this project, we aim to design hierarchical zeolite acid catalysts for the production of 4S4S- methylenedianiline from aniline and formaldehyde in order to increase the activity and selectivity to a level that allows zeolites to compete with HCl, the established homogeneous acid catalyst. The synthesis of methylenedianiline is a key step in the production of raw materials for hard polyurethane foams. Industrially, this process is catalyzed by a homogeneous acid catalyst, namely HCl. Due to the required neutralization/separation of this catalyst that causes costs for NaOH and wastewater treatment, there is a large incentive for a heterogeneous catalyst. Although active in the reaction, zeolites were however not able to compete due to limited activity and stability In a first phase of this collaboration project, hierarchical zeolites are prepared at ETH Zurich and tested in the reaction by Bayer MaterialScience in Dormagen. Promising zeolites are investigated in more detail to develop structure-functionality relationships between catalytic performance and material properties like Brønsted and Lewis- acidity, external surface area and pore size, followed by continuous experiments to assess stability and finally the preparation of shaped catalyst particles.
