Shear induced micro - structuring of water continuous frozen multiphase food systems close to glass transition temperature The formation of disperse ice crystals in frozen food systems under mechanical shear treat- ment close to glass transition temperature of the continuous watery sugar/polysaccharides containing phase is studied. Microstructure formation, related ice crystal suspension rheology and the impact of mecha
