The relation between swelling pressure and strain of anhydritic rocks We investigate by means of long-term laboratory tests the swelling strain vs. pressure relationship of anhydritic rocks. This relationship is very important for the conceptual design of underground structures but even qualitatively unknown for rocks containing anhydrite. The swelling strain vs. pressure relationship is of paramount importance for the conceptual design of underground structures. For anhydritic rocks it is unknown (even qualitatively), how the final value of the swelling pressure is related to the deformation. Systematic long-term observations are scarcely available. The extremely long duration of the swelling process, taking several years even under laboratory conditions at the scale of rock specimens, makes systematic investigations very difficult. The ongoing long-term experimental program will deliver information about the time development of the swelling process and in particular about the influence of pressure on the swelling strain. The project includes the development and construction of a new robust and reliable swelling testing device. The influence of external factors on the test as adjustment of loads, long-term accuracy of measurement, stiffness of the testing device or temperature should be eliminated or minimized. With this new testing apparatus and with samples from the Gypsum-Keuper, series of swelling tests under different axial loads should be performed. The duration of each test is estimated up to 10 years.
