Characterization of human UPF1 helicase functions in replication fork progression and genome stability To map the genomic locations of UPF1 DNA binding sites as well as of ´ DNA damage sites induced by UPF1 depletion using SChip-on-chipS approaches and to characterize human UPF1-associated functions in replication fork progression and genome stability.
