General EPR simulation algorithms General and flexible simulation algorithms for cw EPR, ENDOR and pulse ESEEM spectra are being developed. Theoretical work is being done on the development of a very general accumulation scheme for disordered systems, on the efficient computation of cw EPR resonance fields, on the extension of ESEEM simulations to systems including high g anisotropy and significant zero-field splittings and to high-spin systems, and on an adaptive method to reduce the time cost for pulse EPR computations. The resulting algorithms are implemented in the form of a package for MATLAB, a commercial numerical computation software. The package includes spin operator and spin Hamiltonian construction, powder and single-crystal EPR and ENDOR simulations, routines for pulse EPR simulations as well as many tools for data analysis.
