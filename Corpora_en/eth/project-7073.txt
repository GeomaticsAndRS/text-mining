It's main concerns are: - A systematical description and analysis of all available material that can be used as testimony for the constitution of a critical text, comprising witnesses such as - Chinese and Japanese printed editions of the Lunyu - Chinese and Japanese collections of variant readings - The various stone classics from different ages - Tang manuscripts from Dunhuang and Gaochang (near Turfan) in Central Asia - A manuscript form the Western Han found in Dingxian, Hebei - Quotations and allusions in Han- and pre-Han-litterature - The establishment of a textual history based on the analysis of the interrelationship between the various witnesses, and not solely on the study of historical sources - The description and analysis of common textual variations - The establishment of a set of rules to cope with textual corruption and to decide between variant readings - A critical reconsideration of the methods and fallacies involved in grammatical and exegetical analysis of transmitted ancient Chinese litterature, if it is unconcious of textual corruption
