Man Machine Interaction - Interface Design: All4u - Dynamic Collaborative Information Spaces The goal of this interdisciplinary project is the development of a tool for navigation, organization and orientation in the personal information space of a user. Students and researchers use a large pallet of applications on a daily basis to get organized, and to access and administrate information. The actual situation requires the user to find his way on his own within the information space spanned by a variety of channels. The means at their disposition are very limited and require a huge effort from the user's side (e.g. bookmarks, email, but also search engines). In our project, we aim at giving advises how the different components of the personal information space have to look like and what kind of services are required in what form. To accomplish this aim, we base our work on user studies and prototype implementations.
