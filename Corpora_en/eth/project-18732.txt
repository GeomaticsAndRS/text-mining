Indicator-Based Multiobjective Search in High-Dimensional Spaces The aim of this project is to gain a basic understanding on the structure of many-objective optimization problems and to develop methods for coping with high-dimensional search spaces like dimensionality reduction methods, indicator-based algorithms and the visualization of high-dimensional data. The existence of high dimensional search spaces is a usual problem in multiobjective optimization. For example, decision making is difficult with high-dimensional search spaces yielding a vast quantity of information, namely many decision variables, many alternatives, and many objective values where the visualization of these high-dimensional data is only one related problem. Furthermore, the search for good solutions in large search spaces is also difficult and can cause immense computational costs. This project addresses both the decision making and the optimization with respect to theoretical and practical investigations. On the one hand, we aim at gaining a basic understanding of problem structures and answering the question why high-dimensional problems are hard to tackle. Therefore, a fundamental investigation on the dominance structure for multiobjective problems together with running time analyses of simple evolutionary algorithms are necessary. On the other hand, we focus on dimensionality reduction methods and new indicator-based evolutionary algorithms to cope with high-dimensional problems in practice.
