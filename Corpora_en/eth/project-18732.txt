Indicator-Based Multiobjective Search in High-Dimensional Spaces The aim of this project is to gain a basic understanding on the structure of many-objective optimization problems and to develop methods for coping with high-dimensional search spaces like dimensionality reduction methods, indicator-based algorithms and the visualization of high-dimensional data.
