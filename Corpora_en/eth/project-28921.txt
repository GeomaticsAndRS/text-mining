Hydrology, Vegetation and Herbivore interactions in a disturbed floodplain in Zambia The key objective of this PhD project is to understand how the construction of large dams have affected the wetland vegetation and herbivore food supply in the Kafue Flats, an extensive seasonally inundated floodplain system, by altering hydrological and nutrient conditions. This PhD project is part of the African Dams Project (ADAPT) formed by an interdisciplinary group of researchers. ADAPT aims at enhancing the scientific basis of integrated water resource management (IWRM) by developing new models that can be used to improve the operation of existing large hydraulic structures and in better designing future schemes. The key objective of this PhD project is to understand how the construction of large dams have affected the wetland vegetation and herbivore food supply in the Kafue Flats, an extensive seasonally inundated floodplain system, by altering hydrological and nutrient conditions. We hypothesize that the changes in hydrology induced changes in vegetation (including invasion of N-fixing shrubs) and affect the population of the endemic Kafue Lechwe through a reduction of the extent of important feeding habitats. The project is divided in three main parts: First we will link patterns of plant species occurrence to hydrological conditions, based on historical vegetation recordings, and new re-recordings at the same sites. Second, we will map temporal trends in shrub encroachment (both native shrubs, and the exotic Mimosa pigra) from satellite images and study the causes and underlying processes as well as the effect on plant diversity by means of a detailed field study. Third, we will study the temporal change in the population of Kafue Lechwe in relation to its diet composition, and temporal changes of its food supply.
