Structure and function relationships in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferases UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (EPT) and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSP-synthase), the only known enolpyruvyl transferases, catalyse important steps in two biosynthetic pathways, i.e. the cell wall component peptidoglycan and the shikimate pathway leading to aromatic amino acids, respectively. The enzymes are the targets of the herbicide glyphosate (EPSP-synthase) and the antibiotic fosfomycin (EPT), respectively. The two enzymes share an unusual three-dimensional structure and the mechanism of action was demonstrated to proceed through the same type of reaction intermediate. Based on the known three-dimensional structure of EPT, we are employing site-directed mutagenesis to replace individual amino acid residues thought to be involved in catalysis, binding of the substrate(s) and/or protein conformational changes. In conjunction to the mutagenesis study, we probe the active site of EPT with UDP-sugar derivatives designed to be substrate or transition state analogs. The three-dimensional structure of the mutant proteins and the complexes of EPT with UDP-sugar derivatives are solved by X-ray crystallography. This approach yields a detailed understanding of the role of the studied amino acids in the catalytic processes and provides the basis for a rational design of useful EPT (and possibly EPSP-synthase) inhibitors. This research effort is currently expanded by the overexpression and purification of two other variants of EPT from Mycobacteria and Chlamydia which exhibit a different substrate specificity and amino acid composition of their active sites resulting in fosfomycin resistance. In addition to molecular biological tools mentioned above, we are also utilizing thermodynamic (microcalorimetry) and kinetic (rapid quench flow and fluorometry) methods to characterize the properties of wild-type and mutant enzymes.
