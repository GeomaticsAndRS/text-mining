The American Conception of Neutrality 1941-1970 This study represents an update of a professorial dissertation (Habilitation) originally published with Macmillan in 1988. Its purpose is to determine the American conception of neutrality once the United States itself abandoned neutrality in 1941. The first version of the study covered the period up to 1955. With the availabiliy of new documents it is now possible to rewrite the chapter on the end of World War II (Eizenstadt Report, Bergier Gold Report), to complete the chapter on the Austrian State Treaty and to cover Indochina (Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia).
