Methane formation and anaerobic methane oxidation in archaea: Investigation of the catalytic role of the nickel hydrocorphinate F430 in solution and as a prosthetic group in the enzyme. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which coenzyme F430 catalyzes the last step of biological methane formation and in archaea. We study the reactivity of the hydroporphinoid nickel complex F430 as a model for its role in the key enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reduct
