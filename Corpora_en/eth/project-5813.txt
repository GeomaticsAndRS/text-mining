Molecular Taxonomy and Applied Genetics of Bacterial Cultures in the Biotechnology of FoodFermentations The project intends to close gaps in our basic scientific knowledge regarding specific bacterial ripening and starter cultures for typical Swiss products like cheeses and raw meat sausages (Emmental, Tilsit, Appenzeller, Salsiz, Landjäger). The investigation will concentrate on 3 topics: a) Construction of a molecular identification system for bacterial starter and ripening cultures belonging to the Actinomyces branch of bacterial evolution including Brevibacterium, Micrococcus, Microbacterium, Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium on the basis of colony hybridization with gene probes. b) Study of horizontal gene transfer in vitro and in vivo between strains and species of the Actinomyces and Clostridium branches, including naturally present antibiotic resistance genes and broad host range transmissible plasmids and/or transposon which we recently isolated and characterized from fermented food in Switzerland and abroad. c) Development of the applied genetics of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria with specific attention to biochemical reactions important for food fermentation. The overall emphasis is on improvement of technological performance of the cultures in the industry and on all aspects of safety of these cultures for human consumption.
