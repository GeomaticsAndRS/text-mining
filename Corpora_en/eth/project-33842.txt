Induced multipolar order in magnetoelectrics The linear magnetoelectric effect couples magnetic and electric excitations within a material. By using MaxwellSs equations we explore how this coupling can cause a monopolar magnetic field if a charge is placed in inside or in the vicinity of a magnetoelectric.
