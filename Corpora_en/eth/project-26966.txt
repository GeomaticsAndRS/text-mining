Strongly correlated photons in cavity systems We study the quantum statistical physics and mesoscopic properties of strongly correlated photons in driven open cavity systems We investigate the quantum statistical and mesoscopic properties of (strongly correlated) photons in open and driven cavity systems. A nonlinearity, typically an atom or a quit, leads to the interaction (dressing) of photons in a cavity, resulting in polariton states. This qubit-cavity system is described by the Jaynes-Cummings model, an array thereof by the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model. The latter exhibits a quantum phase transition between a Mott-insulating and a superfluid phase which we have studied within an equilibrium setting (phase diagram and excitations). Including drive and dissipation, we have studied the nonequilibrium delocalization-localization transition of photons in a cavity dimer. Recent work includes a study of the dispersive photon blockade in a cavity QED setup and the dressing of dressed states in strongly driven systems.
