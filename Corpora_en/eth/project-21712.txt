Modelling the growth and impact of wood decay fungi The white-rot wood decay fungi Physisporinus vitreus preferentially degrade the pit membranes in wood whereby the fungi increases the wood permeability. The project models hyphal growth and expansion of P. vitreus in heartwood of Norway spruce in collaboration with Prof. Schwarze from EMPA.
