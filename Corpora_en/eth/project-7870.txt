High-Speed Low-Loss InP Space Switch Matrix Fully Packaged with Electronic Drivers andSingle-Mode Fibers High-performance switching modules have to be compatible with standard single mode fibers (SMF) and electrical interfaces for practical use as components in high-speed optical communication systems. We developed, fabricated and packaged several 4x4 InP switch matrices completely with electronic high-speed drivers and precision aligned single-mode fibers. The 4x4 switch modules are based on four polarization-independent 2x2 Mach-Zehnder type switches (as described above). Efforts to achieve fiber to fiber losses of the fully packaged module below 10 dB include a low loss waveguide design with integrated mode shape adapters, the use of lensed fibers and our high precision self-aligned flip-chip mounting technique. High-speed switching response of less than 200 ps with on-off ratios of over 17 dB has been obtained with optimized waveguide electrodes and high-speed drivers based on InP heterostructure bipolar transistors.
