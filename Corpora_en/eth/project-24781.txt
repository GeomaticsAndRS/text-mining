Synthesis of P-functionlalized Metal-Organic Frameworks The production of anchoring group in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential to post-functionalize these materials with transition metals. P-functionalized MOFs are still not known in the literature although phosphorous is one of the most employed donor atom for catalysis by metal complexes.
