The Minimal Cell Project This is a development of the previously described work on the autopoietic self-reproduction of vesicles. In order to have a closer model of a living cell, one should have not only the replication of the boundary (the shell), but also the self-replication of genetic material, for example RNA, inside the shell. In other words, one should realize a shell-and-core replication. To this aim, we have developed a system consisting of self-reproductive oleate vesicles containing the enzyme Qb replicase, which is able to replicate a RNA template while the oleate vesicles self-reproduce. Dr. Thomas Oberholzer is supervising this project, as well as one in which the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is investigated in oleate vesicles and POPOC liposomes.
