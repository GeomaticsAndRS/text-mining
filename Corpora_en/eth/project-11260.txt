Generation and photoelectron spectroscopy of cold radical samples In this project we seek to generate samples of highly reactive species (such as O3 ) and free radicals (such as CH2 , NH2 , C5 H5 , CH3 , ...) in the gas phase for studies by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy. The detection of electrons forces us to work at low background pressures (typically 10-7 mbar), and the desire to mimic the physical conditions in the upper atmosphere and in molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (collision free environment, low temperatures in the range 10-50 K) requires the use of supersonic gas jets. We have recently developed a powerful technique to generate radicals in cold supersonic gas jets based on the photolysis of suitable precursor molecules in the high pressure region of the supersonic expansion. We are studying the photoionization dynamics of the radicals and the spectroscopic and dynamical properties of the corresponding singly-charged cations by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy.
