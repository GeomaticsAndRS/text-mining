Building-energy relevant climate characteristics The development of http://www.bph.hbt.arch.ethz.ch/ClimateSurfs/climate-surfaces\rh demonstrated the reducibility of the thermal characterisation of a room to only three parameters and the possibility to visualise the energetic relevant properties by a climate-surface. With these parameters the free-run-temperature as the most relevant thermal characteristic of a room can be computed from climate data. The design temperatures for heating and cooling have thus been given as function of these parameters and therefore the influence of solar radiation and thermal inertia considered explicitly. The climate surfaces are traced back to three relevant parameters allowing the energy relevant characterisation of any kind of climate. The goal: The representation of the energy relevant part of climate data in a most informative and concentrated form. A globally valid characterization of climates relevant for the energy need. This goal has been attained and the project has been completed with the PhD Thesis No 14010, The relevant climate characteristics for the energy need of a room . The existence of a common, universal relationship which governs the thermal interaction of a room with the local climata everywhere in the world has been proven, and a practical planing instrument ("XY-representation") has been elaborated.
