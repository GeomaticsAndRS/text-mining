Comparative and molecular approach to the identification of polymorphisms in genes associated with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) in the pig The main objectives of the proposed project are to (1) map the AMC phenotype to the swine genome using microsatellite markers, (2) scan porcine candidate genes for differences between AMC/AMC (normal) and amc/amc (diseased pigs).
