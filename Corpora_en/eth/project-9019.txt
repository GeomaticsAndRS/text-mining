Comparative and molecular approach to the identification of polymorphisms in genes associated with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) in the pig The main objectives of the proposed project are to (1) map the AMC phenotype to the swine genome using microsatellite markers, (2) scan porcine candidate genes for differences between AMC/AMC (normal) and amc/amc (diseased pigs). The main objectives of the proposed project are to (1) map the AMC phenotype to the swine genome using microsatellite markers, (2) scan porcine candidate genes for differences between AMC/AMC (normal) and amc/amc (diseased pigs). Anticipated detection of differences will provide clues to the causal factor of AMC disease in the pig and potentially in other species and (3) develop a genetic test to screen boars used in artificial insemination. Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), defined as permanent joint contractures present at birth, may affect joints, ligaments, skeletal muscle, central and peripheral nervous tissue, or a combination of any of them. It is one of the most commonly encountered congenital defects in piglets and other mammals. Etiologic factors implicated in piglets, which do not survive after birth, may be genetic factors, nutritional deficiencies, toxic plants, pharmacologic and viral agents and unknown causes. In our case the disease was shown to be controlled by a single autosomal recessive allele designated by the gene symbol amc. At the moment, at least 15 AI (artificial insemination) boars (about 25% of the total population) are known to be carriers of the illness and cause considerable economic losses in the Swiss pork production industry.
