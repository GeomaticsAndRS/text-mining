Aluminum redistribution during the preparation of hierarchical zeolites by desilication Understanding the evolution of the aluminum speciation and related aci- dity during the preparation of hierarchical zeolites is of vital importance for the rational design of improved catalysts. In this work we apply 27Al MAS and 27Al MQMAS NMR spectroscopy and the IR study of adsorbed pyridine to fol Hierarchically-structured zeolites often display distinct acidic properties from their conventional analogues. This work investigates the impact of mesoporosity introduction by alkali-mediated desilication on the aluminum speciation and related acidity of ZSM-5, USY, and beta zeolites. The stepwise property evolution is followed by 27Al MAS and 27Al MQMAS NMR spectroscopy and the IR study of adsorbed pyridine. Whereas only tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum is evidenced upon treatment in aqueous NaOH and sequential ion exchange with NH4NO3, significant redistribution is observed upon calcination, the extent of which increases with the degree of mesoporosity. Comparatively, the alkaline-treated zeolite can be directly brought into protonic form without altering the aluminum speciation by exchange with a mineral acid, yielding a material with a higher Brønsted acid site density and enhanced performance in the isopropylation of toluene. However, calcination of the latter zeolite induces a similar redistribution of aluminum to that observed upon thermal treatment of hierarchical NH4-ZSM-5, confirming the reduced thermal stability of a certain fraction of acid sites. The outcome will emphasises the importance of controlling or even eliminating the calcination step in the preparation of hierarchical zeolites.
