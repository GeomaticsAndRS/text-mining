Nonlinear Optical and Electro-optic Effects in Organic Crystals The large second-order optical nonlinearities of organic materials make them useful for many potential applications in nonlinear optics. These materials offer many possibilities to tailor-make substances with the desired properties through optimizing the microscopic hyperpolarizabilities (molecular engineering) and the orientation of the molecules in the crystalline material (crystal engineering). We are characterizing organic single crystals for their nonlinear optical and electro-optic properties. The large birefringence and the strong dispersion of the refractive indices allow for many phase-matching conditions required for large conversion efficiencies for e.g. frequency-doubling and optic parametric oscillation. Electro-optic effects in organic materials are of almost purely electronic origin and are therefore interesting for fast electro-optic applications. The most interesting materials investigated so far include single crystals of 4-(2-(1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-pyridylidene)-ethylidene)-cyclo-hexa-2,5-dien-1-one methyl 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (Mero-MDB),4'-dimethylamino-N-methyl-4-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST), and 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde-4-nitrophenyl-hydrazone (DANPH). Further investigations will aim at finding optimized organic materials with respect to their nonlinear optical properties and exploiting their possibilities for applications.
