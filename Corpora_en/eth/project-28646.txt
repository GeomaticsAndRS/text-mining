GNSS Instrumentation in the Valais (COGEAR) The permanet GNSS network (AGNES) has three sites located in the canton Valais. In order to obtain a better coverage in the Valais area new permanent GNSS sites have been installed. This new sites will allow to observe the deformation within the covered area. Since 1998 the Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo) has established its new national first order GPS based Reference Network LV95 (Landesvermessung 95), and for that purpose built up an Automated GNSS Network for Switzerland (AGNES). The network consists of 30 stations which cover the whole country and are operating continuously. Three of the permanent stations are located in the canton Valais (MART, HOHT, ZERM, see Figure 1). In order to obtain a better coverage in the Valais area new permanent GNSS sites have been installed by the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab (GGL) in the frame of project TECVAL and COGEAR. If possible GNSS sites were co-located with other sensors installed in the course of the COGEAR-project such as seismic stations, meteorological sensors, displacement sensors etc. The obtained GNSS data is integrated in the GNSS national network and is processed by swisstopo (Brockmann, swisstopo) using Bernese GNSS software (Dach, 2007). For velocity estimation with reasonable accuracy the observations need to be recorded for several years to precisely determine and reduce seasonal effects and increase the reliability of the obtained results (Hollenstein et al., 2008). If velocities from all sites are available local deformation will be better constrained and more significant comparisons with focal mechanisms (Kastrup, 2007) can be envisaged.
