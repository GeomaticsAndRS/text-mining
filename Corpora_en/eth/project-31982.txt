Assessing rock mass response to hydraulic injection through in-situ experiment in deep mine Hydraulic injection tests accompanied by an extensive characterisation with multi-parameters monitoring of the injected regions are conducted to improve our understanding of the processes at play. The group of Engineering Geology is contributing to the design and the execution of the experiments.
