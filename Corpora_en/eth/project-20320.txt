Systems behavior of vesicles constituting clathin- and caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis By means of astrophysics software various patterns of endocytic vesicles generated by large-scale RNAi in human tissue culture cells are quantified and classified. The various simulatable pattern classes will be used as input for a Brownian Agent mathematical model to describe the vesicles' behavior
