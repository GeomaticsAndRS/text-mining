Fire behaviour of cross-laminated solid timber panels Objective of the research project is the development of a calculation model for the fire resistance of cross-laminated solid timber panels taking into account the behaviour of the bonding adhesive at high temperature. Cross-laminated solid timber panels represent an interesting technical and economical product for modern timber structures. The use of large prefab-ricated cross-laminated solid timber panels for load-bearing wall and floor assemblies has become increasingly popular in particular for residential timber buildings. Fire tests on cross-laminated solid timber panels showed that the fire behaviour of cross-laminated solid timber panels depends on the behaviour of the single layers. If the charred layers fall off, an increased charring rate needs to be taken into account. The same effect is observed for initially protected timber members after the fire protection has fallen off. Thus the fire behaviour of cross-laminated solid timber panels can be strongly influenced by the thickness and the number of layers. Further, the position of the panel (horizon-tal for slabs, vertical for walls) as well as the be-haviour of the bonding adhesive at high tempera-ture can influence the falling of the charred layers and thus play an important role in the evaluation of the fire behaviour of crosslaminated solid timber panels. Objective of the research project is the experimen-tal and numerical analysis of the fire behaviour of cross-laminated solid timber panels. The influence of several parameters (thickness and number of layers, bonding adhesive used, joint configuration) on charring of cross-laminated solid timber panels will be studied with a series of fire tests. The re-sults of the fire tests in addition to numerical calcu-lations will permit the development of a calcula-tion model for the fire resistance of cross-laminated solid timber panels.
