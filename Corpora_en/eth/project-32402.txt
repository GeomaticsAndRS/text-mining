Automatic pre-processing/analysis/information extraction from big sensor data by advanced signal processing The research project has the objective to survey the state of the art on advanced processing algorithms, architectures and circuits for high-resolution and high-bandwidth sensors. Sgeneralized ¸ imagingT The focus of the project is on intelligent processing, i.e. image understanding which entails much more than digital image enhancement, and includes is automatic detection of changes, anomalies, objects and/or people in a dynamic context. In addition to advanced dynamic feature extraction, intelligent processing includes extraction of high-level information, and pre-analysis to facilitate interaction with human operators. This includes semantic highlighting, textual annotation, collection of relevant meta-data (e.g. target velocity). The goals of this project are (1) to survey the state of the art on advanced algorithms, architectures and circuits for image sensors and intelligent vision systems; (2) to provide analysis and technical evaluation with insights on the various approaches, their advantages and disadvantages; (3) to identify major trends in hardware plat-forms and algorithms, (4) to prioritize strategic and promising technologies.
