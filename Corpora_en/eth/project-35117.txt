Plant-mediated interactions among beneficial and pathogenic microbes: implications for disease transmission and ecology This project will determine reciprocal fitness consequences for beneficial root bacteria and a pathogenic virus interacting via a shared host plant (Medicago truncatula) and elucidate mechanisms by which microbes alter plant chemical phenotype, vector behavior and interactions with natural enemies.
