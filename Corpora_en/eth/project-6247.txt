Survey and prevention of extreme glaciological hazards in European countries The main goal of this project is to develop scientific studies for detection, survey and prevention of future glacial disasters in order to save human lives and to reduce damages. The first objective is to set up a comprehensive inventory of the past catastrophic events related to the glacial environment. A second ojective is to analyse the relevant physical processes of each type of glacial hazards. The following three types are considered: 1. glacier floods: they have the highest potential of damage and have the most far reaching impact. Floods are triggered by outbursts of lakes on glaciers or beside them and from water pockets within glaciers. While glacial lakes can be easily recognised, water pockets are not yet identifiable. 2. ice avalanches: they form when a large ice mass breacks off from a glacier and falls down a slope to break into smaller pieces of ice. the breaking off mechanism will be analysed in detail to improve forcasting of ice avalanches. 3. glacier length variations: when glaciers are advancing or retreating, important parts of their tongues may be destabilised or may cause glacier floods if the ice creates a temporary dam An improved scientific knowledge of glacial risks is necessary to make available guidlines for detection, prevention and mitigation of glacial risks.
