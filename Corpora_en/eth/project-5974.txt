Heat and moisture transfer in fractal structures The goal: Model description of porous material structures by fractals. Investigation of adsorption in fractal structures by means of the equilibrium statistical mechanics Results: The adsorption process is studied on a 3D model substance obtained by truncation of an exact fractal, the Menger Sponge. It is assumed that the molecules adsorbed on the internal surface of the fractal interact only with their nearest neighbours (of the adsorbed as well as the surface molecules of the solid, respectively). Due to the presence of various pore sizes the molecules may occupy adsorption sites with a variety of potential energies. On this reason the fractal model is a much more realistic approach to describe the surface heterogeneity and steric difficulties in real materials than the commonly used model of the slit or cilindrical pores. The saturation of the Menger Sponge has been studied for different values of the cohesion to adhesion ratio at low temperatures (i.e. through states of minimal energy, by neglecting the thermal fluctuations). It has been found that when the cohesion is very small compared to adhesion, the whole surface of the fractal When, however, the cohesion exceeds the half strength will be covered first by a S3D ¸ monolayerT. of the adhesion, a porewise saturation of the fractal starting with the smallest pores takes place. In the next steps of the project the high temperature case will be investigated by using the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo method of statistical mechanics.
