Materials Science with Ion Beams MeV Ion beam techniques are developed and applied for the characteriza- tion and modification of thin layers and surfaces. For the characterization of the elemental composition of thin layers and surfaces several ion beam based methods are applied and continuously extended and improved: Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS), Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA), Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA), and Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE). All these methods are fully quantitative and can detect all elements throughout the periodic table (including hydrogen). Sensitivities vary from a few percent down to ppm. The accessible depth is on the order of a micron. The depth resolution of elemental concentration profiles is a few nm. For improved mass and depth resolution a Heavy Ion Rutherford Backscattering System (HIRBS) with a time-of-flight (TOF) spectrometer is used. Properties of monocrystalline materials (defect densities, epitaxial layer orientation, strain, lattice sites, etc.) can be studied with a depth resolution of a few nm with a 5-axis channeling goniometer. MeV Ion Beam Analysis is routinely applied to a large variety of problems including III/V-compound multilayer systems, metal silicide epitaxy, optical coatings, process contamination control and defect profiles in implanted semiconductors. As a unique tool for low level trace element analysis an Accelerator-SIMS facility has been set up. It allows to analyse trace elements at the ppb level and below. This system is able of raster scanning with a lateral resolution of 3 ¸ tm. Depth profiling has a resolution of better than 10 nm. For modification of material surfaces (irradiation, implantation) a large variety of ion species and energies are available. A wide range of implantation conditions (temperature, orientation, raster scanning) can be chosen.
