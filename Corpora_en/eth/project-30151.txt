Modeling deviations of distances in short-range terrestrial laserscanning We develop methods for the assessment of systematic deviations of terrestrial laser scanners associated with the scanner-to-object distance and the reflectivity of the object surface. The goal is to predict the accuracy of point clouds realistically based on prior experimental results. Terrestrial laserscanners are able to measure the distance between the scanner and the reflecting surfaces with millimeter level precision. However, the measurement values are contaminated by both random and systematic deviations. The former can be mitigated using filters. However, optimum filter design requires the stochastic properties of the random deviations to be known, and proper quantification of the entire measurement uncertainty requires also a sound understanding of the systematic deviations and their likely magnitudes. Within this project we investigate experimentally the deviations of terrestrial laserscanners for distances up to 30 m and aim at developing models for the quantification of both random and systematic deviations. The study is based on measurements under laboratory conditions with planar targets of various materials which are moved in a stop-and-go mode along a horizontal rail. High accuracy reference data are obtained using a laser Doppler interferometer. Particular attention is paid to the dependence of the deviations on target reflectivity, target material and target distance. The results of this project will help to better exploit the accuracy potential of terrestrial laserscanning in particular for deformation monitoring of buildings, landslides and rockfalls and for conformity assessment.
