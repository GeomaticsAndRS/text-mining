Large-scale Anthropogenic Effects on Ecosystem Processes: Litter Decomposition andAssociated Microbial Productivity in Littoral Wetlands The project addresses the effects of two major large-scale environmental changes (temperature increases and sustained nitrogen deposition) on critical ecosystem-level processes. The strength of the resulting effects is tested by means of manipulative field experiments in a littoral wetland dominated by the cosmopolitan, highly productive emergent macrophyte, Phragmites australis. The primary processes considered include litter decomposition, nutrient i mmobilization by decomposing litter, microbial respiration (= carbon mineralization), and fungal and bacterial secondary production. Two experiments are carried out. In Experiment 1, littoral enclosures will be heated to temperatures above ambient water temperatures, and rates of the above ecosystem processes will be determined. Experiment 2 addresses the effects of increased nitrogen availability, both as a single factor and in combination with increased temperature and phopsphorus availability. The results of these experiments are expected to lead to a significantly improved understanding of the mechanisms regulating litter decomposition and associated microbial processes, and to facilitate predictions about the effects of global change scenarios on heterotrophic carbon flows in wetlands.
