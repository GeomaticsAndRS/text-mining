Supported CeO2 catalysts for selective three-phase hydrogenation of functionalized alkynes We have recently discovered the outstanding catalytic properties of CeO2 as a selective catalyst for gas-phase partial hydrogenation of acetylene and propyne. In this work, we have explored the performance of this intriguing material for the three-phase hydrogenation of functionalized acetylenics. TiO2-, Al2O3-, and ZrO2-supported CeO2 catalysts with different Ce loadings were prepared by wet impregnation of the carriers with an acidified solution of cerium ammonium nitrate. The calcined catalysts were characterized by bulk and surface-sensitive techniques, which included microcalorimetry, and evaluated in the three-phase hydrogenation of alkynes under continuous-flow conditions at variable temperature (293U413 K) and pressure (1U90 bar). A number of acetylenic compounds, which contain terminal or internal triple bonds, conjugated unsaturations, and additional functionalities, were systematically assessed. The results revealed the full stereo- and chemoselective character of the ceria catalysts, which outperform the well-known Lindlar catalyst, and open promising perspectives for the revolutionary use of a cost-effective oxide for the production of olefinic compounds in the vitamin and fine chemical industries.
