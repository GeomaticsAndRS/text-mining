Formation of nanowires by means of microfluidics Formation of anisotropic structures by means of microfluidics Formation of micro- and nanostructures by means of microfluidics and construction of nanowirebased sensing devices. Anisotropic structures (wires, fibres, tubules) with diameters ranging from a few tens of nanometers up to a few micrometers made of metals/organic ligands are formed at the interfaces of two co-flowing streams. Microfluidic tools to form and immobilize the structures are developed and optimized. Furthermore, the implementation of the (conductive) nanowires into a miniaturized sensing device will be evaluated in the context of this project. Methods: Microfluidic chip design and fabrication, implementation of electrode patterns, conductivity measurements, electron microscopy
