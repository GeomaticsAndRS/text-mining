Man Machine Interaction - Interface Design: Touch-ability of Touch-screens Touch screens have the potential to solve a number of problems concerning applicability and user-friendliness of computer interfaces. These advantages especially are visible from the point of view of implementation. For example, for the designer they have the advantage that there are no physical limitations on the interface, other than the size of the screen. From application point of view they have the advantage that technical implementation is kept at a minimum, only a screen is needed. The aim of this project is to investigate in a systematic way the factors that influence the perceived touch-ability of buttons. Results show that, although in most judgments of surfaces confirm the know properties of the surface, this is not always the case. The qualities perceived by user may differ from the known qualities, based on which the designer created the interface.
