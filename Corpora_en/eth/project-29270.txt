Population genomics of adaptation in the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola Modern agriculture relies on effective crop protection to ensure food security. Crop pathogens pose a significant challenge as they can rapidly adapt to new resistant crop varieties and fungicides. Our project will illuminate key characteristics of the rapidly evolving genome of a major pathogen.
