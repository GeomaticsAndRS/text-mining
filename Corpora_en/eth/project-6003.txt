CAPRI Capital Market Processes and Regional Innovation Systems The international capital market changes substantially and gains more control over innovation processes and location decisions and therefore influences the regional development. Particularly at the interaction between capital market and the regional innovation system processes and decision making between banks, financial intermediaries and enterprises might have changed due to the stronger influence of the shareholder value. This context will be analysed in the CAPRI project ("Capital market processes and regional innovation system") by taking the European metropolitan region of Zurich as an example. The CAPRI project encompasses two PhD dissertations and two Master theses.
