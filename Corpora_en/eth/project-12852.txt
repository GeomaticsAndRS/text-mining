High resolution EPR spectroscopic investigations of a homologous set of d9 valence electron configurated organometallics Stable mononuclear open shell organometallics are still comparatively unexplored and this is especially true to the late transition metals from the periods 5 and 6. A strictly homologous set (Co, Rh, and Ir) of d9 valence electron configured organometallic complexes are under investigation using solution and solid state EPR. Up till now we have studied the combination tropp- plus-phosphine , which allowed the synthesis of genuine Rh(0) and Ir(0) complexes, and the combination trop-plusdiazabutadiene , which allowed the synthesis of the first water-stable neutral rhodium and iridium complexes with a 16+1 electron configuration. The application of modern pulse techniques have helped to understand the remarkably different structural, electronic and dynamic properties of these novel species when compared to their d8 and d10 counterparts.
