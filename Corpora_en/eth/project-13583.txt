Discovery and synthetic application of bacterial alcohol dehydrogenases for enantioselective reduction of carbonyl groups This project deals with the identification of new enzymes with high and complementary enantioselectivities for the reduction of ketones and the development of practical bioprocess with these enzymes for the production of enantiopure alcohols that are useful and valuable pharmaceutical intermediates
