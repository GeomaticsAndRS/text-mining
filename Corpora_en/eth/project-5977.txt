AFM investigation of the formation of water layers on internal surfaces of porous building materials The goal: To understand the interaction of water with the internal surface of the cement matrix on the molecular level and to develop appropriate models. Results: 1) With the mica-replication-method (MRM), thin layers of Ca(OH)2 with smooth surfaces were prepared from the hydration of cement paste. Its real time carbonation process was systematically monitored by the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). It has been found that the carbonation due to the presence of the CO2 content of the ambient air takes place only if the relative humidity (RH) exceeds 26%. 2) The reaction of calcite (CaCO3) crystal with concentrated solution of water glass (Na2SiO3) gives rise to a calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) layer on the surface of calcite. 3) The polishing of the produced C-S-H layer by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) results in a very flat surface with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of RMS=0.19nm, as being determined by AFM measurements. 4) With the aid of Scanning Polarization Force Microscope (SPFM) the formation of a water bilayer on the surface of mica was observed (Fig.3). Further SPFM studies on the C-S-H surface is being pursued to provide insight in understanding the water adsorption and transport process.
