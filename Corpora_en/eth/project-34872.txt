An integrated approach to the mechanism of HBr and HCl oxidation over rutile-type catalysts We study mechanistic similarities and differences of the oxidation of HBr and HCl to the corresponding halogens and water over rutile-structured catalysts (i.e. RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2). Compared to the advances in the HCl oxidation, there is only limited knowledge on the related HBr oxidation. The reaction is a promising route to recover bromine from methane functionalization processes, where bromine activates methane in form of methyl bromide, which is subsequently converted into olefins and higher hydrocarbons. Hydrogen bromide is formed as a by-product in both reaction steps. Deacon catalysts, e.g. RuO2, IrO2, and CeO2, catalyze the oxidation of HBr to Br2 at lower temperatures compared to HCl, with RuO2 being the most active in both reactions. The most interesting finding to this point is the unexpected HBr oxidation activity of rutile TiO2, albeit its inertness in HCl oxidation. First principle DFT calculations shed light on the effects that lead to the self-activation of TiO2. However, an overall mechanistic understanding of HBr oxidation to aid the rational catalyst design is still missing as well as a clear differentiation between HCl and HBr oxidation mechanisms. Thus, comprehensive investigations of the surface chemistry of these complex reactions are highly desirable. Herein, we investigate the oxidation of HBr in detail over rutile catalysts, that is, RuO2, IrO2, and TiO2, by application of molecular modeling, transient, and steady-state experiments. We discuss the mechanistic differences between these catalysts in HBr oxidation, as well as the dissimilarities between HBr and HCl oxidation over RuO2. The experimental results are complemented by DFT calculations, which determine the structure sensitivity of HBr oxidation reaction path over rutile-type catalysts and the high-energy demand for the bulk bromination.
