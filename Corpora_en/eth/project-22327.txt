Preference Articulation, Hybrid Optimization, and Interactive Decision Support The project focuses on interactive search methods for multiobjective optimization in the context of design space exploration in engineering design. Mathematical modeling and optimization is often carried out in an iterative process where both model and algorithm are progressively refined until a satisfactory solution has been found. Such refinements are based on preference information and domain knowledge which may vary for each user and application. Therefore, optimization methods need to be flexible in this respect and at the same time allow model and preference modifications during run-time; however, current techniques are not designed for flexible and interactive preference articulation. The anticipated results of this project can be summarized as follows: (i) a methodology for formalizing user preferences such that the resulting model can be easily used for optimization; (ii) randomized search algorithms that allow to integrate arbitrary user preferences and guide the optimization process with regard to these preferences; (iii) hybridization schemes that allow to integrate complementary operations research techniques and problem-specific strategies such as branch-and-bound and dynamic programming into global search; (iv) concepts for dynamic preference adaptation.
