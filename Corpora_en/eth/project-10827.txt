Classes proved correct This project investigates uncompromising techniques aimed at ensuring the correctness of a particular kind of components, classes of an object-oriented library, using full mathematical proofs, supported by automatic proof tools. The aim is to develop proof techniques for object-oriented components, or classes; the techniques must in particular cover the semantics of reference (pointer) manipulation.
