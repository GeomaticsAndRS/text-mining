Advanced Querying of Multimedia Information ETH World will contain many different multimedia documents like, for example, course material (video, slides, exercises), web documents, research papers and related presentations, databases about projects, rooms, staff and students, and digital libraries (books, videos, images). Due to the enormous amount of data, the members of ETH World require efficient and effective search mechanisms for finding the right information. Todays search engines like Google, AltaVista, or FastSearch only offer keyword based search. Obviously, this search metaphor is limited to textual documents and requires carefully chosen keywords. The aim of this project is to provide much more sophisticated search tools: we want to enable users to search for any multimedia content like text documents, images, or videos. We further want to take the context of the users as well as the context of the documents explicitly into account. Finally, the query interface should be simple yet powerful enough to express information needs of the ETH World users. We want to incorporate newer search metaphors like query by example or relevance feedback into the future search engine of ETH World. But we also want to design new methods to express the information need, to enter queries, and to (automatically) organize the information space.
