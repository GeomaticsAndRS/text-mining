Geodynamics of the Eastern Mediterranean (GEODEM) GPS-Measurements are being evaluated to closer determine the kinematic field in the Eastern Mediterranean. Emphasis is also placed to improve and develop models describing the strain rate field in this region and to interpret the results in terms of geodynamic processes.
