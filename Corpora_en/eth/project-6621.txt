Jacobi-Algorithm for Computing the SVD Jacobi algorithms compute the eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices or singular values of general matrices with nearly the highest attainable relative accuracy. In particular, the so-called one-sided (implicit) versions of Jacobi algorithms are very well suited for parallel implementation. We implement a one-sided block Jacobi method on the Intel Paragon. Using asynchronous communication between processors it is possible to almost completely overlap communication with computation, and thus obtain near-optimal speedups. Our implementation of the Jacobi algorithm ishighly attractive in the cases when: (1) a large number of processors is available; (2) high relative accuracy is desired; (3) the symmetric matrix is almost diagonal or the general matrix is almost orthogonal in which cases the Jacobi method converges very quickly.
