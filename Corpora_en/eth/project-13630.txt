EURYI Project: Molecules in Magnetized Solar and Stellar Atmospheres Molecules are found in a large variety of astronomical objects, ranging from comets in the solar system to galaxies at high red shifts and including the Sun and cool stars. We develop the theory of molecular magnetic interactions and diagnostic tools, and establish a new field in astrophysics.
