High performance, low-power carbon nanotube gas sensors This project focuses on the development of ultra-low power, suspended carbon nanotube gas sensors. The work is directed towards the development of improved device architecture as well as the characterization of the short and long-term performance of the gas sensors. Our goal is to develop a gas sensing platform that is suitable for future integration into tiny, autonomous gas sensor nodes. We focus on developing an appropriate transducer technology for such nodes using individual carbon nanotubes, because traditional gas sensing technologies dissipate substantial power, or are too bulky for mobile applications. Carbon nanotubes have shown great potential for ultra-low power gas sensors, since they are gas-sensitive at ambient temperature. We address several open questions in enabling the application of self-heated, low-power gas sensors using our technology, including the optimization of the self-heating power, long-term reliability and drift studies, and cross-sensitivity studies. Furthermore, the device architecture will be further improved in order to improve its suitability for CMOS sensor interfaces, by enabling lowvoltage drive and readout. The feasibility of self-heated recovery in atmospheres containing the target gas as well as high humidity levels will also be tested.
