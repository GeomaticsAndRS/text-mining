Spatial and temporal regulation of the yeast APC-related protein Kar9 during mitosis The yeast Kar9 protein is highly similar to the human tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli. We showed that Kar9 is loaded onto microtubules at spindle poles. The mechanism of loading and its regulation by the cell cycle control machinery are under investigation.
