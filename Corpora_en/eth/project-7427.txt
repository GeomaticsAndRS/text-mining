STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A general objective of statistical experimental design is to maximize the subsurface information that can be derived from a geophysical survey. Data from a well-conceived survey should provide model resolution that approaches the limit allowed by the physics of the method. Since model resolution is quantifiable via linearized inversion theory, identification of optimum survey layouts can be formulated as an optimization problem that is solvable using global optimizing schemes, such as genetic algorithms. In practice, to optimize survey recording parameters it is necessary to consider recording geometry, source locations, dynamic range of the instruments, logistics, acceptable data variance, etc. We are investigating methods that will eventually allow optimum survey designs and parameters to be determined quantitatively.
