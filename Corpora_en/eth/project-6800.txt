Biodegradable Polymers for Medical Occlusion Therapy There exist several medical procedures that depend on occlusion of specific organs and, hence, on materials suitable for occlusion. It is desirable to have substances that form solutions of low viscosity in non-toxic solvents and that form visco-elastic materials upon mixture with bodily fluids. Experiments have also shown that for some such occlusion materials, X-ray opaque materials may be advantageous. We use a newly developed, high-x-ray-contrast monomer (diatrizoic acid-mono-glyceryl ester) as a comonomer in the synthesis of biocompatible, biodegradable copolymers that satisfy the above mentioned conditions and degrade after a suitable time in vivo to components that are non-toxic and can be excreted by natural pathways.
