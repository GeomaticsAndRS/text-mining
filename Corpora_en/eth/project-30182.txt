Context Sensitive Information: Robust Optimization by Information Theoretic Regularization In this project, we study possible approaches to address an uncertainty in the data provided for optimization (continuous and combinatorial) problems. Under this uncertainty, we reformulate the informativeness-robustness trade-off in terms of information theory and regularize the cost function.
