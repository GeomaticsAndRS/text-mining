Epidemiology of age-related bone loss and fractures Because bone mineral density alone fails to capture key components of bone strength in osteoporosis, and therefore incompletely characterizes fracture risk, this project is now assessing bone structure and composition utilizing new cutting-edge technologies. The project complements human studies of osteoporosis pathophysiology by addressing fractures, the principle clinical manifestation of osteoporosis. A series of retrospective (historical) cohort studies will be conducted to estimate the long-term risk of age-related fractures associated with secondary osteoporosis. Secondary osteoporosis is an important area of research because there are therapies for affected men and older women who are not candidates for estrogen treatment. Here it is proposed to extend this work by quantifying the fracture risk associated with conditions that might reflect altered sex steroid levels in older women and men where each condition represents a natural experiment with respect to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis. Our overall goal is to develop new information including novel imaging and quantification schemes that will lead to effective strategies for preventing osteoporosis-related fractures among the elderly.
