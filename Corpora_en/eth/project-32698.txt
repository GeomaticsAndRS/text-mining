Negative ions: the overlooked species in thin films groth by pulsed laser deposition The role of negatively charged diatomic species on the oxygen Content of thin films deposited by pulsed laser Ablation is investigated. A combination of mass spectrometry/emission spectroscopy is used to obtain complementary information about the plume composition.
