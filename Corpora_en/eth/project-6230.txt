Porous Asphalt - Monitoring of Performance under Traffic and Long TermAchievement Particularly on motorways, porous asphalt pavements, that is to say pavements with a highly porous surface course, offer advantages in reference to traffic safety and noise. Owing to good surface drainage, these pavements reduce the risk of aquaplaning and the formation of water splash. In addition, the surface layer's acoustical properties are comparatively favourable: under certain conditions, they produce a relatively low rolling tire noise and can also bring about resonant absorption. These pavements however are confronted with certain disadvantages such as problems of winter maintenance, the ageing of the binder component, reduced longevity, high demands on aggregates and application. The performance of these special pavements is being examined at various test sites under real conditions. In addition, laboratory tests are carried out periodically. Important criteria are skid resistance, permeability, deformation behavior, acoustical properties, ageing of the binder component, durability, winter performance and maintenance problems.
