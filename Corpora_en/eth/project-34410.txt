Beech wood concrete hybrid structures The project aims at developing hybrid structures by combining beech wood and concrete in smart construction processes. The developed techniques will enable to fulfil specific performance criteria and to strongly support the objective of an increased sustainability in construction. The project part aims at developing hybrid structures by combining beech wood and concrete in smart construction processes. The developed techniques will enable to fulfil specific performance criteria and to strongly support the objective of an increased sustainability in construction. Specific focus will be on wood concrete hybrid floor assemblies using beech laminated veneer lumber. The main static performance requirements are high strength and stiffness, ductility and robustness accompanied by a high flame retardancy. Further, the wood concrete floor assemblies should act as two-way slabs. The following main tasks are planned: - To define the performance requirements for beech wood concrete hybrid structural elements. - To quantify the importance and incertitude of model- and material-related parameters being decisive for the design of beech wood concrete hybrid structural elements. - To develop reliable, efficient and economic bonding for composite action between natural and mineralized LVL beech wood and different concrete solutions without using steel fasteners. - To perform an extensive experimental investigation and numerical parametric study using the finite element approach for the accurate and reliable characterisation of the structural behaviour of beech wood concrete hybrid structural elements. - To develop accurate, safe and economic advanced calculation models for the design of beech wood concrete hybrid structural elements.
