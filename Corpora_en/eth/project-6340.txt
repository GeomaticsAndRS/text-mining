Systems Ergonomics - MEDINO: a tool and a database to manage and disseminate users' knowledge in work system processes. MEDINO means Management, Ergonomics and Design Information for Organisations. The aim of this project is the design of a database to collect and exchange user's knowledge about work system processes. The knowledge basis are results from the transcription of user interviews of operating room facilities in Switzerland, Belgium and in the United States. Over 500 statements are already stored in a mind-map structured method. The database allows the management of the statements via Internet. Obviously the knowledge database can help designers, engineers and architects in the planning and optimisation of operating room facilities. But more effective, the database helps to make the organisational knowledge potential more transparent. Further development of the MEDINO-System is to integrate infomations about the need and flows of information in complex work systems.
