Matrix metalloproteinase degradomics at the epidermal-dermal interface Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate processes within the dermal dermal interface. In this proand the epidermal compartments and particularly at the epidermal U ject, we use novel quantitative proteomics techniques to unravel the mechanisms of MMP action in the skin.
