Eat to learn to move We aim to manipulate the rewarding value of specific types of food through neurofeedback. The effectiveness of the manipulation will be assessed through an adapted food frequency questionnaire. We will train healthy young, food-deprived subjects to self-regulate the mesolimbic dopaminergic system.
