Relativistic Theories of Extended Objects Relativistic theories of extended objects can be defined by requiring the space time volume swept out in Minkowskispace to be extremal. The resulting equations of motion for the time dependent shape of such an M-dimensional object constitute a highly non-trivial set of coupled non-linear partial differential equations, once M is greater 1. The following (partially completed, partially planed) programs are important: - find explicit solutions (study their properties, stability, ...) - establish characteristic features of the dynamics (depending on the topology, periodicity, singularities, ...) - make use of various non-trivial reformulations of the equations, e.g. as Euler equations of a compressible isentropic irrotational inviscid K'arm'an-Tsien gas - try to obtain (non-local) conserved quantities (e.g., by introducing a spectral parameter in the recently found linear system) - consider the question of integrability (especially for axially symmetric membranes) - consider the quantization of such theories, e.g. in the form of matrix models - investigate the question of zero energy states in the corresponding supersymmetric matrix models
