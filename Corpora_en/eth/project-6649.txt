Biologically Inspired Optimization: From Fish Propulsion to Aeroacoustics For centuries, engineers have sought inspiration from nature in devising their creations. We are interested not only in developing systems based on natural creations (biomimetics) but also in developing algorithms for the systematic optimisation of engineering problems. We are developing optimisation strategies based on evolutionary behaviour of biological systems ranging in scales from bacterial chemotaxis to social human organisations. Our goal is to develop evolutionary algorithms depleted to the extend possible of ad-hoc heuristics, by adopting biological concepts of processes such as mutation, fitness and selection. These methods are being applied on technically relevant optimisation problems such as jet mixing in fluid mecahnics, turbine blade design, and the design of micromixing devices. The robustness and portability of these approaches enable the development of optimisation tools not only in a simulated environment but also in real world applications in an experimental and industrial set-up. In a particular project we collaborate with Alsthom Technologies to implement Evolution Strategies in a Pareto optimisation of a turbine design. While in design our goals is the reduction of emissions and pulsation, on the algorithmic level our emphasis is on improving performance on exploration and exploitation capabilities of these techniques. Present research involves: (i) the development of meta-optimmisation techniques based on concepts such as population dynamics and self-organisation of optimisation parameters (ii) the application of evolutionary concepts to the study and design of systems emerging in fluid (life in moving fluids) (iii) the development of hybrid optimisation techniques combining gradient algorithms, evolution strategies and reinforcement learning. (iv) the investigation of optimality in biological organisms such as fish hydrodynamics
