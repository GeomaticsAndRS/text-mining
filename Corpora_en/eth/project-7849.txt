Integrated Optics in Ferroelectric Potassium Niobate The perovskite potassium niobate (KNbO$_{3}$) exhibits very interesting electro-optical, nonlinear optical and photorefractive properties which make this material promising for active devices in optical data processing. We fabricate optical waveguides in KNbO$_{3}$by means of ion implantation, reactive ion etching and sputtering, respectively. A prism coupling setup is available which allows to investigate and characterize the waveguides by ATIRS (attenuated total internal reflection spectroscopy) or darkline spectroscopy. A computer code was developed to reconstruct the detailed waveguide profile from the mode spectrum. A setup to measure the propagation losses of the optical waveguides at different visible and near-infrared wavelengths was constructed. Our work concentrates on the waveguide fabrication technology and the investigation of the nonlinear optical and photorefractive properties of the waveguides. Prototypes of modulators and optical frequency converters have been fabricated. Experiments are in progress towards the developement of a photorefractive beam-steering device and a self-pumped phase-conjugating mirror operating in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range.
