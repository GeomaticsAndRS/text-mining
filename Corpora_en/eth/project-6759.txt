Pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectisations of 3-dimensional contact manifolds A joint research project with H. Hofer and K. Wysocki aims at a theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectisations of 3-dimensional contact manifolds. It is related to dynamical systems defined by Reeb vector-fields, low dimensional topology, symplectic and contact geometry and partial differential equations of Cauchy-Riemann type. A Fredholm theory for pseudo-holomorphic curves combined with an asymptotic analysis of finite energy planes and a bubbling off analysis leads to a dynamical characterization of the tight 3-sphere. The theory can be used to establish unknotted periodic orbits on contact 3-spheres constructs open book decompositions and global surfaces of section on special 3-manifolds. Surfaces of sections are a classical tool in the study of 3-dimensional dynamical systems. Surfaces of section of disk type do exist, for example, on every strictly convex and compact energy surface of a Hamiltonian system in the 4-dimensional standard space. As a consequence these energy surfaces carry always either precisely 2 or infinitely many periodic orbits. Generalizing the concept of surfaces of section one constructs in the complement of finitely many distinguished periodic orbits on generic tight 3-spheres a finite energy foliation transversal to the Reeb flow. The applications cover non degenerate Hamiltonian systems restricted to starlike energy surfaces.
