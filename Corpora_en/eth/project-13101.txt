Herschel Space Observatory, hardware, software, science We produced the Qualification and Flight Models of the cryogenic frontend including some microwave electronics (amplifiers) for HIFI, the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared on the Herschel Space Observatory. We are currently working on the software development and prepare for observations. We produce the Qualification and Flight Models of the cryogenic front-end including some microwave electronics (amplifiers) for HIFI, the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared. The instrument will be one of three that are planed to operate in the focal plane of the Herschel satellite, the forth cornerstone of the European Space Agency. Launch is planed for 2007. Our contribution is the Common Optics Assembly (COA) and Mixer Subassemblies (MSA), including the Diplexer Housings, constituting the first section of the seven-channel receiver in the frequency range between 480GHz and 1.9THz. The two components (COA and MSAs) represent the optical parts in the focal plane unit. The components are designed in cooperation with SRON in Groningen, the Netherlands, by TPD in Delft and manufactured by HTS in Wallisellen. They are followed by the intermediate frequency IF2-Box, designed and developed by the Microwave Electronics Laboratory at ETH, and manufactured by Contraves. The noise of the HIFI front-end is mostly produced by the amplifiers and determines the overall sensitivity for observations. In view of the unprecedented high spectral resolution, receiver noise is the limiting factor for HIFI science. Spectral resolution of line shapes is essential to model the flows of molecules in star forming regions, stellar accretion disks and in many of the other proposed HIFI projects. The project is in its Phase C and D and continues on schedule.
