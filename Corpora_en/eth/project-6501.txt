Optimization of extensive forest inventories The introduction of sampling techniques has greatly rationalized the collection of information. However, further increase in efficiency is needed, particularly with respect to the complexity of the questions addressed and the resulting costs. Therefore, the development of optional sampling schemes is a key issue for the planning of forest inventories, whether one attempts to minimize the costs for a given error or conversely. The present work investigates modern tools of sampling theory in the special context of forest inventory. The concept of anticipated variance allows to construct optimal two-phase two-stage cluster sampling schemes. The theory is validated with data form the first and second Swiss National Inventory.
