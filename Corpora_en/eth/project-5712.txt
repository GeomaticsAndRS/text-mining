Sustainable Land Use and Forestry Production in the Greifensee Watershed Area: Core Project The Core Project is a central element of the Greifensee project whose main objective is the development of concepts for sustainable agricultural and forestry land use in the Swiss Midlands and the of the respective policy measures for their implementation. The results of disciplinary projects (so-called specific projects) are integrated in the Core Project. A land use model is developed. Model calculations are carried out to obtain the optimal land use strategies and the policy measures for their promotion. Indicators are employed to operationalise land use sustainability. The evaluation of the sustainability of the land use scenarios under investigation is based on a comparison of the indicator values arising from the optimisation with the threshold values defined by the specific projects. A comparison of the actual with the desired land use situations reveals the utilisation conflicts associated with landscape as a public good. In addition to its scientific function, the Core Project also serves as an instrument which formalises communication between the specific projects and the Core Project. Furthermore, the Core Project is responsible for communicating with third parties and interested institutions.
