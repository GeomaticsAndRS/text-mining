Micro/macro Methods in Flow Calculations of Complex Fluids In countless industrial processes, fluids of complex microscopic or mesoscopic structure, like polymer solutions and melts, liquid crystals, colloidal dispersions, ferroelectric fluids, electrorheological suspensions, etc. are subjected to complicated processing flows in which they exhibit a non-Newtonian response which is a functional of the entire flow history. The size of the particles that form the fluid can range from molecular to macroscopic scale. Ideally, the flow behavior of such complex fluids in engineering applications should be predictable from the underlying particulate or molecular picture. This requires an understanding of the functional stress-strain relationship for a given fluid structure. In classical numerical calculations of flows, the strain-history-dependent stresses of complex fluids are obtained from analytical constitutive equations. In micro/macro methods, continuum-mechanical discretization techniques (such as Finite Elements or Spectral-Collocation) are directly combined with micro- or mesoscopic particle dynamics (Molecular Dynamics, Brownian Dynamics) thus obviating the need of a constitutive equation. In this way, the model particles directly carry out the work of computing the stresses in numerical flow calculations, much as real particles or molecules do in a laboratory experiment or in an industrial process. This approach opens up new ways to the fluid dynamics of hitherto intractable complex fluids. Current work involves extensions to non-isothermal flows, to general transport phenomena and the implementation of micro/macro methods on massively parallel computer architectures.
