Efficient calculation of relative conformational free energies in complex biomolecular systems: Further development of the ball-and-stick local elevation umbrella sampling (BS-LEUS) method In 2010, we proposed a new method, ball-and-stick local elevation umbrella sampling (B&SLEUS), to enhance the sampling in computer simulations of (bio)molecular systems. This approach enables the calculation of converged free-energy differences between conformational states even in situations where the definition of these states relies on a large number of variables. The B&SLEUS method consists of the following steps: (A) choice of a reduced conformational subspace; (B) representation of the relevant states by means of spheres (Sballs"), ¸ each associated with a radial memory-based biasing potential and a radial confinement term; (C) definition of a set of lines (Ssticks") ¸ connecting these spheres, each associated with a longitudinal memory-based biasing potential and a transverse confinement term; (D) unification of the individual biasing potentials (active subspace) by exponential averaging; (E) build-up of the memory using the local elevation (LE) procedure, leading to a biasing potential enabling a nearly uniform sampling (radially within the spheres, longitudinally within the lines) of the active subspace; (F) generation of a biased ensemble of configurations using this preoptimized biasing potential, following an umbrella sampling (US) approach; (G) calculation of the relative free energies of the states via reweighting and state assignment. This approach presents unique features such as: (i) a problem-adapted geometry (a priori specification of the states); (iii) a high level of interconnection (many transitions between the states); (iii) a minimal irrelevant volume (limited sampling outside the states); (iv) a low internal dimensionality (acceptable memory requirements). In the present project, we will further develop the B&S-LEUS scheme. In terms of methodology, two new biasing-potential building blocks will be introduced to complement the spheres and lines: (i) the segmented-pipe, to enable curvilinear enterconnection pathways between the states (useful when linear pathways present dramatic energy barriers, potentially leading to numerical unstabilities); (ii) the hollow-tube, to enable transitions between disordered states (i.e. characterized by different distributions of a specific single-molecule coordinate, rather than by coordinate deviations from a single reference configuration). In terms of applications, we will use the B&S-LEUS scheme (complemented by the two new building blocks) to tackle increasingly challenging problems: (i)secondary-structure transitions in peptides and proteins; (ii) helical-form interconversions in doublestranded ligonucleotides; (iii) calcium-mediated chain-chain association in polyuronates; (iv) phase transitions in lipid bilayers.
