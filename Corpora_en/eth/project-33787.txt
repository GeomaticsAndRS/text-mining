Treeline dynamics in the Swiss Alps: combining dendroecological reconstructions of relict treelines with projections from a forest succession model The objectives of the project are to reconstruct and analyze forest dynamics at the treeline, to quantify the relationship between temperature and tree growth along altitudinal transects and to use these empirical data to improve the formulation and parameterization of the simulation model ForClim.
