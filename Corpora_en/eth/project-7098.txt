Evolutionary ecology of a Daphnia hybrid species complex Among other lakes we concentrate our research in the Greifensee. Hybrid Daphnia dominates several European lakes. In this project we want to get a better understanding of the production of hybrids. Normally daphnids reproduce parthenogenetically, but sexual reproduction is essential for the production of hybrids. Little is known about the clonal variation in sexual reproduction in lakes. Furthermore we study the fate of the produced resting eggs. A fraction of the resting eggs float and is blown to the shore, and another fraction sinks to the bottom. We investigate if this is a random effect or if genotypes differ in the floating abilities of their resting eggs. By studying resting eggs from sediment cores we obtain information about the genetic composition of the population in the past. We are able to hatch resting eggs up to 40 years old. This gives us also the possibility to do experimental work with these old clones. Since the water quality in the lake improved dramatically the last 30 years (less phosphorus) we will be able to investigate how this changes the genetic and taxon composition of the Daphnia population
