Controlling electronic transport at ferroelectric domain walls We study ferroelectric domain walls that exhibit anomalous transport behavior and identify pathways to gain control of their electronic properties. Ferroelectric domain walls in semiconducting hexagonal manganites can either mimic the electronic properties of the surrounding bulk, or they show enhanced/suppressed conduction properties. We study the nanoscale physics behind this unusual interface effect using scanning probe microscopy and tune the domain wall transport by doping charged ions into the host material.
