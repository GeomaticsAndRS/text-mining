Applied Vision Research - Ergonomic Eye Glasses for Presbyops One symptom appearing in the ageing eye is the loss of the capacity to focus near objects. Lenses are used to restore the loss of focal power. Bifocal, multifocal or varifocal glasses are used in order to enable bespectacled people to have clear vision when looking into the distance as well as when looking at near objects, while using only one pair of glasses. Especially the varifocal glasses influence the natural coordination between the movements of the eyes as well as the movements of the head. However little is known about the connection between changes in natural coordination and asthenopic and postural complaints. The coordination between the movements of the eyes and of the head is studied using an apparatus for recording eye and head movements simultaneously. Coordination of people wearing no glasses are recorded for different visual tasks. Their task specific characteristic coordination is defined as natural . Coordination is then studied for the same visual tasks by people wearing different kinds of glasses. The ergonomic quality of different lenses is determined to detect changes in their characteristic coordination. In further studies, visual and postural complaints will be correlated to differences between natural and task specific coordination. In collaboration with ESSILOR France an ergonomic lens for presbyops which takes account of the natural, task specific coordination is under construction.
