Electro-optic and Nonlinear Optical Polymers We investigate thin film nonlinear optical polymers for their possible use as integrated electro-optical modulators. The first step consists in the development of easily processable polymers with high nonlinearities and good long time stability. In a second step waveguide and modulator prototype devices based on previously evaluated polymers have to be processed and optimized in order to improve the inorganic LiNbO$_{3}$ standard. To induce a noncentrosymmetric state in the naturally isotropic polymer film it has to be poled by a static electric field. The films must be heated above the glass transition temperature Tg to achieve maximum mobility of the nonlinear optical groups for effective alignment under the field. Below Tg the polymers are relatively rigid. The poling induced orientational order of the nonlinear optical chromophores- a prerequisite for electro-optic activity in these systems - tends to relax with time and temperature. Therefore relaxation processes in nonlinear optical polymers are of considerable interest for obtaining a better understanding of the long-term stability of potentia devices fabricated from these materials. We investigated the relaxation mechanisms of our newly developed side and main chain polymers above and below the glass transition by second-harmonic decay, dielectric relaxation and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. All results are in good qualitative agreement with the predictions of a phenomenological model of the glass transition. From our measurements, one can expect temporal stability up to 100 years at temperatures 100 degrees below the glass transition. Further work is in progress to find chromophores with improved nonlinear optical properties. Finally, a simple electro-optic waveguide modulator will be fabricated based on our developments.
