A Finite Element Framework for Geotechnical Applications based onObject-Oriented Programming The project aims at creating a Finite Element Development Framework which elies on object oriented programming techniques. Thanks to incremental rogramming these techniques facilitate and accelerate the development of large computer programs. Object oriented programming techniques rastically reduce the expenditure for the support of such a framework, nd simultaneously guarantee high quality, portability and state-of-the-art nfrastructure. The objectives of the FE-framework IMAGINE (Integrated Modelling and Analysis in Geotechnics by the fINite Element method) are twofold: - provide scientists in the field of geotechnical engineering with the means to develop specific FE-programs - development of an example application for Geomechanics for a de facto evidence of the applicability of the framework. Furthermore this application might be used by students, scientists and engineers in practice. Main characteristics of the framework are - easy software support, i.e. easy maintenance, adaptation to new resources and extendibility, - enhanced reusability, implying understandability (readability, traceability, learnability), homogeneity and portability, - reliability, which designates the probability with which software does not cause the failure of a system, or lead to incorrect results, - software security, which means the degree to which software protects itself from unauthorized actions, - software safety, i.e. the probability that even an unintended usage does not lead to a mishap (hazard).
