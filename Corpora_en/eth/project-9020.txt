Genetic host determinants associated with the adhesion of E. coli with fimbriae F4 in swine Objectives of the project are (1) analyse the porcine sequences at candidate genes for differences that are associated with F4ac ETEC adhesion receptor phenotypes, (2) develop a genetic test which discriminates between F4ac ETEC adhesion susceptible and F4ac ETEC adhesion resistant pigs.
