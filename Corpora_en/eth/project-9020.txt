Genetic host determinants associated with the adhesion of E. coli with fimbriae F4 in swine Objectives of the project are (1) analyse the porcine sequences at candidate genes for differences that are associated with F4ac ETEC adhesion receptor phenotypes, (2) develop a genetic test which discriminates between F4ac ETEC adhesion susceptible and F4ac ETEC adhesion resistant pigs. Objectives of the project are (1) analyse the porcine sequences at candidate genes for differences that are associated with F4ac ETEC adhesion receptor phenotypes, (2) develop a genetic test which discriminates between F4ac ETEC adhesion susceptible and F4ac ETEC adhesion resistant pigs, and (3) assess linkage of the genes encoding F4abRw (F4ab weak adhesion) and F4adR, and microsatellites evenly distributed over the porcine genome. Genetic resistance to porcine neonatal and postweaning diarrhoea is associated with the absence of colonization of the intestine with enterotoxigenic (ETEC) Escherichia (E.) coli bacteria expressing fimbriae F4 (K88). The specific binding is mediated by receptors expressed on the surface of the brush borders in the intestine. Adhesion of fimbriae F4 has been shown to be genetically controlled by the host. Adhesion in neonatal and postweaning diarrhoea susceptible animals is dominant over the absence of adhesion in resistant animals.
