Nonlinear Analysis of Plane-Frame Structures The new Finite-Element Program STATIK-N was developed to investigate the nonlinear behaviour and the limit load of plane frame structures. Nonlinearities due to material behaviour in the form of plastic hinges or nonlinear elastic force-displacement laws, large deformations, contact problems at supports etc. can be taken into account. The program has implemented in it robust numerical algorithms, already well-established in Finite Element analysis. The user can visually follow the behaviour of the structure with an interactively menu-driven control of the iterative solution process for each load step. Internal forces and moments, displacements, reaction forces and the opening of plastic hinges are displayed on the computer screen. The new program STATIK-N, written in Pascal for the PC, was conceived as a postprocessor to the widely-used commercial program STATIK-2 of the software firm Cubus AG. It was intended to supply an easy-to-use instrument for tackling the difficult problem of incremental nonlinear structural analysis. The main emphasis has been placed on user-friendliness and the needs of engineering practice.
