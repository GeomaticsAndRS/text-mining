Multiferroic A2Ti2O7 [A=Pr,Nd,(Pr0.5,Gd0.5)]: Candidate materials to search for the electric dipole moment of the electron We use density functional theory to explore the suitability of the AnBnO3n+2 perovskite oxides as materials for searching for the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). The experimental search for the eEDM is of interest as its observation would confirm violation of charge-parity in the Universe.
