Interlacing Magnetic Resonance With the present project we aspire to integrate magnetic resonance (MR) velocity encoding and computational flow dynamics (CFD) to enable accurate quantification of wall shear stresses in-vivo. The work addresses the limited resolution of MR velocity encoding in shear layers. With the present project we aspire to integrate magnetic resonance (MR) velocity encoding and computational flow dynamics (CFD) to enable accurate quantification of wall shear stresses invivo. The work addresses the limited resolution of MR velocity encoding in shear layers by exploiting CFD approaches while simultaneously relying on MR data exclusively for transient or turbulent core flows that are difficult or impossible to model using current CFD methods. To this end, interlacing of MR image reconstruction and CFD in partial domains is proposed to allow for patient-specific quantification of shear rates and wall shear stresses in the aortic root and ascending aorta. We will demonstrate and validate the concept using dedicated and realistic computer and experimental models of the aortic root, ascending aorta and aortic arch. To demonstrate the impact of native aortic valve pathology we will examine the impact of cuspidity (bicuspid vs tricuspid valve) under non-stenotic and stenotic conditions. Thereafter, in-vivo applications in patients with aortic stenosis, ascending aortic aneurysms (with and without aortic valve pathology) are envisaged to assess the feasibility of the framework in clinical study populations.
