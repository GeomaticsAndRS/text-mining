Self aligned transistors Self alignment lithography techniques are developed to enable the reliable fabrication of TFTs on flexible Substrates. The channel length and the gate-drain overlap will be reduced to values below 2 ¸ tm and 0.5 ¸ tm, respectively. This should enable transistor operation above 200 MHz.
