Man Machine Interaction - Interface Design: Evaluation of a Tangible Workbench for ChemistryEducation Augmented Chemistry (AC) is an up-and-running workbench for chemistry education. This project aims to evaluate the usability of the system and which is the educational effect compared to alternative means. The system consists of a table and a rear-projection screen. Right below the screen sits a camera recording user interaction that takes place upon and above the tabletop. The screen displays what this camera sees. This is meant to give the user the feeling of a mirror. This mirror image is then enriched with a virtual environment. Users interact with models in this virtual environment using a booklet, a cube, a platform, and a so-called Gripper. Further adaptation and evaluation of the system is needed to give it a place in most classrooms. The company Graviton is commercializing the system in its current form. For the product to become widely used, user studies and the evaluation of learning effect are needed. Only when it is proven that students prefer to use a Tangible User Interface to learn a given science curriculum and that they learn the given curriculum just as well as, or preferably better than, with traditional means, the AC system can achieve a wide spread use.
