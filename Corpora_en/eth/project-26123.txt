HydroServ - Vulnerability of hydrological ecosystem services: Integrative analysis under changes of climate and socio-economy with an emphasis on adaptation People rely on the integrity of ecosystems to provide hydrological ecosystem services (HES) because they are essential to human existence. Many key economic sectors such as agriculture, hydropower, re-insurance, recreation, and the drinking water sector depend on HES. Yet, human activities and global climate change are jeopardizing the ability of ecosystems to deliver HES, which results in increasing economic costs. Besides a mitigation approach, this calls for adaptation measures related to ecosystem management to foster the regulating and insurance services that ecosystems provide. We propose to analyze and simulate the full value chains of HES provided by terrestrial ecosystems under climatic and socio-economic changes. We suggest developing an integrated modeling system linking hydrological, ecological, and economical sub-models into a multi-period, spatially explicit Bayesian network that allows for feedback from changing socio-economic and political conditions to land-use and adaptation to climate change. The potential impacts of the impending changes of climate and land use and land cover on HES and the adaptive capacity of the system are integrated into vulnerability maps containing a representation of the modeling uncertainties. Based on this analysis, the project aims at (i) analyzing the consequences of climate and socio-economic changes on water resources and on the related HES in an integrative manner; and (ii) assisting policy makers in their decision-making through the design of innovative instruments for the public and private sectors and institutional regulations, which will be required to respond to the anticipated changes while preserving a balance between demand and supply of HES.
