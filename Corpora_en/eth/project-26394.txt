Time-resolved high-harmonic spectroscopy of chemical reactions High-harmonic generation will be employed as a probe to characterize the evolution of the electronic structure of a molecule undergoing a photochemical reaction initiated by a femtosecond pump pulse. The objective of the proposed research is the experimental characterization of the dynamic evolution of the valence electronic structure of a molecule undergoing a photochemical reaction. Understanding how the electronic structure changes along a reaction pathway may help improving theoretical quantum chemical methods and may lead to improved strategies in chemical synthesis and catalysis. We propose to use high-harmonic generation (HHG) as a probe of the electronic structure. A femtosecond ultraviolet light pulse will be used to excite the molecule in a transient grating geometry. A delayed, intense infrared laser pulse will generate high-order harmonics from the molecule. The transient grating geometry allows the background-free detection of the molecular dynamics and provides a simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and phase of the high harmonics emitted by the excited molecules. The properties of the high-harmonic radiation convey precise information about the electronic structure of the molecule. This experimental scheme will be combined with the impulsive alignment of the molecules prior to photoexcitation, which will allow for a very detailed measurement of the electronic structure in the molecular frame. To extend the range of the emitted frequencies and to unambiguously separate structural from dynamical information, we plan to generate high harmonics using tunable mid-infrared radiation using an optical parametric amplifier to be purchased from this grant. The milestones of the project are as follows: construction of an extreme ultraviolet spectrometer to detect the high harmonic radiation, construction of an optical setup for transient-grating spectroscopy, achieving and controlling the impulsive alignment of molecules using an infrared laser pulse, recording and analysis of the experimental data from unaligned molecules excited by the ultraviolet light and probed by high-harmonic generation, combining impulsive alignment and photoexcitation, recording and analysis of the experimental data from aligned molecules (as a function of pump-probe delay and as a function of the orientation of the molecule relative to the polarization of the probe pulse). The measurements on randomly aligned molecules are expected to provide the (femtosecond) time constants of population flow between electronic states. The outcome of the experiment will be modeled and compared with wave packet calculations. The measurements using aligned molecules should permit the characterization of the detailed electronic structure (symmetry and nodal structure of orbitals) of the states that are being populated which will be compared with theoretical calculations. 1.
