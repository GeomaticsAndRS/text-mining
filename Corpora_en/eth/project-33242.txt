Deformation Capacity of Structural Masonry The present research project aims at improving the state of knowledge on the deformation capacity and, simultaneously, increasing the utilization of structural masonry. Furthermore, a new mechanical model will be established to improve the design of structural masonry under (seismic) shear loading
