Carbon Nanotube-based Ultra-miniature Pressure Sensors This project aims for the development of an ultra-miniature pressure sensor based on a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. The minute size of single-walled carbon nanotubes offers the possibility of sensor devices that may surpass state-of-the-art devices in both size and power consumption.
