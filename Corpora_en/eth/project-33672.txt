Improvement of GNSS kinematic positioning with low-cost receiver clocks This project tries to access the benefits in GNSS pseudorange kinematic positioning by connecting low-cost high-quality receiver clocks with low-cost GNSS receivers and applying appropriate receiver clock models. Field experiments are going to be performed on a moving platform. In this project, we are going to make use of the low-cost high-stability receiver clocks with good mobility and generate appropriate clock models for these clocks to improve the pseudorange kinematic positioning results, especially under bad measurement environments and geometries. The relationship between different clock models, improvement of the code kinematic positioning results, clock qualities, measurement noise and conditions, sampling intervals and measurement durations are studied in details. The low-cost clocks provided by Spectratime are going to be connected with GNSS receivers and tested in field experiments on a moving platform. A Java real-time GNSS processing software with a Kalman filter applying different clock models is going to be developed to process the data from the experiments in real-time mode. The results will be analyzed and compared with the results processed in post-processing mode using the Bernese GNSS Software (Version 5.0) and Matlab.
