Nonlinear Discrete Optimization We classify nonlinear discrete problems according to their computational complexity. Special emphasis is on optimizing convex functions over lattice points in polyhedra. This establishes a link to Hilbert basis theory and N-fold systems. Research efforts of the past fifty years have led to a development of linear integer programming as a mature discipline of mathematical optimization. Such a level of maturity has not been reached when one considers nonlinear systems subject to integrality requirements for the variables. The primary goal is a study of a simple version of general nonlinear integer problems, where all constraints are still linear. Our focus is on the computational complexity of the problem, which varies significantly with the type of nonlinear objective function in combination with the underlying combinatorial structure. Numerous boundary cases of complexity emerge, which sometimes surprisingly lead even to polynomial time algorithms. It is our belief that the study of algorithms motivated by theoretical considerations will shape this subject.
