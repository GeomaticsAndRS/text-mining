The transport equations for heat and moisture in porous structures The transport of heat and moisture in porous structures still presents principal problems of understanding. In a first attempt, the existing equations have been thoroughly investigated to exploit there potential. Some interesting results could be obtained: - A principal ambiguity in the description of non-linear heat and moisture fields. (Res.Rep. Nr.3/97) - A complete and final discussion of capillar dynamics. (Res.Rep.Nr.4/97) - A reformulation and solution of the Ljukov system of equations by so-called diffusors . (Res.Rep. Nr.4/97) One further result is the start of the project Heat and moisture transport in fractal structures . The goal: Clarifying and understanding the existing phenomenological equations for heat and moisture transport in porous structures.
