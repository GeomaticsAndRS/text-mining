The role of genetic diversity and interaction of fungal symbionts in PAC-woody-plant systems. PAC (Philaocephala fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata species complex) are dominat root endophytes in forest ecosystems. We study virulence, host preference and interactions of different PAC species in a multipartite experimental system at different temperatures. The project is part of GEDIHAP.
