The impact of the liberalization of public services on the competi-tiveness of firms in theAlpine regions of Switzerland In recent years, public services have undergone a number of radical changes in the wake of a gen-eral process of economic transformation. The market-oriented reorganisation of capacity in the supply of public services has affected outlying regions more than urban centres and led to an in-crease in economic concentration and regional disparity. The project looks at these interconnections between the different aspects of change in the supply of public services and the development of business as well as the relative significance of supply of services as a dynamic locational factor for businesses in the Swiss Alpine regions. The objective of the project focuses on being able to present policymakers with a number of possible ways of en-suring a satisfactory regional provision of public services.
