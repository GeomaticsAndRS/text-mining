Process development for renewable-resource based polymers In the current context of tackling global climate change and dependency on oil, the development of energy carriers and materials based on renewable resources has become a major interest in both academic and industrial research. Among those, the synthesis of green polymers to eventually replace the world's third-largest polymer application, namely PET plastics for bottles, packaging, synthetic fibers and such, is believed to have a major impact on future sustainability and economy. Considering that furan derivatives as possible polymer precursors from biological residues have become industrial commodities, the possible economic impact of renewable polymers is becoming more and more attractive. Moreover, furan-based PEF and PBF have already been synthesized and shown to possess advantageous properties over PET, such as gas permeability, mechanic stability and processability. The aim of this project is to elaborate more on the efficiency of synthesis pathways for renewable resource based PEF and PBF polymers.
