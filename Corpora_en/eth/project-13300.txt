Centrifugal processing of metallic liquids - a new method for development of bulk metallic glasses and studies of thermophysical properties under ultrahigh gravity The solidification of liquid metallic alloys under the influence of high inertial accelerations up to 100,000 g is investigated. The accelerations are produced by the rotation of metallic melts in a centrifuge capable of operating at high temperatures up to 1200 Ë‡rC.
