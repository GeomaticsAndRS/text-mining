Magnetoplasticity of Ferromagnetic Intermetallics Magnetoplasticity is the spontaneous plastic deformation of a ferromagnetic material in response to an applied magnetic field. The achievable strains are larger by more than an order of magnitude than in conventional magnetostriction. The effect is related to a specific twin-domain structure and the field-induced motion of twin boundaries. Magnetoplasticity is thus the magnetic counterpart to ferroelectricity that originates from a coupling of polarization and deformation by twin-boundary motion. A magnet of variable field strength and variable field direction was used to measure the magnetoplastic response of Ni-Mn-Ga alloys to a rotating magnetic field. Strains of up to 10% have been obtained. Magneto-mechanical spectroscopy and fatigue experiments indicate that the detailed microstructure must be studied in more detail, primarily by use of transmission electron microscopy, out in order to better understand mechanisms and limits of magnetoplasticity. Further experimental and theoretical work is carried out at Boise State University by P. Muellner and co-workers.
