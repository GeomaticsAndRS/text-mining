Genetic Markers in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients from Munich and Chur diagnosed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were entered into this study. Of these patients a gene sequence within the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class II molecules of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) were analysed. The amino-terminal extrcellular domain of the beta chain of the heterodimeric HLA-DR subtype is a highly polymorphic region. This region is analysed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Sequence Specific Oligonucleotide Probes (SSOPs). Some sequences of the different HLA DRB1 types are discribed to be associated with. rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with and without RA related HLA DRB1 alleles are compared with levels of cytokines, cytokine inhibitors, adhesion molecules and disease severity parameter to may get a better understanding of the disease.
