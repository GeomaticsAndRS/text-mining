Steam Turbine Aerodynamics and Geometry Optimization for Effective Reduction of Leakage Flow Interactions The objective of this project is to investigate the impact of cavity volume and length scale on shrouded turbine stage efficiency. The experimental test facility LISA of LEC will be employed modified as a 2 stage axial shrouded turbine with blade geometry being characteristic of steam turbines.
