N-Directional Approach to Constitutive laws The N-Directional Approach numerically describes material behaviour. Instead of using tensorial stress-strain relations, the continuum is modelled by the superposition of a finite number N of uniaxial sub-continua each of them transmitting a normal stress in its direction only. If these N directions are evenly distributed, linear isotropic elasticity can be modelled exactly in an almost un-coupled way. This model can be viewed as a generalised spring model where the N spring forces act in cleverly chosen directions. The fundamental assumption of the N-Directional Approach is that this un-coupling property is also valid in the non-linear, large-strain case. The directional stress transmitted by each sub-continuum is computed as a non-linear function of the corresponding normal strain and the volumetric strain only. For this case the logarithmic strains, which represent the natural and physically meaningful way of measuring large uniaxial deformations, can be consistently used.
