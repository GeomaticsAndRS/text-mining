Optimum Dimensioning of Reinforced Concrete Structures A new procedure for dimensioning reinforced concrete structures based on plasticity theory and the finite element method has been developed. This procedure is implemented into three separate user-friendly computer programs, which are geared to the needs of engineering practice. They deal with shear walls, flat slabs as well as three-dimensional structures consisting of flat panel-type elements. In the first phase, the structure is analysed for all load cases assuming linear elastic behaviour. Based on the internal forces thus computed, the necessary amounts of steel in each user-defined reinforcement field is then determined. Next, the optimisation phase follows, where plastic deformations are introduced which are chosen so as to obtain a more favourable stress distribution. Linear programming techniques are applied to minimise the total volume of steel taking into account constructional constraints. The programs can also be used to determine the ultimate load of a given distribution of reinforcement.
