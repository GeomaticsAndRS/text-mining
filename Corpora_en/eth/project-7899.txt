Oculomotor Control The oculomotor system, with its few degrees of freedom and its close integration with the visual and vestibular system, lends itself to quantitative modeling of clinical and animal data. In particular Listing's law is a very powerful mode of integration between stereovision and binocular motor control, about which important neural data are gathered in the Department of Neurology in Zürich. We are participating in the analysis of experiments and are developing models for the superior colliculus, the velocity-to-position integrator and the oculomotor plant.
