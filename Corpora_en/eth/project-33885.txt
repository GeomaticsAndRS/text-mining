MERCO - Mediated Effective Remote Collaboration The outcome of this project will be a collaboration system in hard- and software, which can be deployed by the partners to improve net-based collaboration The goal of MERCO is to realize a next-generation remote collaboration system by also transferring body postures, deictic gestures, and other non-verbal communication elements (work space) and by combining this geometrically correct with the shared content of a digital whiteboard (task space). Interative methods and tools, technical solutions, and experimentally validated knowledge from MERCO will enable more natural and efficient networked team meetings. A particular focus will be given to early phases of product design.
