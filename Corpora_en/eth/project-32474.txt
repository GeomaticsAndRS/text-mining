Investigating the distribution of engineered nanoparticles in river systems under realistic conditions The distribution of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in a river is investigated with the example of the Rhone River, France; interactions between ENPs and suspended particulate matter are characterized and included in an environmental fate model for ENPs.
