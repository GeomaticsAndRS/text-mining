Garnet Peridotites Central Alps, Deepest rocks in the world? In this project recent theories about ultradeep origin of garnet peridotites from the Central Alps, especially Alpe Arami, are evaluated. TEM studies, UV Laser ICPMS, high-pressure experimental and petrographic and microprobe investigations suggest a much shallower origin than anticipated by an American researchers group from Riverside California. Project involves a doctorate thesis.
