Robustness of the Internet at the Topology and Routing Level Over the past 10 years, the Internet has become a crucial part of our information and communication infrastructure. E-commerce, public services (e-government), trade, content distribution, private banking, and the whole economy depend more and more on the reliable operation of the public Internet. Even short network outages can disrupt the operation of companies significantly and cause the loss of large sums of money. Therefore, the robustness of the Internet is an important, timely, interesting, and challenging topic for research. In this project, we perform an in-depth study of the Internet topology with an emphasis on robustness properties. In particular, we want - to investigate different ways and methodologies to measure robustness of networks (e.g., resilience to random node failures (fragility), resilience to attacks (vulnerability), or number of alternative paths), - to analyze the real Internet and parts of it with respect to these properties, - to explain the observed properties by appropriate models, - and to study trade-offs between the robustness and the complexity of a network. We will consider both the topology of the network (viewed as a graph with nodes and edges) and the routing policies in use, because the routing policies affect the possible paths that packets can take in the network and it is important to assess their impact on robustness properties.
