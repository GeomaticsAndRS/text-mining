NA61/SHINE studies hadron production in hadron-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS The experiment provides hadron production reference measurements for neutrino (T2K) and cosmic-ray (Pierre Auger Observatory) and KASCADE experiments. The NA61/SHINE (SPS Heavy Ion and Neutrino Experiment) experiment at the CERN SPS provides precise hadron production measurements for improving calculations of the neutrino flux in the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment and for more reliable simulations of cosmic-ray air showers in the Pierre Auger and KASCADE experiments. The NA61 experiment has measured particle production in 30 GeV proton Carbon interactions. Two different targets have been used, a thin (4% int) C target for a measurement of the primary p C interactions and an actual T2K replica target (1.9 int). Particle production spectra from the T2K replica target provide a measurement of re-interactions by comparing the distributions with the thin C target and can also be directly used as input to the T2K neutrino beam Monte Carlo generator. c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
