13C-18O bonds in carbonate minerals: Calibration and applications of a new paleothermomether in Earth Sciences. With this project we will develop a new carbonae paleothermometer based on the abundance of 13C-18O bonds in the carbonate molecule. We will then apply this new method for paleoclimate reconstructions from marine and lacustrine sediments.
