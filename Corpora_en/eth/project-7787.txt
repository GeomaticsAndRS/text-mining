The CMS Experiment at the LHC The future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will provide proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14TeV. This very high energy will allow to experimentally clarify the origin of particle masses (i.e. the existence of the Higgs particle), and to explore new physics in the TeV mass range. The expected low event rate for many of the predicted physics processes require to detect cleanly diverse signatures by identifying and precisely measuring photons, electrons and muons over a large energy range. The CMS experiment, a general purpose detector proposed for the LHC has been designed to fulfill these goals. Precise measurements of photons and electrons require an excellent electromagnetic calorimeter. Our research activities concentrate on Lead Tungstenate crystals, proposed for CMS. These studies include tests of crystal qualities like uniformity, radiation hardness, mechanical properties, etc. as well as front-end readout electronics. Besides the electromagnetic calorimeter the laboratory is part of the central tracker group to develop and construct the Si-microstrip subdetector. In addition physics performance studies for the crystal calorimeter and global detector performance simulations are carried out aiming at overall detector design optimization. The concept of CMS is based on a 14 meter long high field superconducting solenoid, providing a very good momentum resolution. Such large scale magnets are characterized by high rated current and large amount of stored energy. An intensive research program on superconducting cable manufacturing and quality assurance is in progress.
