Effects of dynamic light and phosphorus supplies on phytoplankton Phytoplankton experience highly dynamic conditions with respect to light climate, nutrient supply and other environmental factors. Due to tight physical-biological coupling in aquatic ecosystems it is likely that fluctuations in resources have a strong effect on phytoplankton. In this project we investigate how non-equilibrium supplies of light and phosphorus affect (i) primary production, population dynamics and community structure of selected algae in multispecies communities and (ii) physiological performance in monocultures of Nitzschia sp., Sphaerocystis schroeteri, Phormidium luridum and Anabaena flos-aquae. The following aspects are currently investigated: - the abilities of different phytoplankton species to utilize fluctuating light, - effects of variable phosphorus uptake rates on phytoplankton resource competition, - interactive effects of phosphorus limitation and daylength on individual species and competitive communities of phytoplankton, - modeling the effect of dynamic light regime on the phytoplankton competition for phosphorus (P)
