Hydraulics of spatial dike breaches Dikes along rivers prevent flooding of the adjoining environment during high-floods. Overtopping has caused large damages in the past. The goal of the present research project is to analyse spatial dike breaches through laboratory tests using a new non-intrusive photogrammetric system.
