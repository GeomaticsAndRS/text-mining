Assessing the potential of biochar amendments to decrease N losses from agricultural soils we identify the conditions in which BC prevents N losses by examining: effect of different BC materials on overall N cycling from a process and microbial levels; interactions between N inputs and BC additions; role of soil pH on end products of denitrification;and performance of BC at farm-level.
