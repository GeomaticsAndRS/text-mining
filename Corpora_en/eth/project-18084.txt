Low-Noise InP HEMTs Development of low-noise InP HEMTs for deep space applications such as satellite communications and radio-astronomy. Ultra-low noise transistors are developed on the nanometer scale for cryogenic applications by the European Space Agency (ESA). The work is funded by ESA through TRP and GSTP grants.
