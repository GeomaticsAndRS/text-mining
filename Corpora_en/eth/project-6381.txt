Cell-cell Contact Establishment in ARC ARC in culture do not move and can only make contact to neighbouring cells by stretching and increasing in size (hypertrophy). The cell-cell contacts in cardiac cells are the so-called intercalated discs and they are reformed in vitro upon contact. ARC are coupled electrically and metabolically through ID's. We are mainly interested to concentrate our studies on the regulation and control of proteins involved in particular parts of the ID-structure. CA$^{++}$-dependend N-cadherins establishes the homophilic cell contacts through their extracellular domains; we believe that N-cadherin establishes the first contacts and forms adherens junctions, while another class of junction proteins - connection 43 forms the gap-junctions. We are mutating N-cadherin by deletion of extra and intracellular domains and investigate after transfection or microinjection its expression and interference with contact formation and signal transduction via catenin the complex.
