Impact of organic amendments on the phosphate nutrition of crops and on phosphate transformations in lixisols from semi-arid West Africa Organic matter and phosphate (P) inputs are essential to restore the fertility of the fragile soils in West Africa (lixisols) and to improve crop production. This project will evaluate long, medium and short term effects of organic amendments on crop production, plant nutrition and soil fertility.
