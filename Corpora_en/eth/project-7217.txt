3D Imaging of the Human Heart by Transoesophageal Ultrasound Imaging of the human heart in vivo can be achieved by x-ray projections which involves the application of x-ray contrast agents locally and of ionizing radiation in the catheter laboratory. MR imaging offers an attractive alternative, however, this method is still associated with considerable expense and not fully operational in real time (yet). For real-time, non invasive imaging, ultrasound is advantageous because of its harmless nature and ease of application, but image quality is still insufficient. The transducer is best placed in the oesophagus for the purpose of imaging the heart because this location is close and no interfering structures such as ribs are present. An improved 3D representation of the heart in real time requires the development of suitable transducers, pulse patterns and sequences along with associated imaging procedures and software.
