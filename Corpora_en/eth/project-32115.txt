Intelligent technologies for sustainable process design and operation The overall objective is to develop new concepts and methods, models and solution algorithms through simulation, optimization and knowledge management for sustainable design and operation of process industries. This research line aims to optimize performance of chemical processes, ranging from operational to enterprise wide level, towards safety and sustainability based on the intelligent management of resources. Chemical processes consume and produce a large amount of materials, energy and intangible resources. Material resources encompass a wide variety of resources, including raw materials, by-products, recycled streams, waste and final products, as well as those utilities required for the process operation, such as water, solvents, compressed air or inert gases. Energy resources, such as fuel, steam and electricity, usually have a high impact on cost and environmental impact. Thus, the generalized use of fossil fuel, which is a unique source of multiple raw materials, as energy source stands for a critical problem for the sustainability of chemical and other process industries. As for intangible resources, processes require and generate a large amount of data, information and knowledge, such as the values of the process variables, set points, production levels, operational and legal constraints or human labour requirements, among many others.
