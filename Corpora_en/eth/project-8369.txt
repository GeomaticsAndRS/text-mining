SHeterogous ¸ expression and functional analysis of membrane-bound alkane hydroxylasesT Heterologous expression of several membrane-bound alkane hydroxylases has allowed us to select substrate range mutants. The changed amino acid positions are targetted by protein engineering to change the substrate range and the stereo- and enantioselectivity of alkane hydroxylases.
