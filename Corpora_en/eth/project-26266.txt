Membrane-based CO2 Separation For facile and energy-efficient carbon capture process, this project targets separation of CO2 from the flue gas via novel membrane based on carbon nanomaterials. Knowledge and techniques achieved from this project will help us contribute scientifically to future carbon emission mitigation.
