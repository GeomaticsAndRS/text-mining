Advanced integration of energy conversion, production processes and waste management in chemical batch plants This project aims at a holistic analysis of a multipurpose/multiproduct batch plant. In this context a methodology is developed that accounts for the integration of the processes together with the energy conversion and the waste management sub-systems,enabling mass and energy saving potentials.
