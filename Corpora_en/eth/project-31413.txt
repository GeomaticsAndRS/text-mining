Model development and optimization of fed-batch and continuous mammalian cell culture processes for the production of therapeutic proteins On the effect of key process parameters on cell performance, metabolism and product quality in continuous mammalian cell culture. The production of therapeutic proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb), is nowadays realized by cultivation of mammalian cells using batch, fed-batch or even continuous conditions. The increased production demand and number of therapeutics, requires the development of new and the optimization of existing mammalian cell culture processes. To minimize the high experimental load needed, when using a design of experiments (DOE) approach, this project is focused on the development of a suitable mathematical model capable to describe the effect of operating parameters such as pH, O2, CO2, hydrodynamic stress, osmolality and media composition on mammalian cell culture. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) will be used to further understand the underlying mechanisms of cellular growth and metabolism during various cultivation modes (fed-batch and continuous). Acquired knowledge is consequently applied in the quantitative optimization of culture processes.
