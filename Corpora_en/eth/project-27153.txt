Carbon nanotubes based solar cells Developing inexpensive and renewable energy sources is one of the most important scientific and technological challenges of our times. Solar energy is an inexhaustible energy source that can be harnessed to meet our growing future energy needs. Developing inexpensive and renewable energy sources is one of the most important scientific and technological challenges of our times. Solar energy is an inexhaustible energy source that can be harnessed to meet our growing future energy needs. However, traditional photovoltaic (solar-toelectric conversion) technology is too expensive to be the suitable alternative for fossil fuels or even other competing renewable energy sources. A significant leap in the scientific and technological progress of renewable energy sources will be required to displace proven, but unsustainable energy production methods. Increases in efficiency have been brought about by implanting carbon nanotubes onto the surface of solar cells in order to reduce the reflection of sunrays. Carbon nanotubes (CNT), especially single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT), are attracting much attention in the scientific community because of their remarkable properties, such as electrical, optical, and thermal properties, mechanical strength, and high catalytic surface area. In addition, CNT can be chemically modified, covalently or noncovalently, allowing a good dispersion in a polymer matrix. Such modifications give rise to high performance polymer nanocomposites at low loadings of CNT. SWCNT are one-dimensional nanowires that can be found in metallic and semiconducting states. They can readily accept electrons and transport them under nearly ideal conditions along the axis.
