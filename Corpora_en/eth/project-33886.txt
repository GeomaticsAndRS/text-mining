Adaptive Solar Envelope ETH AS is developing the prototype of an innovative façade system on parts of the façades of the ETH House of Natural Resources (HoNR). ETH AS is developing the prototype of an innovative façade system on parts of the façades of the ETH house of Natural Resources (HoNR). The building envelope, acting as a buffer and mediator between interior and exterior environments, is a suitable place to address issues of energy performance in architecture, as it can mitigate solar insolation, thereby offering reductions in heating/cooling loads, improve distribution of daylight and harvest solar energy. ETH AS employs novel actuators in order to research and design modules for the building envelope which allow for (a) active shading and glare reduction, (b) daylight distribution, and (c) sun tracking and energy generation. Following the recent developments towards decentralized buiding systems, the envelope is conceived as a modular system, which allows these functions to be distributed and mixed across the envelope and even across a window in the most optimal way. This results in a dynamic multifunctional envelope, which increases the building's energy performance and the occupant's well being.
