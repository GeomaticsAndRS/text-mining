Production of cyclic oligomers from renewable resource based monomers. The aim of this project is to develop a production process for cyclic oligoesters of poly(butylene furfural) PBF and poly(ethylene furfural) (PEF), to be used as monomers for ring opening polymerization towards high molecular weight.
