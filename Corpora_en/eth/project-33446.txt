Production of cyclic oligomers from renewable resource based monomers. The aim of this project is to develop a production process for cyclic oligoesters of poly(butylene furfural) PBF and poly(ethylene furfural) (PEF), to be used as monomers for ring opening polymerization towards high molecular weight. Cyclic oligoesters of poly(butylene furfural) PBF and poly(ethylene furfural) (PEF)will be produced via different synthetic routes. A variety of techniques will be adapted to characterize the products. Eventually it will be attempted to scale up the most promising route. Detailed kinetic models will be developed in order to optimize productivity and yield of the reaction and purification. The oligomers will be used in a different project to yield high molecular weight polymer via ring opening polymerization.
