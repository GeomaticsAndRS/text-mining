Project conferences and meetings were held during 1996-2003 in Frankfurt, Hamburg, London, New York (multiple), Oxford, Paris (multiple) and Zurich. The results have been published in March 2004 (Anatomy of Corporate Law, Oxford University Press, Spring 2004, 226 p.). The co-authors are Reinier Kraakman (Harvard), Paul Davies (LSE), Henry Hasmann (Yale), Gerard Hertig (ETH Zurich), Klaus J. Hopt (MPI Hamburg), Hideki Kanda (Tokyo) and Edward Rock (Pennsylvania). The book has been translated in Chinese, Japanese and Italian. Additional project meetings were held during 2006-08 in New York , Lucerne and New Haven. A second edition of the Anatomy book has been published in August 2009 (Anatomy of Corporate Law, Oxford University Press, Summer 2009, 322 p.) with two additional co-authors, John Armour (Oxford) and Luca Enriques (Bologna/Consob).
