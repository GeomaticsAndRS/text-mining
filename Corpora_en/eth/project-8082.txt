Dynamische Tragfähigkeit von Stahlbetonplatten bei Steinschlag / Impact Load Capacity of Reinforced Concrete Slabs due to Rockfall Events at the beginning of 2003 (Chüebalmtunnel, 04.01.2003; Axenstrasse, 11.02.2003; Lawinengalerie Ripplistal, 29.04.2003) have shown that impact by rockfall is still a hazard scenario that cannot be disregarded for the infrastructures in alpine regions. The Swiss guideline for the design of rock fall protection galleries goes back to 1996 and uses a static equivalent force for the impact load. The design concept contains a coefficient to consider either a ductile or a brittle fracture without considering the dynamic behavior of the slab. In the past few years, tests have been carried out, focusing on action effect of an cushion layer on a slab due to rockfall. Also damage models for impact loads have been a field of research. Not to be neglected are the expansion and the improvements in the application of finite elements, that allow to simulate reinforced concrete subject to dynamic loads. The aim of this project is to provide a better understanding of the dynamic response and the impact load capacity of rockfall protection galleries. These results together with the findings in the behavior of insulation beds could lead to a new practice friendly design concept which takes into consideration the dynamic behavior of the structure.
