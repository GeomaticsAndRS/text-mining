Quantifying lacustrine sedimentation using high-resolution geophysical imaging: Reconstructing climatic, human and tectonic impact on lakes This research program aims to quantify environmental conditions and changes using geophysical techniques to image selected lacustrine archives and by calibrating these images with sediment cores. Reconstructions will include climate fluctuations, human-induced disturbances, and tectonic events.
