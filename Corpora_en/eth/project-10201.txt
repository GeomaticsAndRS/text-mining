ALPSCAPE: Linking land use, resource and economic models to simulate the development of Alpine Regions ALPSCAPE befasst sich mit der Problematik der Auswirkung politischer und wirtschaftlicher Entscheidungen auf die Landnutzung, den Stoffhaushalt und die Wirtschafts- struktur alpiner Regionen (Fallstudienregion: Landschaft Davos). Im Fokus steht die Verknüpfung von räumlich expliziten und räumlich nich The ALPSCAPE project aims at developing a learning tool for regional development in the Alps including land use, resource management and economic structures (case study region: Davos landscape). The main focus of the project lies on the correlation of spatially explicit and spatially inexplicit modeling approaches. The spatially explicit approach incorporates the modeling of landuse changes (GIS-based) and environmental services. The spatially inexplicit approaches include input-output analysis and material flow analysis. Thus, the feasibility of correlating land use models (GIS) and models for economic development and natural resource consumption is examined. In terms of an end product, user groups will be provided with a learning tool with which the possible effects of decisions on different sectors can be simulated. The project is divided into two PhD thesis projects on spatially explicit modeling (GIS-based models and environmental services) and various smaller sub-projects in the areas of (i) spatially inexplicit approaches (material flow analysis and input-output analysis) and (ii) the integration of the user group into model development (process monitoring). The status quo in the Davos landscape should be recorded by the end of 2003 and the scenarios for future development defined. The model will be completed and the scenarios calculated and tested by possible users in 2004.
