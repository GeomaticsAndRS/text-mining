Microcoils and Hall sensors as detectors in EPR Present EPR spectrometers are optimized for samples having a volume between (1 mm)^3 and (1 cm)^3 and achieve spin sensitivities of about 10^{10} spins/G Hz^{1/2}. For sensitivity reasons, for small samples small detection systems should be used. We develop two types of EPR detection systems for samples in the range between 1 micrometer and 1 mm, namely inductive detection with planar microcoils and Hall detection with micro-Hall sensors. Because of the high spin sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and versatility of the proposed methods, new spectroscopic investigations will become feasible. (in collaboration with Dr. G.
