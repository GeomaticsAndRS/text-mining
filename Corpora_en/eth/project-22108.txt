Processing of magneto-responsive bio-microstructure (EU-NANOBIOMAG) Magnetic field effects on biological molecules are rarly observed, due to the small diamagnetic susceptibility of individual molecules. In self-assembly systems, such as phospholipid bilayers, where the molecules are aggregated parallel to each other, the anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility
