Lie's II theorem of Stacky groupoids As we know Lie'III theorem of Lie algebroids shows that it has 1-1 correspondence to stacky groupoids. We prove Lie's II theorem, namely the 1-1 correspondence between morphisms of the infinitesimal object $­the Lie algebroid and that of the global object $\cG$­the source 2-connected groupoids.
