Integration of Earth rotation, geometry and gravity field using space geodetic observations The determination of Earth rotation (e.g., pole coordinates, length of day, nutation, etc.) requires the combined adjustment with the EarthSs geometry (station positions and their time variations) and the gravity field (low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients) using space geodetic observations. The integration of Earth rotation, geometry and the gravity field into a unified system is one of the major goals of modern geodesy and the Global Geodetic Observing System (GGOS). The determination of parameters of Earth rotation (e.g., pole coordinates, length of day, nutation parameters, etc.) requires the combined adjustment with the EarthSs geometry (station positions and their temporal variations) and the gravity field (primarily the low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients) using space geodetic observa ntions. Based on unified standards for the modeling and parameterization, homogeneously re-processed time series of the space geodetic observation techniques (primarily GPS, VLBI and SLR) over a long time span (i.e., VLBI and SLR since 1984, GPS since 1994) will be generated. A major focus will be on the development of improved combination methods, which will be applied for the combination of the different space geodetic observations. The rigorous combination of these observations will guarantee, that the results are really consistent, that the complementary space techniques are fully exploited, and that technique-specific biases may be distinguished from the geophysical signal. The results are the full set of EOPSs, and, in addition, the terrestrial and celestial reference frame and the low-degree spherical harmonic coefficients of the EarthSs gravity. They form a fundamental input for many projects of the research unit.
