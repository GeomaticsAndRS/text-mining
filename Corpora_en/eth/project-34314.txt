Geometric and Analytic Number Theory Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Many of its unsolved problems are simple to state, but their solution requires very advanced methods. This project is devoted to developing such tools and applying them, especially in relation with harmonic analysis and algebraic geometry. Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. Many of its prominent unsolved problems, like the prime twin problem, are simple to state and typically relate to a counting question. In the 20th century, after pioneering early contributions of Euler, Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann and others, enormous progress has been made with problems of this type, for example with the theory of diophantine equations, the distribution of primes, or the theory of elliptic curves. Analytic number theory, as we understand the subject in this proposal, is the use of harmonic analysis to examine counting processes and related questions, whereas geometric number theory draws its ideas from algebraic geometry, or more specifically diophantine geometry. Here the spacing between the integers is often the root of first principles for counting. Both sub-branches have contributed considerably to the development of the subject in the recent past, and there are strong ties between the two fields, perhaps not yet sufficiently well examined. A simple example may help to illustrate the point: the distribution of rational points on a projective variety depends heavily on its geometric properties, and in many interesting cases counting methods based on harmonic analysis make these effects visible and explain them. In the opposite direction, analytic methods are often the only currently available tool to establish seemingly purely algebraic or geometric facts, such as a local-to-global principle.
