Functionalized Surfaces for Improved Biocompatibility of Titanium Alloys The behaviour of dental and orthopedic titanium implants as regards implant tissue interaction is primarily related to the surface properties, with both surface topography and surface chemistry as important engineering factors. In the joint project, a new generation of titanium implant surfaces both structurally modified (electrochemical topography) or biologically functionalized (attachment of selective oligopeptides) will be developed in order to stimulate specific cell attachment and growth and to get optimum response to the biological environment. In this research the implant surfaces will be characterized by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques combined by ex-situ XPS surface analysis. A first step is the characterization of polished titanium alloys in solutions of different pH with and without biological compounds in order to get a reference point for the further study of structurally and biologically modified surfaces. Long term behaviour and the performance of the systems is studied in-vitro by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) allowing to follow changes in film thickness. Comparative evaluation is performed by the project partners in in-vitro tests with cell cultures.
