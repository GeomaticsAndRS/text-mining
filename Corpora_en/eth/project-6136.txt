Investigation of the Properties of Tertiary Clay from Northern Bohemiawith the Aim of Using this Clay as a Protective Barrier in Landfills The tertiary sediments in northern Bohemia are made up of a thick layer of tertiary clay and brown coal. The coal has been extracted through both underground and surfacing mining techniques. The aim of this research project is an investigation into whether the tertiary clay is suitable for use as a landfill barrier. Landfilling of waste is possible in the excavated spaces underground, as well as in newly constructed landfills. This research project will be carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Geotechnical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague. Geotechnical and clay mineralogical properties of the clay will be investigated in the laboratories of both institutes.
