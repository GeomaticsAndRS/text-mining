Calnex: Quantifying the exchange of carbon and nutrients between the coastal and open seas: A comparative modeling study of the California and Canary Current Systems Here we propose to investigate the exchange of carbon and nutrients between the EBUS and the open ocean and the net role of the EBUS on the large-scale cycling of carbon and nutrients by using two newly developed setups of the Regional Oceanic one for the Canary Current System and the Atlantic Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) U Basin, and one for the California Current System and the Pacific Ocean Basin. These setups permit us to overcome the traditional limitation associated with either regional or global/basin-scale models, as they have the required eddy-resolving resolution in the nearshore regions of the EBUS and the whole basin coverage needed to investigate the open coastal-ocean exchange processes. Using these models as well as the available observations , we will investigate the following key hypotheses: i) The coastal ocean, and especially EBUS represents an integral part of the global closure of the nutrient and carbon cycle due to intense shelf open ocean exchanges; ii) the nutrients and carbon exported laterally from the EBUS represent a substantial part of the open ocean nutrient and carbon budgets, especially in the subtropical gyres where they fuel respiration and productivity; iii) shelf-extent and eddy activity in the EBUS control the extent to which nutrients and carbon returning from the thermocline/deep ocean are retained in the nearshore region or exported to the open ocean;. By comparing the results from the two EBUS and their adjacent ocean basins, we can optimally test and evaluate these hypotheses, as these two systems differ substantially with regard to their topography, mean state, and sensitivity to perturbations. The assessment of these hypotheses will permit us to make substantial progress toward our long-term goal, i.e., the development of a parameterization of coastal ocean biogeochemical processes for global Earth System Models.
