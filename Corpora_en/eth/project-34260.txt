SCCER - Storage of Thermal Energy The storage of thermal energy for electricity generation is based on the concept of advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage. The heat contained in compressed air can be stored and subsequently expanded in a turbine to drive a generator during periods of high demand. This so-called advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES) can reach efficiencies of at least 70 and is therefore competitive with pumped hydroelectric storage. The AACAES concept with temperature and pressure ranges of about 500-600 rC and 10-60 bars will be considered. In collaboration with Airlight Energy Ltd. And ALACAES SA, the addition of encapsulated phase-change materials (PCM) will be investigated to increase the capacity and performance of an existing sensible thermal-energy storage (TES) system based on a packed bed of rocks. This existing system is novel in its use of an unused tunnel as a high-pressure reservoir of the cooled air. It is therefore well suited to SwitzerlandSs unused tunnels and military caverns and extensive tunnel-building expertise.
