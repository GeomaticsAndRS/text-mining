Automated image orientation and point cloud generation with high resolution panoramic images We seek to enable automated feature extraction, image orientation and single image measurement based on ultra-high resolution panoramic images. We seek to expand photogrammetric measurement software for ultra-high resolution panoramas. This includes accurate and efficient methods for automated feature extraction, image orientation and single image measurement. A high accuracy point cloud engine shall be created. In parallel, a new camera motor for precise pixel registration and a new storage solution for high resolution image data will be developed.
