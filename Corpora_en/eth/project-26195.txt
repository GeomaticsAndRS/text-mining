CVD synthesis of graphene Graphene can serve as a novel building block of nanoscience today. For the future nanotechnology applications, CVD synthesis of graphene is very important. In this project, we will develop a reliable method of synthesizing mono- and multiple layers of graphene on metal substrates.
