Biotransformation of elemental selenium to bioavailable seleno-compounds by the gut microbiota using in vitro colonic fermentation systems Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for both humans and animals where it is incorporated into various enzymes. The aim of the project is to characterize the biotransformation of forms of elemental selenium and impacts on gut microbiota in advanced in vitro gut fermentation models.
