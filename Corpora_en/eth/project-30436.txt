Long-Range planning of Logistics capacities in the process industry The pharmaceutical industry has to tackle several challenges: The service level at the patient has utmost priority and therefore a high reliability is of crucial importance. At the same time, process changes need a long time due to e.g. regulatory requirements or Good Manufacturing Practices. The pharmaceutical industry has to tackle several challenges: The service level at the patient has utmost priority and therefore a high reliability is of crucial importance. At the same time, process changes need a long time due to e.g. regulatory requirements or Good Manufacturing Practices. In addition, uncertainties hamper a reliable forecasting. This uncertainty is influenced by the maturity of the product: It is difficult to estimate the capacities of a drug being in the R&D stage and getting easier when dealing with a more mature product having stable demand. Motivation: Consequently, planning of logistics capacities in the pharmaceutical industry is exposed to several conflicting goals and constraints: Providing reliable capacities has highest priority and at the same time changes in capacities might take several years and are difficult to forecast. Using a systematic and holistic procedure is expected to improve the current situation considerably. Objectives: The aim of this research project is to develop a holistic procedure for reliable capacity planning in the process industry addressing the before mentioned challenges. Requirements for a tool enhancing the transparency throughout the network will also be developed. The work will be verified and validated within a case study for a pharmaceutical company.
