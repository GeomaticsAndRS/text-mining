Viscous flow heat transfer in porous media The goal: Quantitative analysis of the free, forced and mixed convection heat transfer from and to a solid surface adjacent to a fluid saturated porous medium. Results: The heat transfer coefficient for free, forced and mixed convection boundary layer flows in a vertical porous layer has been calculated by exact analytic methods for the steady and unsteady regimes of the flow. Both plane (thermal insulation of a building facade) and cylindrical (insulation of hot water ducts) geometries have been considered. The main focus of the research was the effect of the internal friction of the fluid (viscous dissipation) on the heat and fluid flow in porous medium. It has been shown that as an effect of heat released by viscous dissipation, the usual equivalence of the free and mixed convection flows over an upward projecting hot plate and its downward projecting cold counterpart gets broken. This results in essential differences between the wall heat fluxes from and to a wall in the up- and downflow cases, respectively. While over a cold isothermal downward projecting vertical surface in the porous medium a strictly parallel free can arise, over the upward projecting plane convection flow (the Sasymptotic ¸ dissipation profileT) surface such a flow is not possible. It has also been shown that the thermal far field boundary conditions usually applied to forced and mixed convection problems in the porous medium literature lost their validity if the effect of viscous dissipation can not be neglected. The results of this research project have been reported in 20 papers published in refereed international journals (Internat. J. Heat Mass Transfer, Transport in Porous Media, J. of Porous Media, Heat and Mass Transfer, Fluid Dynamics Research, J. of Engineering Mathematics) as well as in Handbook of Porous Media (Marcel Dekker, New York, 2005).
