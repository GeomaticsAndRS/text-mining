Quantifying biofilms structure using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and quantitative image analysis Microbial interactions in biofilms depend on spatial organization of microorganisms within the biofilm and on mass transport of substrates and products in the system. Novel tools for imaging biofilm structure at different scales are being developed and combined with quantitative image analysis.
