Protection of and Influences on the Environment of Converters Using FastSwitching Devices The higher switching frequencies of modern high-power semiconductor devices (e.g. IGBTs) allow more flexibility in the design of power electronic systems (e.g. lower current ripple in machines). The increased switching speeds have other serious effects such as transient insulation stress within the power module and drive circuit as well as motor winding stress. Noisy switching signals can result in command errors, and may also cause power system failure. With the Interference Phase Concept (IPC), these command errors can be eliminated. High dI/dt is responsible for the stress of the free-wheeling diode within the power module. The dV/dt and dI/dt values can be limited by using passive components in the power circuit, but the use of such circuitry is bulky and expensive. Another way to reduce these values is to slow down the device (e.g. increasing the gate resistance), resulting in augmented switching losses. Our approach to limit the dV/dt and dI/dt values is to introduce a control loop which influences only the gate signal of the power switch. With this method, no additional elements are necessary in the power circuit, the impedance of the drive circuit can remain as low as desired, and the increase in switching losses will remain reasonably small. This approach has been verified theoretically in current research.
