Petersen, W.P.: Approximate FFT using hyperbolic star limits on k-space coefficients Only a few Fourier modes may be necessary to get a good representation of multi-dimensional periodic functions, for example hyperbolic star approximations. We are designing algorithms for such approximations and testing classes of functions for which this is useful. Often in the numerical solutions of partial differential equations and other simulation of physical systems, only a few Fourier modes are needed to get a good representation of multi-dimensional periodic functions. One approach is to use a hyperbolic star approximation, discussed in V.N. Temlyakov's mongraph on Approximations of Functions of Bounded Mixed Derivative . We are continuing work on hyperbolic star FFT approximations for symmetric transformations.
