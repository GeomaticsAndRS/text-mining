In-situ sensing tools for assessing rapid phytoplankton dynamics New sensor systems are developed with the goal to analyse relevant chemical parameters (nutrients, carbon system) which can trigger blooms of toxic cyanobacteria. The interdisciplinary projects applies new sensor systems for high resolution measurements on a lake platform.
