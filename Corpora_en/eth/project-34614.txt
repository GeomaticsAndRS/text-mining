On the Computational Security of Distributed Storage Systems We study the secrecy of distributed storage systems for passwords. Assuming that the encoder describes a password using several hints, which she stores in different locations, we quantify how hard it is for a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper to reconstruct the password.
