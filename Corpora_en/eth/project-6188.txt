Dynamic Analysis of Nail Penetration The work, a joint project with Hilti AG, Schaan/FL, was supported financially by the Swiss government's Commission for Advancement of Scientific Research (KWF) . Its aim was the development of a special-purpose computer program for the numerical simulation of nail penetration processes. With this successful fastening technology of the Hilti AG hardened steel nails are driven through the sheet(s) to be fastened into a supporting plate using explosive powder. The program deals with the axisymmetric two-dimensional case using ring-shaped elements for modelling the nail, the supporting plate and the sheet(s) to be fastened. The dynamic problem is solved by means of an explicit integration scheme using very short time steps. The material nonlinearities are treated by a new method which allows for the very large strains that are developed during nail penetration. In all three media, i.e. nail, sheet and supporting plate, elastic-viscoplastic material behaviour was assumed. A new algorithm for determining the contact forces, including frictional forces, acting on the gliding surfaces was developed. The program has an excellent user interface and is being variously applied in the development department of the project's industrial partner, Hilti AG.
