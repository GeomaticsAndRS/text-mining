The phasing of tropical cyclones and midlatitude flow features during extratropical transition This project provides a comprehensive climatology of the phasing of tropical cyclones to midlatitude flow features and lead to an improved basic understanding of the physical processes that determine the downstream impact of extratropical transition, using ICON simulations and ECMWF analyses.
