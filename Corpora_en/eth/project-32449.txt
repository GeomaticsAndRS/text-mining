Impact of Ionosphere Activities onto GNSS Signal during Approach and Landing with GBAS During the approach and landing of aircrafts, the integrity of the positioning results using differential GPS may be influenced by the residual ionosphere errors. This project attempts to evaluate the residual ionosphere errors and gradients under different ionosphere scenarios for the Swiss region
