Impact of Ionosphere Activities onto GNSS Signal during Approach and Landing with GBAS During the approach and landing of aircrafts, the integrity of the positioning results using differential GPS may be influenced by the residual ionosphere errors. This project attempts to evaluate the residual ionosphere errors and gradients under different ionosphere scenarios for the Swiss region In this project the single-differenced residual ionosphere errors and the spatial gradients for the slant and vertical ionospheric delays are evaluated and bounded for the Swiss region. The data of swisstopoSs Automated GNSS Network for Switzerland (AGNES) over 15 years (from 1999 to 2013) are processed using the double-difference phase observations. With resolved ambiguities the single-differenced ionosphere residuals (and gradients) are computed using the geometry-free linear combination imposing e.g. an epoch-wise zero-mean condition on the residuals. The zero-mean condition is corrected with the global Center of Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) ionosphere model. The slant ionospheric gradients are compared with the Conterminous United States (CONUS) ionospheric anomaly threat model. The overbounding vertical gradients are calculated over 15 years. The Bernese GNSS Software and Matlab are used for this project.
