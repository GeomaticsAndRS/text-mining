Optically Controlled Optical Space Switches All-optical space switches allow to switch data signals from port-to-port by means of an optical control signal. These devices are expected to play an important role in future telecommunication networks and in data processing due to their high speed switching characteristics (<10 ps). A monolithic integrated all-optical space switch exploiting gain and refractive index dynamics has been realized. Two optical amplifiers in a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) configuration allow a signal (Pin) to be spatially switched between two output ports (P$_{x}$and P$_{=}$) using an optical control signal (P$_{C}$) coupled into one of the semiconductor amplifiers (SOA's) by means of a multi-mode interference (MMI)-coupler. The control signal induces a refractive index change in one SOA changing the phase relation between the two data-signals in the MZI-branches. Their interference in the output MMI produces a switching from one port to the other. A first demonstration of packet switching has been performed. For the signal we used a periodic sequence of Return-to-Zero (RZ) bits with one bit guard bands at a rate of 1.250 Gb/s. A simultaneously counter-propagating control (pump) signal was synchronized in order to switch the packets from the cross to the bar state.
