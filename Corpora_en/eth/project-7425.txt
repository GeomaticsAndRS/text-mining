REAL-TIME EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN APPLIED TO 3-D HIGH-RESOLUTION DIRECT-CURRENT RESISTIVITY SURVEYS Delineation of complex three-dimensional (3-D) structures using geophysical techniques is a challenging task, limited conceptually by the physics of the methods. Restrictions on resolution are also imposed by logistical constraints that may limit deployment of sensors in inaccessible areas and by the limited number of data that can be affordably collected. Achieving an acceptable balance between information content and costs requires an appreciation of how acquiring incremental new data might benefit our understanding of the earth. Some initial information on the subsurface is required before designing an optimized survey layout. However, acquiring subsurface information is also the objective of the survey to be conducted. One solution to this chicken-and-eggT problem is to couple data acquisition and data analysis by implementing a real-time experimental design strategy. An initial sparse direct-current resistivity data set is recorded with a standard electrode configuration. 3-D-Inversions of these data provide initial resistivity estimates of the subsurface. On the basis of these estimates, suitable four-point configurations that increase the information content may then be determined. Measurements using the selected four-point configurations and subsequent inversions provide an improved 3-D resistivity model. If the updated model differs significantly from the initial one, additional four-point recordings may be necessary to constrain further the resistivity structure. This would require an additional cycle. The iterative process stops  data acquisition - data analysis - experimental designT when the model updates become negligibly small. A new acquisition and processing system has been designed and built to meet the objectives of this technique.
