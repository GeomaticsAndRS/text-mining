Plasma Etching Today, state-of-the-art integrated circuit manufacture depends on the mass replication of tightly controlled, micron-sized features in a variety of materials. Plasma etching has become central to this process because it is the only current technology that can do this job efficiently and with high yield. At our Institute a variety of equipment for the plasma etching of optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC) is available. For the etching of III-V semiconductor compounds with high etching rate we use a magnetron enhanced reactive ion etching system (MIE). The magnetron allows a plasma at lower pressures than with conventional reactive ion etchers and gives raise to less damage of the samples due to ion bombardment. The definition of InP based waveguides and optical switch structures is done in a conventional reactive ion etching (RIE) system. The plasma etching processes are based on mixtures of the gases H$_{2}$, CH$_{4}$and Ar. Process parameters as gas flows, chamber pressure, RF power density are optimized in order to achieve a high selectivity to the mask materials and a good homogeneity. Etch depth variations as low as \pm1.5% have been achieved over a 2-inch wafer. The same type of system is used for the dry etching of Ti and SiO$_{x}$layers using fluorine chemistry. These layers are used as mask material that are capable to withstand high temperatures. The etching of optical silica waveguides is done on the same system. In addition we have the capability to etch polyimide, PMMA or to ash organic residues with an oxygen plasma. New dry etching processes were successfully developed in 1995 that replace processes using the environmental critical gases Cl$_{2}$and CCl$_{2}$_{2}$.
