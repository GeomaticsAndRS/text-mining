Toyota - 3D reconstruction The Toyota project focuses on passive 3D reconstruction from a stereo vi- deo sequence. Special focus lies on the 3D reconstruction of poorly textured indoor environments. The Toyota project is a joint project with the KU Leuven, aimed at developing the computer vision software for a mobile robot, equipped with a stereo camera head. The division at ETH focuses on the 3D reconstruction of the environment of the robot. Special attention is given to the reconstruction of indoor environments. Untextured environments aggravate the reconstruction using traditional dense stereo approaches. To still obtain a reconstruction, additional information, such as coplanarity is introduced. Line features, abundant in architectural scenes, can be used as basis for this. This project investigates and refines existing approaches of the various subparts needed for the reconstruction. This covers tracking of lines over a video sequence, pose estimation algorithms for the relative localisation of the robot, and bundle adjustment for improving the reconstruction, among others. So far, an improved version of a feature detector--SURF--has been published, and further papers on 3D reconstruction and pose estimation are in the pipeline.
