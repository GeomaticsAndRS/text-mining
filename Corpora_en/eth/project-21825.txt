Solar Receiver Development for an Electricity Generation System Project aimed at the design, fabrication, testing, modeling & validation, and optimization of a solar receiver coupled with ALESs trough concentrator, for a Rankine-based electricity generation system. The project encompasses the following phases: Measurements of the solar flux at the 1) Experimental Characterization of Solar Concentrator U focal plane will be performed on-site and used to validate the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation model. A lab-scale solar receiver prototype will be designed and 2)Receiver Design and Construction U fabricated for an input solar power of 1 kW. The peripheral equipment such as the heat transfer fluid circuit system will be integrated to the receiver. The solar receiver will be tested at ETHSs High-Flux Solar Si3)Experimental Demonstration U mulator and its performance will be evaluated according to the solar-to-heat thermal efficiency. A 2nd experimental campaign is to be performed with a 50m-length pilot receiver at Biasca. The governing continuity, fluid flow, and 4)Receiver Modeling, Validation, and Optimization U energy equations will be formulated and solved by applying CFD and Monte-Carlo numerical techniques. Validation will be accomplished by comparing with experimental data obtained with the 1 kW prototype receiver at ETH and with the pilot (50-m length) receiver at Biasca. A parametric study will be carried out for optimizing the design and operation of a solar system for maximum thermal efficiency.
