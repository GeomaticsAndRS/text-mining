Using large scale facilities to study the structure of heterogeneous catalysts Using large-scale facilities to study the structure of catalysts under in situ conditions during synthesis and catalytic reaction enables the determination of structure - performance relations. We aim at understanding the functioning of a catalyst and the design of better and new ones.
