On the Nature of the Human Mind Just as today's notion of nature is not as simple and uniform as the Cartesian notion of the body used to be, today's notion of the human mind has all but lost the simplicity and uniformity that was evident to Descartes. The notion of the human mind is a general term that relates to a variety of qualitatively different phenomena. Much as microphysical phenomena cannot be duplicated on a macrophysical level, conscious phenomena in all likelihood cannot be duplicated by machine.
