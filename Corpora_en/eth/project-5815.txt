Physiology of Acetic Acid Bacteria Citrate synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) catalyzes the first reaction of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and is important for carbon assimilation and for energy generation. Recently, the gene (aarA) encoding citrate synthase of Acetobacter aceti was reported to be involved in expression of acetic acid resistance in this organism (Fukaya et al.: 1993, J. Ferment. Bioeng. Vol. 76, 270-275). Acetobacter is in contrast to Gluconobacter able to oxidize acetate further to carbon-dioxide and water. Citrate synthase was purified from the acidophilic bacterium A. europaeus to electrophoretical homogeneity. The specific activity was 228 units/mg of protein during the exponential ethanol-oxidation growth phase. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 280 kDa and is a hexamer with a subunit size of 46 kDa. Reaction rates with the purified enzyme were hyberbolic functions of both acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. The apparent Km values were 20 mM for oxaloacetate and 51 mM for acetyl-CoA. The purified citrate synthase of Gluconobacter oxydans has a subunit size of 46 kDa and the Km values were 20 mM for oxaloacetate and 27 mM for acetyl-CoA. Unlike citrate synthase from other Gram-negative bacteria, the activity of the enzymes were inhibited by ATP, slightly enhanced by ADP and not effected by NADH. Acetate caused activation of the enzymes. From the characterization data, it is obvious that the enzymes play a central role in supply of sufficient ATP to protect the cells against accumulation of acetic acid (M. Sievers, M. Stöckli, M. Teuber: 1997, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. Vol. 146, 53-58).
