The T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a second generation, long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with the main goal to discover the transformation of muon neutrinos into electron produced at the neutrinos. A high intensity muon neutrino beam, the first so called Ssuperbeam ¸ T, J-PARC laboratory near Tokai in Japan, is sent over a distance of 295 km across Japan towards the existing SuperKamiokande (SK) detector. SK is a 50 kton water Cerenkov detector, and is used to measure the flux of arriving neutrinos. With the near detector ND280, located only 280 m downstream of the proton target for the neutrino beam, the flux of neutrinos is measured before they could oscillate into a different flavor. The flux extrapolated from ND280 to the SK detector is compared to the measured flux at SK. Especially SK is used to search for the appearance of electron neutrinos in the beam of muon neutrinos, a transition which was never observed so far. T2K is also measuring with high precision the disappearance of muon neutrinos, i.e., the deficit of muon neutrinos arriving at SK compared to the expectation without oscillation. This will lead to much improved values of the oscillation parameters. In case the muon to electron neutrino oscillation is found, it is planned to search for CP-violation in the lepton sector in a future second phase of the experiment. The experiment has started data taking in 2010.
