Snubberless Series Connection of Insulated-Gate-Bi-po-lar-Transistors The novel principle of active gate-controlled-voltage-balancing allows fast high-power/high-voltage semiconductor-switches to be realised. The switches with operating voltages of several kilovolts use series connected Insulated-Gate-Bipolar-Transistors. An experimental IGBT-switch was built with a switching power of 1 MVA, and the proposed method for static and transient balancing of the collector-emitter-voltages was tested. The new approach for active gate-controlled voltage-balancing is a combination of different methods for transient and static balancing which controls the collector-emitter-voltages of all IGBTs to equal values. The control algorithms and gate-drive circuits were tested successfully in a water-cooled experimental high-voltage inverter-leg at 3.5 kV and 300 A. All controllers for the three IGBTs are implemented in a Digital Signal Processor with switching frequencies up to 10 kHz. In addition, new gate-controlled commutation-speed limitation methods were investigated and tested. The dv/dt-control method allows the reduction of the transient voltage stress of converter and load, while the gate-controlled di/dt-limitation method protects the commutation-sensitive free-wheeling-diodes against damage during turn-on. Both control methods were implemented in an experimental gate drive circuit and were evaluated in the experimental snubberless high-voltage IGBT-switch.
