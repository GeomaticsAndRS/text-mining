Dealumination and realumination of zeolites The majority of zeolites, which are applied as catalysts in industrial processes, have undergone post-synthesis modifications of some kind. Dealumination, the removal of aluminium from the framework, is generally applied to increase hydrothermal stability and to generate mesopores, which help in overcoming diffusion barriers in the zeolite micropores. Often it would be desirable to reintroduce some aluminium atoms into the framework after dealumination in order to increase the number acid sites. Eventually, such reinsertion techniques could even enable us to place the aluminium at those positions in the lattice where they are most useful. The current focus of our work is on the de- and realumination of zeolite beta (BEA), which has a very flexible framework and allows reversible changes of the aluminium coordination. 27Al-MQMAS NMR, a strongly emerging 2-dimensional solid-state NMR technique, is used to characterize the materials. A potential application of the modified BEAs is the nitration of aromatics (e.g., toluene). BEA is the only selective zeolite catalyst for this reaction.
