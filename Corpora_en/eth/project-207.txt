Mathematical Methods in Financial Management (NCCR-Proposal: Financial Valuation and Risk Management We research quantitative aspects of Financial Risk Management, especially the applications of Extreme Value Theory and Copula modelling. Special attention is given to the modelling of Operational Risk in the context of Basel II (for banking) and Solvency 2 (for insurance). As part of the overall NCCR project, we (Paul Embrechts, Valerie Chavez-Demoulin) concentrate on applications of Extreme Value Theory and Copula Modelling to quantitative risk management, mainly with applications to the financial sector in mind. Specific questions investigated include: - Modelling of Operational Risk: extreme qauntile (VaR) estimamtion in the presence of heavy-tailed (Pareto-type) loss distributions and non-staionarity of the loss frequency. - Aggregation of dependent risk processes (with Dr Johanna Neslehova, RiskLab). - Testing of EVT based models for Market Risk (the Riskometer).
