All Optical Associative Memory Using Photorefractive Crystals Associative memories are storage devices in which an input set of data recalls another set of associated data. In particular, they have the property that an incomplete or distorted image can be used to retrieve the complete and correct version of an image that is most similar to the input. We store the information as a set of angularly multiplexed holograms in a photorefractive LiNbO$_{3}$crystal. All the holograms are recorded in a cycle which is repeated many times until all of them have equal diffraction efficiencies (incremental recording schedule). For read-out a partial or distorted version of a stored image modulates the object beam that addresses the previously recorded holograms and a set of reconstructed reference beams is generated. These beams pass through a saturable absorber, are phase-conjugated using another photorefractive KNbO$_{3}$crystal in a degenerate four-wave mixing geometry, and retrace their paths to the hologram passing through the saturable absorber again. This double-pass through the absorber greatly enhances the difference of intensity between the beams, thus only the strongest reference beam that belongs to the most similar stored image survives. Due to the strong angular selectivity of the thick hologram only the stored image which is most similar to the input is reconstructed and observed in the output plane. One serious problem encountered by associative memories is to distinguish between enclosed images, e.g. I and H, or between images which have a large difference in their overall transmittance. We developed a storage scheme for amplitude modulated images that eliminates this problem in nonlinear holographic associative memories. We may conclude that a weighted storage method allows the discrimination of correlated patterns in nonlinear holographic associative memories.
