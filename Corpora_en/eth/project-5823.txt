Spray-Chilling of Multiphase Systems The product which is obtained by atomising a melt into a chamber at a temperature below the chilling point of the educt is a crystalline powder. The first step in this research project was to develop a special spraying tower, in which the atomised liquid drops are converted within a counter-current or parallel stream of cold dry air into a crystalline powder. This was done in such a way that the process parameters (temperature, airstream velocities, spraying pressure, nozzle type) could be adjusted in accordance with the temperature dependent viscosity, density and surface tension as well as the chilling point and the melting enthalpy of the educt, with the aim to obtain the desired quality of the powder product. In a second part, different single phase polymorphous fat systems are atomised in a way to obtain a fine crystalline powder with defined particle size distribution and caloric properties. The question of the relation between process data and characteristic data of the melt is investigated in order to determine the parameters which most effect the properties of the product (X50 (mean particle size)= f(Re-number, We-number); mbi (fraction of polymorphous structure type bi) = f(temperature, Nu-number, residence time)). For the basic investigations on the dependency of heat transfer (Nu- number) and air flow conditions around the atomised droplets (Re-number), which generate additional heat by crystallisation, a special tower for single droplet measurements is developed. The application of a spray chilled fat powder as seeding agent for the pre-crystallisation of chocolate is tested. In a third step of this project, a method for compacting different chilled crystalline bulk goods will be developed. Multiphase systems shall be spray chilled and compressed in a way to obtain storage-stable solid or semi-solid products.
