Pacemaker safety Continuous efforts have been put into the investigation of pacemaker sa- fety in the MRI environment. Different interactions have to be evaluated. The goal of this project is an MR compatible pacemaker. Pacemakers and defibrillators implanted in patients are considered contraindicative for MRI/MRS investigations. Due to safety concerns, pacemaker patients cannot profit from the diagnostic advantages offered by MRI. Previous research at this institution has already elucidated potential hazards of pacemakers and defibrillators in an MRI environment. It was demonstrated that reed-switches fail to operate properly at static magnetic fields above 200 mTesla. Thus, pacemakers cannot be considered safe in the MRI environment in general. Therefore, it remains to be clarified whether parts of the body can be safely assessed using MRI under specific conditions concerning the positions of the pacemaker and the pacemaker leads within the magnet and MRI sequence types used. Detailed research comprises investigations for a better understanding of heating effects of pacemaker leads. Further steps are planned to elaborate on the potential risks of heart stimulation by induced voltages from gradient switching and radio-frequency fields.
