Particulate antigen delivery systems combined with photosensitizer and light for cytosolic targeting and stimulation of MHC class I T-cell responses Cytotoxic CD8 T-cell responses are crucial in the fight against cancer and infectious diseases. Here, particulate vaccine formulations are developed that contain antigens and photosensitizer to afford cytosolic antigen delivery and stimulation of MHC class I T-cell responses.
