Computational modelling of designed variant prion proteins the summary will be added later Computational modeling of designed variant prion proteins Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are infectious neurodegenerative diseases occurring in humans and animals, with invariably lethal outcome. The onset of a TSE is associated with a conformational rearrangement of the prion protein (PrP). The cellular form observed in healthy tissues, PrPC, is thereby transformed into an aggregated isoform that forms typical amyloid structures. My research team at the ETH Zürich has investigated the structural properties of a wide range of prion proteins from different species, and included a series of designed variant mouse PrPs into these studies. In collaboration with Prof. A. Aguzzi of the University of Zürich, transgenic mice are being generated which express variant mouse PrPs, and the behavior of the transgenic animals with regard to outbreak of TSEs and susceptibility to infection by foreign infectious brain homogenate is investigated. The presently described computational modeling project extends the scope of the project, which so far combined structural biology with in vivo mouse experiments. The computational modeling is pursued under the direction of Prof. Michele Parrinello of the USI by his graduate student Enrico Caldarulo, with participation of Dr. Alessandro Barducci of 2 the EPFL. With molecular dynamics simulations, the conformational plasticity of the 2U loop and the associated rate processes are investigated for a series of variant mouse PrPCs, which have also been the subject of the aforementioned structural studies by NMR and in vivo mouse experiments. This modeling project thus aims at revealing the structural nature of conformational exchange pathways, the effects of amino acid replacements, and the energetics associated with these processes.
