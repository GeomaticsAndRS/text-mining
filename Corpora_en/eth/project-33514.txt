Rockslide Characterization and Location with Regional Seismic Networks This project aims to create a comprehensive remote monitoring package to identify and classify rock slope failures in continuous seismic data within minutes after occurrence. This will facilitate creation of a centralized rockslide database in Switzerland. This project aims to create a comprehensive remote monitoring package to identify and classify rock slope failures in continuous seismic data within minutes after occurrence. This will facilitate creation of a centralized rockslide database in Switzerland, aiding future rockslide process research and allowing rapid assessment of potential secondary hazards. Our project is founded on a productive collaboration between the Engineering Geology group of ETH Zurich and the Swiss Seismological Service (SED), combining broad knowledge of rockslide processes and dynamics with expertise on seismic signal manipulation and extensive seismic infrastructure. Our project will contribute to several areas of rockslide seismicity research: 1) we will improve our ability to estimate basic rockslide parameters from remote seismic data, moving beyond single case histories or purpose-built seismic networks, 2) we will provide an automated system for remote rockslide detection and classification, able to operate on an existing continuous seismic data stream without manual input, and 3) we will use time-dependent source models to systematically explore the influence of specific rockslide event variables on seismic energy conversion and seismogram characteristics. Taken together, the results of our study offer a comprehensive system to remotely detect and characterize rockslide events, which working alongside existing earthquake monitoring routines may allow for rapid assessment of both primary and secondary rockslide hazards.
