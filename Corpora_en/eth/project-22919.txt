Vegetation-herbivory interactions in Tanzania; importance of N and P fluxes and stoichiometry This project is about the influence of large herbivores on nutrient cycling and distribution in humid savanna, Tanzania. How do herbivores affect grass-tree coexistence and stability of savannas. We study (1) nutrient fluxes, (2) grass-tree competition, (3) decomposition of dung and plant litter.
