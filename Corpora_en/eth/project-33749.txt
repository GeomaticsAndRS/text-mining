IMPRESSIONS: Impact and risks of high-end climate change scenarios for forest ecosystems. It is becoming increasingly unlikely that we will meet the emissions targets necessary to keep climate change to less than 2 degrees. We are using a variety of forest models to assess how forests will respond to high-end climate change scenarios and how management can mitigate some of these impacts.
