Software tools for modeling, analysis and control of linear and hybrid systems. This project aims at developing efficient software tools for modeling, analysis and optimal control synthesis for constrained linear and hybrid systems. In order to utilize novel theoretical results in the field of optimal control of linear and hybrid systems in practice, efficient software tools are clearly needed to provide a good basis for computation. HYSDEL (HYbrid Systems DEscription Language) is a modeling tool that allows rapid prototyping of hybrid systems in Mixed Logical Dynamical and Piece-Wise Affine frameworks. It allows the user to semantically describe the behavior of hybrid systems by a set of statements in a programming language manner. Current research is focused at extending HYSDEL by adding support for vectorized variables, introducing new approaches for creating compositions of hybrid systems, and allowing to create models of hybrid systems visually using the Simulink/Stateflow environment. Multi-Parametric Toolbox (MPT) is a Matlab toolbox for computing explicit optimal and suboptimal feedback control laws for constrained linear and piece-wise affine systems. The toolbox offers a user-friendly interface to the latest achievements in the field of optimal control: starting from different performance objectives to the handling of systems with persistent additive and polytopic uncertainties. The ongoing work is focused on continuously extending the capabilities of the toolbox by incorporating the most recent results in related fields. ~ Detailed reports, documentation and download are available from http://control.ee.ethz.ch/hybrid/
