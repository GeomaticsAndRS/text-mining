SNF Acoustic emissions Accoustic emissions from progressive failures in snow and soil: Towards predictability of abrupt mass release We propose a framework for linking local failure in snow and soil preceding hazardous mass release with their measurable acoustic emission signatures. Relevant failure processes including: shearing, compression, fracturing, friction, root de-bonding, breakage of ice-crystals and cementing agents result in emission of measurable elastic waves. We propose to develop methodologies for improving in-situ monitoring and interpretation of acoustic emissions as markers of local failure events. Models for many interacting mechanical elements would be coupled with real-time statistical properties of acoustic emissions to assess the degree of susceptibility (criticality) to slope failure. To attain these goals we address the following scientific questions: (i) how can we identify and measure spatially distributed local failures, (ii) how can we relate a measured surrogate variable (e.g., acoustic signals) to the type and size of local failure, and (iii) can we improve predictions of time windows and locations of imminent mass release from real-time analyses of distributed acoustic emission signals. Results of this project should help close the gap between disciplines (acoustics and mechanics of abrupt failures in snow and soil), improve predictions of localized mass release events, and provide a better scientific basis for design of acoustically-based monitoring and early warning systems.
