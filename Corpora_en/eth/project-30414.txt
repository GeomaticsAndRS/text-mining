Experimental and numerical analyses of the hydro-mechanical behaviour of Opalinus Clay This project was initiated to systematically analyze the hydro-mechanical behavior of Opalinus Clay in the short- and long-term. A series of consolidated drained and undrained triaxial tests will be conducted to establish the undrained and drained strength, and stress-strain behavior. This projects aims to investigate the hydro-mechanical properties of Opalinus Clay utilizing a series of consolidated drained and undrained triaxial and creep tests. This tests will be used to establish reasonable drained and undrained shear strength and poro-elastic properties, and to develop a advanced constitutive law for numerical analyzes. Both, the constitutive law and the derived hydro-mechanical properties will be used to back-calculate existing mine-by experiments conducted at the Mont Terri Underground Research laboratory.
