Circuit Design: Coplanar V-Band Amplifier The goal of LESIT project 6.1 is to demonstrate mm-wave circuits using InP HEMT devices. Our project partner Telecom-PTT also requires low noise mm-wave amplifiers. The first step towards realising these goals was to develop the InP-HEMT technology, but recently efforts have been concentrated on circuit design, fabrication and test. Using our in-house InP HEMT technology several amplifiers and oscillators have been designed and fabricated. State of the art performance could be shown for single stage amplifiers: a gain of 9.1 dB at 64 GHz and a 20 GHz 3-dB bandwidth was measured. A two-stage variable gain amplifier yielded a peak gain of 25.7 dB at 48.5 GHz with a gain control range of 32 dB. The fabricated varactor tunable oscillator shows a tuning range of 6GHz at a center frequency of 59GHz, and can be injection locked. These circuits can be used for future integrated mm-wave receivers.
