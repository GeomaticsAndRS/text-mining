A Retrospective FE Hip Fracture Study Based on the AGES-RS Data The aim of this project is to address a key topic in osteoporosis research i.e.; what predisposes a hip to fracture? A large part of the effort is devoted to developing improved methods for experimental testing and in-silico simulations and validate them against retrospective cohort data. Previous studies in the literature have addressed the risk of hip fracture as a quasi-static structural problem. This applies for FE studies validated against experimental in-vitro test results, retrospective hip fracture FE studies validated against cohort data and experimental in-vitro studies where the applied loading rate in all previous work is lower than the loading rates that can result from a side-ways fall on the hip from standing. This assumption, however, has major limitations because it ignores important aspects of the subject specific nature of the impact event and can potentially explain why FEA based fracture risk prediction has not been found to have significantly superior predictive power than DEXA scores. First, consensus exists in the literature that the mechanical properties of bone are strain rate dependant. Second, although femoral specimens tested in-vitro in a side-ways fall configuration at quasi-static loading rate represent a statically determined structure (reaction forces independent of the mechanical properties of the femur), this does not hold true for dynamic problems. In other words when a mass is dropped on a femur supported in a side-ways fall configuration, the resulting force at the impact site depends on the mechanical properties of the femur. Third, due to the non-linear nature of the mechanical response of bone under impact the use of load-to-strength ratio, which is the only metric used in FE studies in the literature to distinguish between specimen at risk of fracture and specimens not at risk of fracture, may be suboptimal because this metric ignores the energy balance of the event.
