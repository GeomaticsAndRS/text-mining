Phytochemical and Biological Studies on Leonurus Species growing inTurkey Leonurus is a widespread genus of the family Labiatae which is represented by more than twenty species in the world flora. Five Leonurus species, namely L. cardiaca, L. glaucescens, L. quinquelobatus, L. marrubiastrum, and L. persicus are found in the flora of Turkey. Some Leonurus species have been used in the folk medicine in Europe and in Asia. In Turkey, Leonurus cardiaca is used for its cardiotonic, expectorant, euphoric effects and to provide constipatiory effects. According to recent pharmaco-chemical studies, estrogenic, uterotonic, antitumoral and antihypertensive effects as well as anti-platelet aggregation have been reported for Leonurus extracts or pure compounds obtained from plants of this genus. Chemically, this genus is known for its alkaloid components, but many other chemical constituents still remain uninvestigated or uncharacterized. The goal of this study is to investigate the Turkish Leonurus species mainly for their anti-platelet aggregation effects, in addition to other bioactivities, as well as the isolation and structure elucidation of the active chemical constituents. Since the taxonomy of this genus is very complex, this study may assist their chemotaxonomic classification. So far, petroleum ether and dichloromethane extracts of Leonurus persicus were analysed to yield sterols (\ss-sitosterol, stigmasterol), a flavone aglycone (genkwanin) and more than twenty labdane and seco-labdane diterpenes.
