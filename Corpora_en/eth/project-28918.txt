Understanding species limits: a comparative approach along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients Species ranges are determined by many interacting factors, including dispersal ability, biotic interactions, gene flow, and the availability of genetic variation. Comparing populations along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients will help to understand the relative importance of these factors.
