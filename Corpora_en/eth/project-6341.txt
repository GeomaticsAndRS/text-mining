Applied Vision Research - Medical Screening: Medical Information System People taking part in medical screenings must be informed about the aim of the screenings as well as about the test they are going to undergo. This enhances test performance in terms of validity and reliability of the results as well as in terms of the time taken to carry out the screening. The personal giving of information, e.g. by the medical doctor carrying out the screenings, would cancel the time saving advantage gained by informing the patients about the procedure before they are tested. A modular PC based information system is being built by means of which the above mentioned advantages are made possible. Due to the high level of usability of the information system, even people having little or no experience with PCs will be able to retrieve information about medical screenings they are about to undergo. The system is being developed for use at medical screenings where a large number of patients are screened as well as at individual practitioners.
