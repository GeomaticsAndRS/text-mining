Nutrient cycling and nutrient limitation in relation to productivity and species composition of plant communities Nutrient enrichment is an important threat to natural ecosystems because it may lead to eutrophication and species loss. I study relationships between environmental change, nutrient availabilities for plants, nutrient limitation, productivity and vegetation composition for the main nutrients: N, P and K. A main aim is to analyze the impact of the type of nutrient limitation on relationships between productivity and vegetation composition, including invasive and endangered plants, and how the type of limitation can be manipulated by nature management.
