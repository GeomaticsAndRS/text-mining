Short- and medium-range order in bulk metallic glasses studied via TEM and APT Detailed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) studies are performed to obtain information on short- and mediumrange order in metallic glasses. Possible phase separation and nanocrystal formation are studied via EDX spectroscopy in the STEM mode.
