High Performance Polarization Insensitive Bulk Ridge-Waveguide Semiconductor OpticalAmplifiers at 1.3Wavelength Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA's) at 1.3\gmm wavelength are attractive for transparent switching- and optical communication networks. Polarization insensitivity, low facet reflectivities and high saturation output powers are important issues for fiber system applications. We demonstrated a polarization insensitive fiber-to-fiber gain as high as 27dB using the bulk ridge-waveguide structure. The polarization sensitivity is within \pm0.5dB over the entire gain spectrum and the 0mA to 250mA operational current and 10\dgC to 50\dgC heat sink temperature ranges. The intrinsic noise figure is 6.3dB at the longer wavelength side of the 35nm gain bandwidth. The SOA is 10\dg tilted and SiO/Al$_{2}$_{3}$ antireflection coated to provide very low facet reflectivities of less than 3\md10$^{-6}$.
