Tunnel face stability and tunnelling induced settlements under transient conditions Understanding the behavior of medium permeability soils under the transient conditions prevailing around the advancing face is essential for construction safety and economy. We investigate the effect of advance rate on settlement and stability, as well as the standup time of the tunnel face.
