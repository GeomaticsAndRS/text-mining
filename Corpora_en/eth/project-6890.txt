Molecular Kinetics and Spectroscopy.Theory of IR-multiphoton Excitation of Polyatomic Molecules The quantum dynamics of IR-multiphoton excitation is simulated with the program package URIMIR developed by our group and extensions thereof. Master equations and simple approximations are used as well. The goal of these investigations is to improve our understanding of the excitation-reaction processes observed in experiments (preceding project) and to predict new experiments. Reviews: M.
