Fabrication and Evaluation of Carbon Nanotube Membranes for the Separation of Organic and Inorganic Micropollutants Limited access to clean water defines one of the global sustainability issues today. We will investigate interaction between pollutant molecules and carbon nanotube in order to assess scientific potential of a membrane made of the nanotube pores in safe provision of freshwater at all levels.
