Prohl, A.: Numerics of Nematic Liquid Crystals Phases of a liquid crystal (LC) are intermediate between liquid and solid phases; LCâ€™s are ordered fluids composed of elongated molecules that are either rod-or disk-like. It is this anisotropy which allows for applications in optical devices, like displays.
