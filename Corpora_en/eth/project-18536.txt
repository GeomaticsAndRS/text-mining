Machine Learning Approaches for Computational Neuroanatomy Goal of this project is to develop image processing and machine learning methods and algorithms to detect and classify neuroanatomical structures like neurons, dendrites and synapses in transmission electron microscopy images. In electron microscopy there is a great need for automated image processing in the field of image registration, detection and segmentation of structures. In this project we develop image processing and machine learning approaches for detection and classification of neurons from transmission electron microscopy images. In particular we want to extract neuronal structures like dendrites, boutons and synapses. The goal of this project is a 3D reconstruction of the brain in conjunction with the connectivity of neurons to get a better understanding of learning and remembering in the brain. This work is performed in collaboration with EMEZ and INI.
