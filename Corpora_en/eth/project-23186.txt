Disorder-induced phases in quantum magnets Chemical substitution is used to introduce bond randomness into low- dimensional quantum magnets, seeking to stabilize exotic quantum phases such as Bose and Mott glasses, Random Single phase and chiral liquids. Measurements are performed using neutron scattering and bulk techniques.
