Growth of Decagonal Quasicrystals Decagonal quasicrystals share structural properties of solids with periodic and quasiperiodic type of long-range order. They are periodic along the 10-fold symmetry axis and quasiperiodic in the plane perpendicular to it, thus offering the unique possibility for the study of properties of both periodically and quasiperiodically structured matter along different directions of one single sample. Decagonal quasicrystals exhibit unusually strong anisotropy of electrical and thermal transport properties, and also of the optical conductivity. Availability of large high-quality single grains is of prime importance for investigations of the anisotropic behaviour. For most intermetallic systems that contain a quasicrystalline phase, the equilibrium phase diagram is such that the quasicrystalline phase is the product of a peritectic solidification reaction between some of the hightemperature crystalline phases and the liquid. We have grown single grains of AlNiCo decagonal quasicrystals by slow solidification of the non-stoichiometric melt. The heat treatment of the arc-melted ingot was performed in an alumina crucibles that were placed inside an evacuated quartz tube. Single crystal x-ray and electron diffraction investigations revealed that grains, up to 4 mm in diameter and 8 mm in length, extracted from the ingot are highly ordered single quasicrystals with the S1 type of decagonal order. Our future research plans include detailed investigations of the low-temperature electronic and thermal properties of the Al-Ni-Co single quasicrystals. We also plan to study other systems that form decagonal phases.
