Taxonomy and phylogeny of Sphaerophragmium and selected rust fungi on Annonaceae Annonaceae are mostly small trees that occur in moist tropical forests. Some species have economic importance. A number of rust fungi (basidiomycetes, Uredinales) occur on Annonaceae as obligate parasites. In this project we focus on the rust genera Sphaerophragmium, Phakopsora and Dasyspora.
