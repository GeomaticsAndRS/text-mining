The Contribution of Urban Greenspace to Quality of Life Greenspace makes an essential contribution to the quality of life of urban citizens. However, the portfolio of greenspace is often a legacy of earlier decades. The objective of this EU-funded project is to develop methodologies (economic valuation methodologies, computer visualization, planning approaches and landscape ecology) to demonstrate a strategic approach to the planning and development of greenspace through the use of public participation.
