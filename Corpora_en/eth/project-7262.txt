Mobility and Differentiated Service in a Future IP Network (MobyDick) In order to continue to evolve 3rd Generation mobile and wireless infrastructure towards the Internet - targeting IST 2000 key action line IV 5.2 Terrestrial Wireless System and Networks -, the project Moby Dick will define, implement, and evaluate an IPv6-based mobility-enabled end-to-end QoS architecture starting from the current IETF's QoS models, Mobile-IPv6, and AAA framework. A representative set of interactive and distributed multimedia applications will serve to derive system requirements for the verification, validation, and demonstration of the Moby Dick architecture in a testbed comprising UMTS, 802.11 Wireless LANs, and Ethernet. In case the existing applications or the underlying architectures do not provide what is required, the necessary modification will be undertaken.
