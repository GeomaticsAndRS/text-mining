Photoaffinity Labeling of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Thymidine Kinasewith 8-Azidoadenosine Triphosphate Characterization of the ATP binding domain in Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1 TK) is aimed by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azidoadenosine triphosphate (8-azido-ATP). Exposure of HSV1 TK in the presence of 8-azido-ATP to irradiation with ultraviolet light resulted in a time-dependent covalent modification of the enzyme with a concomitant loss of catalytic activity. Specificity of labeling was indicated by the ability of 8-azido-ATP to serve as a co-substrate in the phosphorylation of thymidine. The modified protein was subjected to tryptic digestion, and the fragments labeled by the nucleotide analogue will be purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis of the labeled tryptic peptides is subsequently aimed in order to identify components of the binding pocket for the adenine moiety. Comparison of the identified sequences with the proposed 3D-model of the active-site of HSV1 TK will follow. The model has been constructed by computer-aided molecular modelling techniques and photoaffinity labeling will be used for experimental verification.
