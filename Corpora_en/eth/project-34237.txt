Generation of microcutting tools using advanced laser technologies Generation of microcutting tools by laser machining Laser cutting edge generation of carbide rotationally symmetric microcutting tools of 1 mm. State-of-the-art laser microtechnologies and ultrashort picosecond laser pulses will improve microcutting tool capabilities by optimising tool form and surface characteristics while minimising tolerance gap 5 µ m. Cutting tool performance will be evaluated.
