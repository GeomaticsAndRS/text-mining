Statistical physics We study phase transitions and thermodynamic/transport properties of dis- ordered (glassy) systems, e.g., spin glasses, structural glasses, glassy phases in vortex matter, random polymers. Disordered systems exhibit interesting thermodynamic and nonequilibrium properties relevant to the functionality of magnetic and superconducting systems. We have studied dirty elastic manifolds in the context of vortex matter physics and the properties of various types of glasses, such as spin, structural, and gauge glasses. Questions of interest are the basic understanding of the glass phase (droplet picture versus replica symmetry breaking, structural properties of the vortex glass phase), the thermodynamic properties of the glass transition (e.g., scaling laws and universality, entropy crisis in structural glasses), the influence of thermal and quantum fluctuations on the response properties of a glass (creep dynamics), the absence of the Almeida-Thouless line in short-range spin glasses, and the chaotic response to small perturbations in spin glasses. We make use of various analytical (replica approach, instantons, functional renormalization group) and numerical techniques (parallel tempering Monte Carlo and cluster algorithms). Recent interest is in the 1+1-dimensional random polymer problem, where we are studying various aspects, e.g., the (joint, longitudinal and transverse) free energy distribution function using replica analysis as well as instanton techniques (in the related Burgers problem), the exactly solvable (shifted) random force and random harmonic correlator approximations of the random potential problem, and a (properly regularized) perturbative analysis of the displacement correlator. Work in progress deals with the calculation of the free-energy distribution function for the 1+1-dimensional random polymer problem using replica theory, a mapping to quantum (attractive) bosons, and the exact calculation of the many-particle propagator using a Bethe Ansatz solution.
