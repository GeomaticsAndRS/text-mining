Projects of the Computer Engineering Group An up-to-date list of projects, project descriptions, results and publications can be found on the home page of the research group: http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/~ tec . Our research and teaching activities concentrate on design, engineering methodologies, and tools for embedded systems. We are developing models and methods - leading to optimal design of ICT systems, - making best use of available hardware and software technologies while - obeying boundary conditions in terms of cost and performance. In particular we are active in the modeling and simulation of embedded systems, in the synthesis of hardware/software systems, in multiobjective optimization via evolutionary strategies, and in the area of mobile information and communication systems.
