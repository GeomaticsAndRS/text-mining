Measurement Technology Passive Taggingsystems using Microwaves. In automatic operating, processing or tolling systems it is sometimes necessary to be able to identify objects accurately and simply. One solution to this problem is to place electronic tags onto the objects. Such tags have to be cheap and maintenance-free. Only tags which need no external energy supply and do not contain batteries can fulfil these requirements. In this project identification tags based on electronic microwave transponders that are remotely powered from the reader are being investigated. The following topics are of special interest: the transfer of microwave energy to serve the tag, different kinds of reader antennas that produce a long range of a high power density, the modulation and coding of information for transmission to and from the tag as well as problems arising from the use of several readers and many tags simultaneously. The goal of the project is to provide a foundation for the later industrial use and development of microwave tagging systems. A feasibility study of the maximum range of such tags has been made, and some of the results were confirmed experimentally. Several prototype tags operating in different frequency ranges were fabricated and measured. A demonstration of a complete tagging system operating at 5.8 GHz has been developed. The useful range was about 7 meters measured with a 25 cm$^{2}$tag. Further work will concentrate on the transfer of microwave energy, low profile antennas for the reader and systems in the 24GHz range.
