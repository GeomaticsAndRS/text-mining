Ultra-shallow seismic reflection techniques for investigating fractured crystalline rock and coastal environments The goal over the next few years is to perfect the ultra-shallow seismic reflection method for mapping fractures, faults and other disturbances in crystalline rocks and coastal regions. Specific technical developments required to extract maximum information from the ultra-shallow seismic reflection
