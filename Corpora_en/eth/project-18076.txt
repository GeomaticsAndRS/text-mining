Mid-Cretaceous greenhouse climate and opening oceanic gateways: in search for feedbacks between tectonics, climate and oceanography Cretaceous climate archives contain a record of repeated greenhouse pulses interrupted by episodes of cool climate. We will investigate how oceans responded to most extreme climate perturbations in the Early Cretaceous and if changes in the ocean chemistry left their imprint in climate records.
