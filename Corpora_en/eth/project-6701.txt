Bootstrap for Dependent Data The bootstrap is a simulation-based method to estimate standard errors of a statistical procedure and to construct confidence intervals for unknown parameters or functions. With dependent data, the classical bootstrap does not work anymore and other approaches are needed. The research project includes the following: (i) construction of efficient sieve bootstrap schemes for general stationary time series; (ii) convergence rates of time series bootstraps for variance and distribution estimation; (iii) data-driven tuning of time series bootstraps; (iv) comparison and validation of sieve and block bootstraps for time series; (v) extensions to spatial processes.
