Plant-pathogen-insect interactions in cranberry This project aims to elucidate the constitutive and induced defenses of cranberry plants (Vaccinium macrocarpon) against insect herbivores and insect-vectored pathogens, and to understand how these defenses have been altered over the course of domestication (cranberry is a recently domesti~ years; furthermore, populations of the wild cated plant species, having been cultivated for only 150 progenitor live in close proximity to the cultivated crop, and many of the cultivars created over the course of cultivation have been preserved). Current work is characterizing genotypic variation in the herbivore- and pathogen-induced defenses of cranberry, exploring the influence of defense induction on fruit chemistry, and characterizing the responses of insect-herbivores and their natural enemies to induced plant volatiles.
