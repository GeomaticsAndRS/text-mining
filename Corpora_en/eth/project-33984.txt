A comprehensive examination of nitrogen cycling and microbial communities within soil microenvironments in integrated organic farming systems in Switzerland We aim to elucidate how conservation tillage and different cover crop types regulate overall N cycling, by altering N losses and availability in organic systems. We will use different approaches to reveal the role of microorganisms in N cycling across different scales.
