Surface enhanced spectroscopy of single molecules We aim to understand the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the enhancement of the Raman signal from molecules placed close to rough metallic surfaces. As a model system we study the controlled interaction of a single molecule with a single metallic nanoparticle.
