From nanoscale simulation to process engineering: Bridging length scales in flows of polymeric fluids Development of (i) prototype network, connected virtually through a primary server/distribution site dedicated to the project (ii) simulation/experimental-based approach to multiscale model building and refining (iii) understanding of the dynamics and structure of entangled polymeric systems Engineering of systems or processes, in which the properties of the final product depend on phenomena that occur at different length and time scales, has emerged as a grand challenge for research aimed at the development of high performance materials. Polymer and polymer matrix composite industries, which account for 15% of the manufacturing segment of the Gross Domestic Product, can greatly benefit from multiscale computational models that integrate information from the molecular, mesoscopic, and continuum length scales. Moreover, the realization of the projected industrial growth potential of up to 35% during the first decade of the 21st century depends critically on the availability of models that are capable of quantitatively predicting the development of microstructure and properties during processing. To date, such models have been based on macroscopic conservation laws which are incapable of accurately predicting the necessary structureproperty-performance relationships. Hence there is a need for development of reliable multiscale process models. The proposed research will initiate and catalyze this much-needed transformation to a computer-based product development through the establishment of a prototype virtual engineering organization for facilitation of collaborations between domestic and international partners. This will lead to rapid new discoveries and the virtually instantaneous dissemination of new developments in this field.
