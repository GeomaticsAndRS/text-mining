Biogenesis of heart muscle cytoarchitecture Cardiomyocytes are characterized by an extremely specialized cytoarchitecture. The assembly and stability of myofibrils will be investigated in healthy and diseased heart muscle. The physiology of sarcomeric proteins will be investigated by generation of genetic alteration of the mouse proteins.
