NCCR IM2: Interactive Multimodal Information Management - Scene Analysis The project develops novel algorithms and technologies for multi-modal interfaces. It for instance brings together speech processing with computer vision. One of the focal points of the project is a smart meeting room, that increases the efficiency of meetings. Retrieval assistance also serves MM. ETH - BIWI contributes to the following research strands: - visual tracking, mainly of people. We are working on a tracker that can distinguish people also in crowds. We also work on the detailed tracking of articulated structures, like hands and bodies - content-based image retrieval: finding objects directly from the content of images, rather than from text annotations, figure captions or names, as in Google
