Multichannel WDM Receiver We realized a pigtailed WDM receiver module, hybrid integrated from a pigtailed InP WDM filter using a curved mirror grating and a pigtailed OEIC 4-channel receiver array based on the monolithic integration of pin photodiodes with JFET transimpedance amplifiers. This hybridization is flexible and allows individual optimization of the devices for wavelength tunability, good sensitivity, high speed, low crosstalk, with no thermal coupling, while minimizing the complexity of the fabrication technology. In a 4-channel WDM transmission experiment at 2.5 Gbit/s we measured a sensitivity of -13 dBm per channel. Although there is still room for improvements, the high functionality module is suitable for WDM system implementations. A part of this work was carried out within the ESPRIT project MOSAIC.
