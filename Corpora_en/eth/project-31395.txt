Monte Carlo simulations of phase transitions and domain structures in multiferroics The goal of the project is to understand the complex structural and ferroelectric phase transitions and domain structures of hexagonal manganites by applying Monte Carlo simulations. Multiferroics show complex phase diagrams including several phase transitions and coexisting ferroic phases. We apply statistical models and Monte Carlo simulations to investigate those phase transitions and the resulting domain structures. One example are multiferroic hexagonal manganites. At low temperatures they are simultaneously antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric. The ferroelectricity originates in an unusual structural phase transition and can be described by the so-called clock model. By performing Monte Carlo simulations based on the clock model, we can visualize the uncommon ferroelectric domain structure of the manganites in two and three dimensions. Furthermore we can simulate the structural phase transition and study the behaviour of the structural and ferroelectric order parameters.
