Optimized ensembles for Monte Carlo simulations Broad-histogram Monte Carlo simulations directly calculate the density of states of a (quantum) system by sampling broad energy ranges and thereby give access to thermodynamic properties, especially the free energy and entropy. While mulitcanonical sampling techniques have recently become very popular, we demonstrated that these flat-histogram methods suffer from a critical slowing down ­ similar to the critical slowing down of canonical simulations near a second order phase transition. In the course of this project we have shown that the simulation of an optimized ensemble overcomes the slowdown and substantially speeds up equilibration in systems which have long relaxation times in conventional simulations such as low-energy configurations of frustrated systems, domain walls in ordered phases or dense Lennard-Jones liquids. The key idea is to improve equilibration by systematically maximizing the tunneling rates between low and high entropy states based on measurements of the local diffusivity. In ongoing research we have extended this new Monte Carlo method to fields such as optimized parallel tempering simulations of the 3D Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass, the simulation of complex fluids and the folding of small proteins. Work is in progress on applying it to quantum systems.
