Values and rationality in science This projects investigates the understanding and role of epistemic and non-epistemic values in theory appraisal in basic and applied or problem-oriented research. It also focuses on the role of epistemic and non-epistemic values in the appraisal of scientific findings as evidence for policy. This project analyses the philosophical debate on values in science and argues for a pluralistic pragmatist perspective on the understanding and justification of epistemic standards in theory appraisal. More specifically, arguments to support the following theses are elaborated: (1) epistemic standards characterize an ideal of scientific understanding in accordance with the purpose of a theory. (2) They have the direct function of assessing evidence as well as the relevance of theoretical claims regarding the problem at hand. (3) Moral and prudential values, meanwhile, are part of the considerations pertaining to the indirect function, which concerns how to specify and weigh epistemic standards. With regards to the justification of epistemic standards, the project will elaborate on a coherentist framework that suits both basic research and research intended to solve real-world problems, where different epistemic standards and non-epistemic considerations may be appropriate in each case. This understanding of epistemic and non-epistemic values in science will be used to clarify some of the aspects in the debate on uncertainty assessment of climate change research and implications for use of scientific results in the policy-process. A goal is to show the importance of assessing both, relevance and evidence of scientific results for policy.
