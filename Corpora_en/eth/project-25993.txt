Enhancement of visible-light solar water disinfection with riboflavin and its derivatives Riboflavin (Vitamin B2) and its derivatives are sensitizers that can enhance pathogen photoinactivation. This project aims to understand the mechanisms governing inactivation during solar disinfection and to develop a low-cost immobilized sensitizer that can be applied to disinfect drinking water.
