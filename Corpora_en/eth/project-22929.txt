Design Tools For Funicular Shells This research is implementing Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) in a powerful interactive design tool for exploring and designing funicular structures. Based on reciprocal diagrams and linear optimization, it provides an intuitive, fast method, adopting the same advantages of techniques such as Graphic Statics, but offering a viable extension to fully three-dimensional problems. The designer can control the many degrees of freedom of highly indeterminate three-dimensional equilibrium systems to explore structural form. The project demonstrates the power of TNA for structurally informed, but surprising design explorations.
