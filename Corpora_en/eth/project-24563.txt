3D Scene Flow Estimation The goal of this project is to develop an algorithm to estimate both the 3D geometry and the 3D motion of a scene, from camera images. Given images of a dynamic scene, simultaneously recorded by two or more synchronized cameras at different (two or more) time steps, the goal of 3D scene flow estimation is to determine both, the 3d geometry and the 3D motion of the scene densely at every pixel. Therefore a method dealing with 3D scene flow estimation has to jointly solve two popular vision problems. The two-view or multi-view stereo problem at at least two time steps and the optical flow problem for each camera. From both stereo and optical flow, scene flow estimation inherits the need for regularization: it is ill-posed because of depth ambiguity and the aperture problem, and thus requires prior knowledge. The most commonly used prior in the literature favors smooth surfaces and motion fields. The current method developed, to estimate the scene flow, uses a minimal parameterization of the scene by 3D entities instead of 2d entities like optical flow and disparity. To find these parameters and therefore gain a description of the scene flow, an energy function is formulated which is minimized in a variational framework.
