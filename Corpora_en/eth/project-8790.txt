Unconventional superconductivity in ruthenates Sr2RuO4 is an exemplary realization of a spin-triplet superconductor with close similarities to He-3. In this project the properties of this material are studied in close contact with ongoing experimental efforts. Shortly after the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 in 1994 it became clear that this system is a spin triplet superconductor. Faster than in any previous case the basic Cooper pairing symmetry was identified [19]. The superconducting state corresponds to a so-called chiral p-wave, a time reversal symmetry breaking phase, resembling the A-phase of superfluid He-3. In addition this system is a well-characterized quasi-two-dimensional Fermi liquid with strong correlation effects. Despite this successful description of several aspects of this textbook-type material a large variety of open questions remain. This includes details of the pairing mechanism [2,17], the gap anisotropy , effects of spin-orbit coupling [7,8], tunneling and and Josephson effect[18]. Over the years our project has been concerned mainly with the following problems: 1) The role of the three relevant electronic orbitals (4d-t2g). On one hand this influences the thermodynamics of the superconducting phase [3,15]. On the other hand, it determines through spin-orbit coupling the stable Cooper pair structure [8,12]. 2) The effects of chirality: This involves the presence of gaples chiral quasiparticle states and their influence on electromagnetic response [1,16], various types of feedback effects which may play a role in stabilizing the chiral p-wave phase [4,5,6]. 3) The 3-Kelvin-phase , an inhomogeneous superconducting phase occuring above the bulk Tc on the interface between Sr2RuO4 and metallic Ru-inclusions. This phase represents an intrinsic realization of mesoscopic unconventional superconductivity [9,13]. 4) The effects of a magnetic field: This includes problems of the anomalous temperature dependence of the anisotropy of Hc2 which may be a special effect of spin-orbit coupling [11], the nucleation of the 3-Kelvin phase in a magnetic field [9] as well as the quasiparticle spectrum of vortices in the chiral p-wave phase c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
