Combination of feature-based and geometric positioning The location of mobile objects is typically determined by measuring distances or angles and exploiting geometric relations. Location can also be derived by comparing measurements of spatially varying phenomena to a corresponding model. Fusion of both approaches yields high accuracy and availability. The location of mobile objects is usually based on angles, distances or distance differences, and on analytical geometry. It typically requires unobstructed line-of-sight between the mobile object ´ and known reference points for Sabsolute locationS or integrating incremental measurements for ´ Srelative positioningS. The main drawback of the relative methods is the rapid decrease of spatial accuracy over time and distance. The main drawback of the absolute methods is that a direct lineof-sight can often be established only with considerable effort or not at all e.g., in densely built-up areas or with distinctive topography. We investigate how established geometric methods can be augmented by feature-based positioning which is based on the comparison of observed feature vectors with given reference features ´ ´ (Sworld modelS). Feature-based positioning does not require any line-of-sight, yields SabsoluteS position with an accuracy independent of time and distance travelled, and allows using the inherent location information of a variety of observable features. It is particularly useful for indoor positioning and positioning in urban environment where GPS/GNSS is not available or not accurate enough. Our approach is based on Bayesian estimation which allows to integrate prior knowledge and heterogeneous measurements seamlessly. Particular emphasis is paid to limitations and quality assessment. Real data used for demonstration have been obtained at an airport where a combination of WLAN signal strength measurements and GPS-observations is used to locate vehicles for realtime display in an airport management system.
