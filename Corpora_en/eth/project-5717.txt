The role of alpine pasture property rights and farm characteristics on sustainable mountaingrazing: a theoretical and empirical analysis and policy recommendations for the Swiss mountain area Mountain farming is historically characterised by scarcity in land and labour on the village-level farm. Mountain grazing therefore provides an additional feeding basis and releases home farm labour for the winter fodder preparation. The cultivation of mountainous areas by agriculture is subject to substantial changes. A reduction in mountain grazing with negative ecological effects can be observed as a result of, e.g., structural change in agriculture. Such developments may conflict with growing preferences for complements of mountain grazing in terms of public goods. An insufficient provision of these complements justifies agricultural policy measures. No scientifically-founded concept for such measures exists in Switzerland. In this project the following aspects are therefore investigated for different mountain grazing property right regimes: (a) The organisational and economic interrelations between the village-level farm and its mountain grazing area are characterised theoretically and empirically; (b) The effects of structural change in agriculture on mountain grazing with various types of ruminants are investigated with the help of a simulation model; (c) Based on a transaction cost approach, organisational and structural reforms of mountain grazing systems are developed; (d) External effects and public goods of different mountain grazing systems are compared and necessary policy measures for sustainable mountain grazing are developed. This project is accomplished within the scope of the Swiss contribution to the EC shared-cost RTD action Landscape Development, Biodiversity and Co-operative Livestock Systems in Europe (LACOPE), EESD-ESD-3 of the Biosphere Reserve Entlebuch.
