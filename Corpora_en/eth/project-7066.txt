Communal and European Social Reporting Social reporting designates the monitoring of social change and welfare development. Research activities in this field refer to the community level (City of Zurich) on the one hand and to the European level on the other. Research on the community level takes place within the framework of the project Societal Monitoring on the Basis of Administrative Data run by the City of Zurich and based on a set of already existing administrative data produced by daily routine. The systematic production of this data has recently been established in the Department of Social Affairs of the City of Zurich (Sozialdepartment der Stadt Zürich). The data set contains information on population, income and on recipients of different kinds of welfare aid and unemployment insurance. The data are available on different intra-urban spatial levels. The communal social reporting focusses on social problems such as poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. On the European level research activities take place within the research network EUREPORTING composed of 20 research teams from 15 countries. The objective of these reseach activities is to create a science-based European system of social reporting and welfare measurement. This objective should be achieved by utilizing existing data bases and by establishing a modul for a European Welfare Survey.
