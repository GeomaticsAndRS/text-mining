Search for Time Reversal Violation in Weak Interactions Precision experiments focusing on well defined aspects of fundamental symmetries at low energies provide complementary information to searches for new phenomena with the most powerful high energy accelerators. Present theoretical ideas suggest that time reversal violation (TRV) could be a signature of physics that is not contained in the Standard Model of elementary particles. The standard vector-axial vector theory of weak interactions does not predict sizable TRV effects in systems that are built of the light u and d quarks. In particular, the transverse spin polarization of leptons in a plane perpendicular to the spin direction of the weakly decaying particle or nucleus should vanish. Our experiments search for such a polarization component. In an experiment with $^{8}nuclei we determine the magnitude R of the TRV triple correlation between the nuclear polarization, the momentum and the transverse polarization of the electrons emitted in the decay process. The polarization of the electrons is analyzed by Mott scattering in a polarimeter of novel design. Our present result, R=0.0009+-0.0022, is consistent with time reversal invariance and represents the most precise measurement in this class of experiments.
