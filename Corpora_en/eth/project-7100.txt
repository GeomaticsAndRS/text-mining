Fiume Tagliamento: Ecology of an Alpine river corridor This project unites ecological research on floodplain river environments by crossing disciplinary boundaries of plant ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental chemistry. An interdisciplinary approach helps to disentangle the complex interactions between habitat dynamics, ecological succession and maintenance of biodiversity. The goal of the Tagliamento project is to integrate knowledge and understanding of floodplain processes at a multi-disciplinary level to further our ability to manage, revitalize, and restore rivers. Within this project research is strongly linked at the landscape level. Floodplain function and biodiversity is likely to be influenced by vegetated islands. Therefore these islands represent a common theme in sub-projects.
