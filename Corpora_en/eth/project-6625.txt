Computational Biochemistry Our group is interested in developing algorithms for the derivation of useful biological information from genetic sequence information. We have been working in the area of sequence alignment both at the DNA and protein level, measuring distance (and hence time since divergence under certain circumstances) between sequences, reconstructing phylogenetic trees, aligning DNA sequences against protein sequences for various purposes, including the ability to determining correct intron placement, and various methods of fingerprinting proteins through mass spectrometry techniques. Most of our work has been done in close cooperation with organic chemistry (Prof. S Benner and associates). Our algorithms and their implementations are distributed freely and available through two remote automatic servers.
