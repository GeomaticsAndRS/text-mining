Genetic Enhancement Bioavaialbility-Finger Millet The project aims to enhance yield potential and bioavailability of essential nutrients in finger millet by genomics means. The goal of the project is to enhance yield potential and bioavailability of essential nutrients in finger millet. A large genomic resource through whole genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis will be generated. The draft sequence information will be utilised to discover a large repository of molecular markers like SSR and SNPs. These resources would be used for the development of linkage maps and subsequently to discover QTL for complex traits associated with stress tolerance and yield potential. A combined approach of LD mapping and linkage mapping will be adopted for this purpose. The trait donor genotypes along with the QTL markers would form an excellent source for crop improvement through the initiation of focused molecular breeding programs by shell partners. The other major goal is to identify genotypes with reduced anti-nutritional factors to enhance the bioavailability of essential nutrients like iron and zinc. A stable isotopes based approach will be adopted to assess the enhanced bioavailability of these nutrients. The improvement in health and nutrient security and the resultant improvement in the socio-economic status of the end-users will be assessed and attempts to popularise the technology would be undertaken. The project aims at improving the yield potential of finger millet, develop value-added products and improve the bioavailability of nutrients to the consumers. These developments are expected to improve significantly the socio-economic status of resource poor farmers who cultivate the crop and strengthen the nutritional security of those who consume the crop products.
