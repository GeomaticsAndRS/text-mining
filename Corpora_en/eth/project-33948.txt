MobileCoach - The Open Source Behavioral Intervention Platform The MobileCoach serves as an open source platform for fully-automated behavioral interventions. The vision of the MobileCoach team is to provide an open source behavioral intervention platform for fully-automated digital interventions. Due to a modular and extendable architecture, the MobileCoach lays a fruitful ground for digital interventions in several application domains of behavior change. For example, the MobileCoach can be used to design and evaluate digital health interventions in the context of smoking cessation, nutrition or physical activity. Based on personal characteristics and prior behavior assessed when participating in a digital intervention, the MobileCoach uses communication services (e.g. SMS) or sensor services (e.g. physical activity tracker) to monitor central indicators of the particular behavior on a regular basis. Building on individual data, MobileCoach users profit from individualized messages and valuable insights motivating for long-term behavior change. In the pilot phase, the MobileCoach will support two concrete health behaviors. Due to its opensource character, however, future research teams around the globe may contribute by adding features to the software and broadening the number of supported behaviors. The first release of the MobileCoach will be made available by the end of 2014. Further details can be obtained here: http://www.mobilecoach.ch
