Image analysis based on physical models and optimal observers We are developing image analysis algorithms for many different biological applications. Image processing is based on the optimal reconstruction of the system states using methods of Sequential Monte Carlo, Kalman Filtering, or Particle Filtering. Many biological experiments are based on light microscopy to observe dynamic processes in living cells. Manual analysis and intuitive interpretation of image data are hereby more and more replaced by automated analysis. The use of large data sets and high degrees of automation results in improved significance and results that are less biased by prior expectations, i.e. that have better reproducibility. We are developing image analysis algorithms for many different biological applications. A large class of these algorithms shares the property that a physical model of the object of interest is used to process the image data. The algorithms for image enhancement, filtering, model implementation, and estimation hereby remain unchanged. We focus at implementing new algorithms in a standardized framework that will enable fast software development and reduce the amount of redundant code. In a first step, we will apply this framework to the problem of object detection. The dynamics of the observed objects and the transfer function of the imaging equipment are given by statespace system models. Image processing is based on the optimal reconstruction of the system states using methods of Sequential Monte Carlo, Kalman Filtering, or Particle Filtering. A method for the segmentation of images under conditions of structured backgrounds and temporary occlusion will be implemented. The method is flexible enough to accommodate arbitrary dynamical systems, including the possibility of switching behavior be-tween different state space models.
