Applied Vision Research - Visual Screening Service The main aim of ergonomics is to adapt workplace conditions to the needs and capacities of the worker. The optimisation of visual functions of the worker also supports that aim. For this purpose our Institute offers a visual screening service. Usually companies, at which good vision is imperative for work, request our visual screening service. A short individual consultation is also included in this service. In parallel the visual screening service conducts investigations aiming to improve visual screening especially in occupational health. This task includes development and validation of new visual screening methods such as PC assisted vision testing.
