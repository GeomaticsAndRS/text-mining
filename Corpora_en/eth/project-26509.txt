Off4Firms The project aims to analyze voluntary incentives by firms to their employees to improve householdsS CO2-balances. We identify adequate corporate measures reducing private energy consumption and CO2-emissions and investigate the impact of firms on behavioural changes of their employees. In the recent past, national and international firms started voluntarily offering incentives to their employees to improve householdsS CO2-balances. Given the emergence of such initiatives on the corporate level, the question arises whether a government support for such initiatives would be an appropriate extension of current energy and climate policy instruments in Switzerland. It is the proclaimed objective of the proposed project to analyse whether it makes sense to look at firms as intermediates to actuate energy efficiency and low-carbon investments of their employees and thus the respective households. Furthermore, we investigate into the question how firms could be incentivised to take over such a role on a broader scale. The key questions to be addressed in this project are: T ¸ Q1: How strong is the impact of firms on behavioural changes of their employees in their private energy consumption and investment decisions? T ¸ Q2: What types of adequate corporate measures reducing private energy consumption and CO2emissions can be identified? T ¸ Q3: How could a policy scheme be designed to foster the role of firms as intermediates for CO2reduction measures? T ¸ Q4: Which accompanying arrangements would be necessary to ensure the aggregate effectiveness of such an incentive scheme?
