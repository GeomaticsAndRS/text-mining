D-Mag-Bio (Development of Magnesium-Selective Electrodes forMeasurements in Biological Fluids) Tripodale malonic acid diamide derivatives have experimentally shown to be effective synthetic host compounds for complexation of Mg$^{2+}$in solvent polymeric membranes. PVC-membranes containing such ionophores are used as selective sensing layers to prepare magnesium-selective electrodes. The selectivity pattern of those electrodes is considered in view of a biological application such as the determination of the active concentration of free Mg$^{2+}$ in the intra- and extracellular space. The structure of the ionophores was varied to enhance the discrimination of Ca$^{2+}$and Na$^{+}$, primarily. However, the selectivity pattern is extremely sensitive to changes in the membrane composition (lipophilicity, ratio of anionic sites relative to the ionophore's molality, ligand concentration, etc). The project is aimed at further developments of the ionophores and membranes, at the application of those membranes to total magnesium determinations in human plasma in clinical automates, at the development of the technique for direct measurements in whole blood and at getting rid of the interferences by silicone-containing tubes. In an advanced state of the project, studies on intracellular monitoring will be resumed.
