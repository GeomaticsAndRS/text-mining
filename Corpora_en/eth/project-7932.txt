Low-Temperature Transport in Icosahedral Quasicrystals In the Al-Mn-Pd system we are investigating the electrical and thermal transport of quasicrystals with low Mn content. We have synthesized a series of samples within the quasicrystalline area of the equilibrium phase diagram. Measurements of the ac-susceptibility suggest that Mn in quasicrystals with a composition close to the boundary of the quasicrystalline area of the equilibrium phase diagram is non-magnetic. We have observed a systematic correlation between the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and the Mn content in Al-Mn-Pd quasicrystals. By substitution of Mn by Re, quasicrystals in the Al-Re-Pd system with comparable structural quality to those in the Al-Mn-Pd system have been obtained. These AlRePd quasicrystals are characterized by very low electrical conductivities at all temperatures, decreasing with decreasing temperature. Of interest is the behaviour at very low temperatures, corresponding experiments, also probing magnetoconductivity, are in progress. Transport properties of the lattice are studied via the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity.
