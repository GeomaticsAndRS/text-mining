Is a good Deacon catalyst a good oxychlorination catalyst? The performance of the new generation of HCl oxidation catalysts for ethylene oxychlorination is evaluated in this project. It will allow to gather a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences in the chemistry between these two processes. Its aim is enabling a rational design of the The oxychlorination of ethylene to ethylene dichloride (EDC), a key intermediate in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), is one of the most important processes in todaySs polymer industry. Supported CuCl2 catalysts, originally used in HCl oxidation (Deacon reaction), have been, for more than 50 years, exclusively employed in this reaction. The only catalyst design strategy valid to prevent the catalyst deactivation, caused by its volatilization, and particle agglomeration, was promotion of the existing CuCl2 materials. However, it could not overcome the inherent instability of the copper-based active phase. The recent breakthrough in the design of stable HCl oxidation catalysts (e.g. RuO2 and CeO2), together with the anticipated chemical similarities between the two reactions, such as the ability to activate chlorine under corrosive reactions conditions, provides a pool of new materials that could be applied in the ethylene oxychlorination. However, the presence of ethylene in oxychlorination introduces significant differences, especially in terms of side reactions (e.g. ethylene combustion) being absent in HCl oxidation. Herein, we investigate the oxychlorination performance of Deacon catalysts in order to attain a comprehensive understanding of the surface chemistry governing the catalyst activity in these two reactions.
