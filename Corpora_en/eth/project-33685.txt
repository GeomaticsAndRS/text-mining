COST FP1206: European Mixed Forests. Integrating Scientific Knowledge in Sustainable Forest Management (EuMIXFOR) In this project, we will extend our knowledge about possible benefits of mixed-species forest over monocultures by analysing selected ecosystem goods and services in different regions of Switzerland. European forestry is currently in a transition, with an increasing number of single-species coniferous forest being converted into mixed-species forests. Proposed benefits include an increase in productivity, increased resilience to disturbances, higher resistance to climate change, as well as the provisioning of a wider range of ecosystem goods and services (EGS). Although mixedspecies forestry appears to be a promising approach for creating productive and resistant forests for the future, the influence of species composition, mixture level or age classes remains unclear. The project will use a modelling approach to help clarify the benefits of mixed-species forests over monocultures. Due to the flexibility of simulation modelling, it is possible to examine multiple species combinations and age structures (single vs. mixed-species, even-aged vs. uneven-aged) to quantify those forest characteristics that are important for providing various EGS. The selected EGS are: tree biomass production, protection against gravitational natural hazards and habitat quality for birds. The results of this project will increase our knowledge about the potential benefits of mixed-species forests, and reduce the risk of climate change for future forestry by identifying strategies for alternative management practices.
