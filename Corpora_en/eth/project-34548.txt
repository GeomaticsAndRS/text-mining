Competition, dispersal, and species abilities to track climate change Our ability to track the diversity of future ecosystems depends on our understanding of how communities are structured by interactions between species. In many plant communities, competition for limited resources is an important force determining which species persist. Competitive interactions are changing as climate changes, both as a result of physiological responses to warmer conditions, and from new interactions with fast-dispersing species that quickly invade new communities. In this project, we use diverse alpine wildflower communities to experimentally investigate changes in competition with changing climate conditions. We combine empirical results with ecological theory to predict shifts in diversity over the next century of climate change.
