Geology Tracking glacial erosion and glacier occupation in the Alps with theunique combination of measurement and modeling of 10Be, 14C, and 36Cl in bedrock Production of radionuclides by cosmic radiation is used to derive age information of geological systems. Within this Project in particular galcial erosion and glacier occupation is primarily targeted.
