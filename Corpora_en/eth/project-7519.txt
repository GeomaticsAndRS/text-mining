Hydrothermal alteration of zirconolite Zirconolite is a titanate that forms part of Synroc a ceramic designed for immobilizing high-level radioactive waste. Geological environments proposed for the burial of high level radioactive waste may become exposed to natural fluids and temperatures up to 300 C. Consequently studies on corrosion and leaching behaviour of Synroc are of utmost importance. Leaching experiments involving synthetic zirconolite are conducted in our hydrothermal high-pressure laboratory to obtain information about leaching behaviour of zirconolite.
