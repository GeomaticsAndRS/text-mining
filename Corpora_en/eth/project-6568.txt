Perspectives and conditions of a community management of the forest areas:a rural community of the Koutiala (Mali) district. In Mali, the system of global production is developing fast due to overexploitation of the natural resources. This evolution goes hand in hand with the present transformations on a socio-cultural, political and legal level. Serious conflicts of utilisation of the natural resources emerge. The aims of the project are: a) studying the opportunities, the ways and means of developing community forestry aiming at preserving and developing the local resources of the forest and the tree in a rural environment b) analysing the level of adaptation of the main conditions of the new legislation (decentralisation, ground, rural and forest legislations as well as the common law with regard to the establishment of community forestry c) suggesting regulations for forestry resources management with regard to research.
