Novel nanocomposite filter media for adsorption based water NANOSORP treatment U We develop innovative composite filter materials and membranes for water treatment. These filters can potentially be used for a wide range of applications including pre- treatment, post-treatment of water and wastewater, as well as gravity-driven direct surface water filtration.
