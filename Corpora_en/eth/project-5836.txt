Interfacial Mass Transfer and Stability of Emulsions Processes which contain the mixing of disperse liquid phases into a molten fat suspension are studied as well as the behaviour of the disperse liquid droplets upon solidification of the external fat phase. A first field of research involves the dispersing process and the surface interactions of an additional solid ingredient in emulsions. The analytical methods applied are interfacial tension measurements, rheometry and particle sizing by laser diffraction. The solidification and storage of the dispersions is investigated in the second research step. The influence of the liquid disperse phase on the crystallization of the continuous fat matrix is another question to be studied. Furthermore, such liquid phases are known to be mobile to some extent. Diffusion effects in the liquid and/or solid fat matrix are studied to find methods to prevent such effects.
