Chemical and physical factor that influence the stability of metal-organic frameworks By the use of combined TGA/IR, Powder X-Ray, TGA/MS, and X-ray adsorption techniques, we want to understand what are the parameters that affect the stability of MOFs and what are the products formed after decomposition to help the design and the synthesis of more chemically and physically ...
