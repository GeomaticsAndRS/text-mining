Poverty and Social Policy The first research activity within this field is based on a panel study on 323 single mothers in Zurich (first wave 1992, second wave 1993, third wave 1996). The basic questions concern the dynamics of living conditions and poverty of Swiss single mothers living in an urban context and the possible effects of living conditions and social networks on health. This study is based on earlier research about health effects of social support and social stress using a representative population sample which shows indirect positive health effects of social networks. The Swiss sample of single mothers will be compared with a U.S. sample of urban single mothers from the National Survey of Families and Households (N=790) in order to examine whether or not single mothers suffer from substantially more disadvantages in the United States than in Switzerland. A second research activity within this field focus on the investigation of the dynamics of urban poverty and welfare aid using annual data on welfare recipients of the City of Zurich since 1993.
