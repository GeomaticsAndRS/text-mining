Tracing Ocean Water Masses with Radiogenic Isotopes Continental rocks are eroded through chemical and physical weathering processes which provide trace metals to the ocean. The radiogenic isotope composition of some of these trace metals (Nd, Hf) is characteristic of the rocks eroded. Depending on the respective residence times in the ocean's water column these specific isotope signatures are distributed within the global thermohaline circulation system and lead to significant differences in the radiogenic isotope composition of particular water masses which can be traced over long distances. These signatures provide information about sources and mixing proportions of water masses. They contribute valuable information complementary to classic oceanographic tools such as salinity and temperature. Currently the focus of research is the Arctic Ocean, where so far no radiogenic isotope studies have been performed. New information on sources and pathways of water masses of the Arctic ocean is expected. Samples were collected in the Canadian Basin during a cruise with the US Coastguard icebreaker Polar star in August 2000. A second expedition with the Swedish ice breaker Oden taking place in July/August 2001 will complete the sampling of all 5 major deep basins in the Arctic ocean. Particular emphasis is dedicated to the attempt to measure the isotopic composition of Hf in sea water for the first time. This has been prevented previously by the extremely low Hf concentrations in seawater (ca. 0.2 - 1 pmol/kg water) and analytical problems to measure the isotopic composition of Hf precisely. With the new technique of MC-ICPMS the measurements are expected to be possible and will provide valuable information on the behaviour of this trace element and its sources in the world ocean.
