Smart Antenna Algorithms for HIPERLAN2 Type Systems To judge the capabilities of smart antennas (SA) concepts for HIPERLAN2 type systems, a reference system with a conventional demodulation scheme has been specified. The specification deals with all topics related to standard air interfaces like e.g. data rates, granularity, modulation formats, multiple access, duplexing of upstream/downstream etc. The considered carrier frequencies are not limited to the ones specified for HIPERLAN2. A major effort is required for the definition of the most promising SA concepts for the above specifications. Apart from the application of accurate channel models, an important issue is the modeling of hardware effects corrupting the received signal in order to devise realistic SA approaches. We consider a fully symmetric system set-up w.r.t. the baseband signal processing and the application of antenna arrays in access points as well as in mobile terminals. Since interference from other users and intersymbol interference as well as inter-channel interference in HIPERLAN2 system are not critical problems we focus on channel fading mitigation by using an antenna array in order to improve the transmission quality and reliability. Receive diversity obtained by diversity combing techniques, transmit diversity with space-time coding and combinations thereof are considered. In each case the channel estimation plays an essential role. The grid structure of the training sequence distributed in the time-frequency plane together with the use of an antenna array suggest a three-dimensional interpolation of the time, frequency and space correlation characteristics determined by the propagation environment.
