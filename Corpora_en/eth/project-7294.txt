Monolithic Components for Adaptive Antenna Combining in HIPERLAN 1 Receivers The HIPERLAN 1 (High Performance Radio Local Area Network) standard in the frequency range between 5.15 and 5.3 GHz plays a growing role among the emerging wireless LAN systems. The use of adaptive antenna combining is investigated in this project to counteract the time dispersive nature of the indoor radio channel. Monolithic integrated circuits such as low noise amplifiers, attenuators and phase shifters are being developed and fabricated in a commercial GaAs MESFET foundry process. Low power consumption is essential for the whole adaptive antenna systems to become a viable alternative to conventional receiver architectures. To limit the influence of manufacturing process tolerances on the system, a calibration method is developed, that allows high precision operation with standard low cost components.
