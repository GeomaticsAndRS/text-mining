Structural Components Made of High Performance Aluminium Alloys The project concerns the net shape fabrication of complex shaped components made of new high perfor-mance, damage tolerant aluminium alloys by means of extrusion and hydroforming . Such alloys have already been developed at the Institute of Metallurgy of the ETHZ. Selected alloy variations which are optimized with respect to chemical composition and heat treatment, are extruded to profiles and hydroformed to components, such as complex T-fittings. The task is of great industrial relevance for at least three reasons: First, hydroformed components are of high forging quality and will replace aluminium castings. Second, within frame-constructions for transport applications weldings in most critical areas of stress concentration can be avoided and be displaced to less critical areas. Third, for such appli-cations a new light weight construction concept will result and be able to compete with conventional steel construction. In order to obtaiin high quality as well as a high economy of fabrication systematic metallur-gical and fracture mechanical investigations before and after the shaping process are performed. In order to guarantee full safety and reliability, selected components are tested under simulated service conditions. Besides the high performance alloys recently developed at ETH also conventional aluminium alloys are considered.
