Targeting of the Cdc48/p97 ATPase to the plasma membrane The ubiquitin-dependent chaperone p97 is best characterized for its involvement in cell cycle regulation and protein quality control. We have identified a potential adapter that is targeted to subdomains at the plasma membrane. Our aim is to clarify a potential function in p97-mediated signaling.
