Experimental investigations on the rheology and structure of surfactant assemblies at the planar and curved liquid-liquid interface Interfacial rheometry is combined with Brewster Angle Microscopy (BAM) in order to observe the formation and deformation behaviour of interfaciial structures / assemblies of macromo- lecules and surfactants. Steady state and transient (kinetics) behaviour of such interfacial structures is quantifie
