Development of BioConductor libraries to analyze high content microarray data The goal is to develop new algorithms to analyze Afymetrix microarray data and annotations. These methods will be encapsulated as freely available open source packages in the BioConductor repository. The goal is to develop new algorithms to analyze Afymetrix microarray data and annotations.These methods will be encapsulated as freely available open source packages in the BioConductor repository. Work will be focused on extending the features of exonmap/X:MAP system for exon arrays (Okoniewski et al, Gen Biol, 2007; Yates et al, NAR, 2007),but may be also applied to other types of oligo microarrays.
