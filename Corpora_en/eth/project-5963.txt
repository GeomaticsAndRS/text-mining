New Analytical Approaches to Hypericum perforatum Preparations of Hypericum perforatum have become important in phytotherapy of minor depressions during the last few years. The activity of this plant has been established in several extensive clinical studies. Although there has been much research on H. perforatum and its preparations, there are still several unsolved analytical and chemical problems. To solve the analytical difficulties sensitive and sophisticated analytical methods are evaluated and compared. Among others: HPLC in connection with selective detection modes i.e. photodiode array and fluorescence; quantitative thin layer chromatography with scanner detection and evaluation either direct or after derivatization. Further there exists no extensive study comparing different clinically tested preparations. To make such a comparision a fingerprint analytical method has to be optimized. This includes shortened chromatographic run time and improved separation. With this method hypericin and pseudohypericin as well as the flavonoids can be determined and quantified. Another set back in the development of an analytical method for H. perforatum is the limited availability of hypericin and pseudohypericin as reference standards. It is our goal to improve their availabilty by developing an efficient method of isolation. As there are still questions regarding the active principle of H. perforatum, we are using a receptor binding test to guide our fractionation and isolation of the active metabolites.
