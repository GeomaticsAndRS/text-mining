High-Speed Travelling Wave InP/InGaAsP Optical Space Switches Optical space switches are key components for broadband optical communication systems. Besides low insertion losses, high on-off ratios and polarization-insensitive operation, high switching speeds are very important. Based on our previous work on polarization-insensitive InP/InGaAsP Mach-Zehnder interferometer space switches we have optimized design and processing for high speed operation. In our approach switching is based on field-effects, which are intrinsically fast. Hence, speed is only limited by the parasitics of the electrical line. To obtain low switching voltages a travelling wave design was used. The phase shifting waveguides together with the gold electrodes form a microstrip line, whose capacitance is dominated by the depletion capacitance of the pin-junction. A line impedance of 25 Ohm has been chosen to obtain velocity matching of optical and electrical signals. To reduce DC resistances, signal and ground electrodes are electroplated. To lower contact resistances, a highly p-doped InGaAs contact layer and a quaternary grading layer between p$^{+}$-InGaAs and p$^{+}$-InP have been used. Switching voltages of 5 V for TE- and TM-polarization have been achieved for 8 mm long phase shifting waveguides composed of two 4 mm sections. Insertion losses are below 10 dB. The electrical bandwidth of a single line section, as derived from on-wafer S-parameter measurements, is 9 GHz.
