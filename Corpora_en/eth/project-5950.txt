Self-Organization of the Cerebral Cortex Sensory information is processed in the brain in clearly demarcated areas of the cerebral cortex. In brain development, it is unknown whether the demarcations of sensory areas are determined by factors intrinsic to the cortex or whether the neurons which innervate the cortex act as extrinsic signals for the specialization of the cortex. GABA$_{A}$-receptors have been found to be the earliest markers available for area demarcation in the visual cortex. By preventing thalamic neurons in newborn rats from innervating the visual cortex and by interfering pharmacologically with synaptic transmission in the cortex, it will be determined whether GABA$_{A}$-receptor expression is amenable to regulation by factors intrinsic to the cortex or extrinsic from ingrowing neurons. The study is expected to advance our understanding of the rules for self-organization of the brain.
