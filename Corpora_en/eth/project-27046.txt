The Politics of Climate Change: Options for Action in a Changing International Environment The research project seeks to find out what dynamic patterns and configurations contribute (and in what way) to the progress of establishing effective climate protection measures at the national and international political level by a systematic longitudinal analysis of relevant policy processes. We address some of the most critical political questions related to climate change policymaking in an innovative and systematic manner: How have the politics of climate change evolved at the international political level and in selected key countries (such as the European Union and its member states, the United States of America, China) since 2001? ° particular also from so-called smaller and geopolitiWhat options do national governmentsUin ° cally less powerful nations such as SwitzerlandUhave to support and successfully adopt effective climate change protection measures? To find answers to these overall research questions, the research project combines innovative data gathering and analysis techniques (textual analysis, event data analysis, social network analysis) together with expert interviews and document analysis to study political processes over time in a systematic way. Theoretically, the research project is located at the intersection of domestic politics and international relations. On the one hand, it looks for domestic political determinants in selected key countries that help to understand the international climate change policy process. On the other hand, it analyzes to what degree political dynamics at the international level open or restrict opportunities for acting on climate change policy issues at the national level.
