Design for Multi-Material Additive Manufacturing Material-process-structure interactions are investigated for additive manufacturing with the aim to provide quantitative models for different printing techniques. The design space is extended to multi-materials and its potential for (bio-inspired) lightweight and time-dependent structures explored.
