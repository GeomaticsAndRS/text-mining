Crossing-Free Configurations in the Plane - Counting, Enumeration, and Sampling The goal of this project is the understanding of crossing-free geometric graphs-these are graphs with an embedding on a given planar point set where the edges are drawn as straight line segments without crossings. The goal of this project is the understanding of crossing-free geometric graphs-these are graphs with an embedding on a given planar point set where the edges are drawn as straight line segments without crossings. Often we are restricted to certain types of graphs, most prominently triangulations, but also spanning cycles, spanning trees or (perfect) matchings (and crossing-free partitions), among others. A primary goal is to enumerate, count, or sample graphs of a certain type for a given point set-so these are algorithmic questions-, or to give estimates for the maximum and minimum number of such graphs on any set of n points-these are problems in extremal combinatorial geometry.
