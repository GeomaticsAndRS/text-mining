Ultra-high field MRI technology This project aims to enable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in extended objects at very high magnetic field. It is conducted with a 7 Tesla magnet at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering. The project's long-term goal is enabling superior-quality in-vivo human MRI for research and clinical use.
