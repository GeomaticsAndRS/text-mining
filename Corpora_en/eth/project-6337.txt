Systems Ergonomics - The Process of Participatory Work Analysis The success of changes in socio-technical systems, especially the ergonomic design of work systems is obviously determined by the way of collaboration with the users of the concerned system. Methods of participation are more and more popular in co-operative system design activities. But obviously in complex work systems most solutions still mismatch the user's need. This leads to the point of view, that not co-operative problem solving but the mutual understanding of problems must be the most important key factor of success in system design. The importance of this process of problem understanding is often neglected and it is often a relative fast and expert driven phase in the beginning of a project. Therefore the intention to use a better concept of project management leads to the investigation of the expert-users interactions in the intervention of analysis. The aim of the investigation must be to design and evaluate a participative project management as completion of the systems engineering process. The following participatory projects build the basis of investigation and evaluation: 1. Design of a new anaesthesia respirator and its man-machine interface. 2. Planing process of a new operating room facility. 3. Layout of a new facility for radiology. 4. Layout of an intensive care unit 5. Analysis of an emergency facility
