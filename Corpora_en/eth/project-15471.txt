Perturbative QCD Next to leading order QCD corrections to six leg processes Quantitative predictions for the most important physics signals measured at hadron colliders (Tevatron, LHC) and development of the necessary theoretical tools to carry out next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to leading order QCD processes.
