Structural Identification for Condition Assessment of Swiss Bridges Several of the components of the Swiss road network are at the point of their life span where a decision has to be taken concerning their potential repair or demolishment. The question of assessing the current condition of deteriorated infrastructure is addressed within this project. Structural Identification often referred to as (St-ID) is one of the core concepts of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Although the use of identification techniques for the monitoring of civil infrastructure has long been studied within the research community, it has so far only recently received increased attention when it comes to practical implementation. Certain pronounced failures in large civil structures could be credited as the trigger for this turning point; however it was more so the realization of dealing with an ageing infrastructure demographic that stressed the need for monitoring methods. Infrastructure operators in developed countries are currently more and more concerned with the number of structures approaching their design lifespan and are faced with decision making processes for the proper maintenance, repair and future use of structural systems. For the Swiss road system as well, the case is that several of the components of the network are at the point of their life span where a decision has to be taken concerning their potential repair or demolishment. The question of assessing the current condition of deteriorated civil infrastructure can be addressed with the use of proper Structural Identification techniques combined with appropriate testing schemes and the availability of appropriate response data from the structures in question. The scheme suggested herein aims at developing a testing process, accompanied by appropriate analysis methods, which can readily be adopted by ASTRA (FEDRO) towards decision making on the deteriorated components of the infrastructure network.
