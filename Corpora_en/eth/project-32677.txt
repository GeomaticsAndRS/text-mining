BfE - Development of advanced CFD models and improved experimental facilities targeted at dual fuel combustion systems suitable for a wide range of liquid- vs. gaseous content. This project seeks to develop 3D-CRFD models for the combustion of lean premixed CH4 charges ignited by variable amounts of high pressure Diesel spray at engine relevant conditions. The project co-founds the parallel CCEM projects SCHE-dual as well as Flex-FI-Dual .
