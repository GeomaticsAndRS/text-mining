Asymmetric cell division and organogenesis Organs originate from a few cells and need to be maintained over the live span of an organism. Organ formation and its maintenance were dependent on asymmetric cell divisions in invertebrate experimental systems. We test if asymmetric divisions occur in and control mammalian epithelial morphogenesis
