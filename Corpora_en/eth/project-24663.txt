Effect of ceria morphology on oxygen storage properties Nanostructured ceria materials show different and advantageous properties compared to microsized or bulk-like ceria structures. But, the associated structural, chemical, and electronic changes in CeO2 at low dimensions are still far from clear. Using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), having .. Nanostructured ceria materials show different and advantageous properties compared to microsized or bulk-like ceria structures. But, the associated structural, chemical, and electronic changes in CeO2 at low dimensions are still far from clear. Using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), having hydrogen as reaction probe, we aim to differentiate and quantify different types of oxygen species in ceria of different sizes. We aim to determine the relation between the structure and reactivity using different synchrotronbased characterization techniques, such as X-ray adsorption spectroscopy and pair distribution analysis.
