SignBus - Using additional signals to provide priority to buses at signalized intersections In urban environments, where buses and cars operate in mixed fashion, bus delays can be exacerbated at signalized intersections due to the interactions with cars. This research will investigate the use of additional signals to provide priority to buses at signalized intersections... In urban environments, where buses and cars operate in mixed fashion, bus delays can be exacerbated at signalized intersections due to the interactions with cars. This research will investigate the use of additional signals to provide priority to buses at signalized intersections, while minimizing the negative effects to cars. The goal is to obtain a complete understanding of the effects of implementing the proposed strategies on system-wide traffic operations (i.e., across both modes at the network level).
