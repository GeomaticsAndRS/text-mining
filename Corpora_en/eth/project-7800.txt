Silicon Microstrip Detector for AMS The aim of the Silicon microstrip detector for the Alpha Magnet Spectrometer (AMS) is to measure the charged particle momentum vector, including the sign of the charge, and to provide an absolute measurement of the particle charge. It is a six layer fully solid state system, which means low power, low voltages and high reliability and stability during the long operational period in outer space anticipated. The detector system is built from ladders mounted on ultra-light, space qualified CFK discs, developed in collaboration with space industry. Each ladder is up to 60 cm long, composed of up to 15 double sided Silicon sensors. Two hybrids carry the front end electronics for the p- and n-sides, respectivily. On the p-side, there are 640 channels read by ten 64 channels, AC coupled, charge sensitive preamplifier chips, followed by flash analog to digital converters (FADC). On the n-side, there are 384 channels, read accordingly. The hybrids are placed at 90$^{o}$with respect to the ladder plane and connected to the Silicon strips through copper plated microlithographied Kapton routers. Each hybrid reads one detector side. The p-strips, which run parallel to the B field and measure the bending coordinate, are ultrasonic bonded together and then ultrasonic bonded through a short Kapton router to the coupling capacitors located on the hybrid. The n-strips, which run perpendicular to the magnetic field, are read through a Kapton router up to 60 cm long, which is then connected to the coupling capacitors. Several n-strips are daisy chained to the same readout channel to reduce the number of readout channels on the n-side by an order of magnitude. This layout introduces an ambiguity in the non-bending coordinate, which can be resolved during the event reconstruction.
