3D Scan Completion This project addresses the problem of obtaining a complete and consistent digital 3D model representation from incomplete surface scans using a database of existing geometric models This project investigates a novel approach for obtaining a complete and consistent 3D model representation from incomplete surface scans, using a database of 3D shapes to provide geometric priors for regions of missing data. The central ideo is to retrieve suitable context models from the database, warp the retrieved models to conform with the input data, and consistently blend the warped models to obtain the final consolidated 3D shape. This requires the definition of a shape matching penalty function and corresponding optimization scheme for computing the non-rigid alignment of the context models with the input data to allow a quantitative evaluation and comparison of the quality of the shape extrapolation provided by each model. The algorithms are explicitly designed to accommodate uncertain data and can thus be applied directly to raw scanner output. The information gained during the shape completion process can be utilized for future scans, thus continuously simplifying the creation of complex 3D models.
