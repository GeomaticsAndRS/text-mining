N-confused porphyrins Few ligands have been as extensively studied as porphyrins, which play a decisive role in biology, catalysis and material sciences. The transition metal chemistry of regular porphyrins is well understood, whereas the complexes of derived tetrapyrrolic macrocycles have not been investigated in detail. A quite new class of porphyrin isomers is 2-aza-21-carbaporphyrin and its derivatives. This isomer is the only one retaining the molecular frame of the regular porphyrin. One or more of the core pyrrolic nitrogens are pointing out of the macrocycle, in return for one or more carbon atoms occupying the interior positions. The singly N-confused porphyrin was first isolated as a minor byproduct of a pyrrole-benzaldehyde co-condensation. The limited yields could be increased a couple of years ago leading to an exponential growth in the investigation of the N-confused porphyry metal chemistry. Their ability to act as tetra coordinate legends in combination with the payroll ring confusion allows the formation of rare oregano- metallic complexes like the ones of nickel) and coppery) with metal-carbon bonds. Studying the N-confused porphyry complexes of coppery), which can be considered as a model compound to get insight into reaction mechanism of metalloenzymes and catalysis, and cobalt(II) by the means of modern pulse EPR techniques helps revealing the considerable differences in the electronic and geometric structure caused by the confusion of the pyrrole ring.
