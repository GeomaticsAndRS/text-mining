Construction and use of large macromolecular repertoires for the isolation of novel bindingproteins and enzymes Advances in Protein Engineering and in combinatorial mutagenesis technologies have made it possible to clone and express repertoires of proteins, containing > 1 billion mutants carrying mutations at judiciously chosen aminoacid positions. In the past, we have cloned a large phage-display library of human antibody fragments (the ETH2 library ) from which more than hundred binding specificities have already been isolated. Furthermore we have cloned large phage-display libraries of mutants of three small globular proteins (EDA and EDB domains of fibronectin, and the N-terminal domain of the 434 repressor), for which we had previously solved the three-dimensional structure, in collaboration with Prof. K. Wüthrich. We are using these and other protein repertoires for the isolation of high-affinity binders against tumor markers and/or markers of angiogenesis. Furthermore, we have developed methodologies for the selection of novel enzymes and/or binding proteins from large macromolecular repertoires, without the use of filamentous phage. We have recently robotized the isolation of human antibodies from the ETH2 library, and we are in the position to raise antibodies against 10 different antigens/week, without immunization.
