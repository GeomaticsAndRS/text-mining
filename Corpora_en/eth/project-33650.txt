Unlocking the mechanisms of mechanotransduction in degenerative disc disease: The role of TRP channels Using an interdisciplinary approach (engineering, biology, medicine, pharmacology) ranging from in vitro cell and tissue culture studies to in vivo knockout studies, this project will aim to identify the mechanisms of mechanotransduction that are involved in disc pathology.
