Charging and Accounting Technologies for the Internet (CATI) The project CATI consists of two subprojects, one focues on Internet protocols to support charging and accounting for existing and future Internet services, and another one that demonstrates these technolgies with real-world applications. The main goals of the first project proposal on Charging and Accounting in the Internet and in Virtual Private Networks - CAPIV cover the following ones: - Design and implementation of charging and accounting mechanisms based on currently available protocols of the Internet protocol suite, focussing on secured, reservation-based approaches. - Design and implementation of a VPN configuration service including charging and accounting functions, best-effort services, differentiated services alternatives, fairness and congestion control mechanisms to ensure that customer traffic is handled fairly and securely. - Development of generic support functionality (APIs) for Internet-based open Electronic Commerce. The main goals of this second project proposal on Management, Evaluation, Demonstrators, and Business - MEDeB cover the following ones: - Development and demonstration of an IP Phone, which employs the implemented charging and accounting functionality and makes use of QoS-support in existing Internet protocols. - Investigation and definition of business models for Internet services for the Internet, which include Internet Service Provider network costs and pricing schemes with respect to traditional, best-effort IP services and the integrated services Internet architecture. - Evaluation of developed Internet charging and accounting mechanisms based on Internet services business models for the Internet, which include Internet Service Provider network costs and pricing schemes, the demonstrator application as well as regular traffic.
