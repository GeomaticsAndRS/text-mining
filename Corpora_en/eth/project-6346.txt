Occupational Health - Environmental Hygiene: Air Monitoring Concept in Cities of Latin America Air pollution is considered to be a major environmental problem in cities of Latin America according to an opinion survey of urban people. The main reason for this is second hand car export from the US at a remarkable growth rate of 15 to 20% a year. Diesel powered lorries and buses are especially the cause for odour and particles. A Swiss project, under the leadership of the Swisscontact foundation, has the goal of introducing a car inspection and maintainance program in Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica. At the present time the legal base for technical measures such as catalysators and lead free petrol are supported in collaboration with the responsible authorities. These activities are supported by a public relations campaign to raise the consciousness of the population on environmental issues. An air monitoring program is essential for this campaign to show the effects of the technical measures. The main requirements for of air monitoring in countries of the third world is simplicity of the methods, no technical dependence on highly sophisticated equipment and low cost. Convenient and sustainable methods are by the use of diffusive monitors for gaseous pollutants, which do not need any electricity and maintainance.At two universities and one state agency, methods for measuring carbon monoxide, particles, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and hydrocarbons were introduced. Seven to ten monitoring sites were selected in each capital city to characterize different pollution levels in the capital cities. Personal training is carried out and a quality assurance system will be introduced. The first results show that levels of total suspended particulates and nitrogen dioxide are two to three times higher than WHO guidelines. Project completed in 2001.
