Numerical studies of disordered and complex systems The aim of this project is to obtain a deeper understanding of the physics of complex and glassy systems, such as spin glasses, structural glasses, vortex glasses, quantum glasses, and topologically-protected quantum computing implementations. The inclusion of disorder in the study of physical systems poses demanding analytical, as well as numerical challenges. Most prominent representatives of disordered systems are spin glasses. However, despite ongoing research for several decades in the area of glassy systems, there remain many open questions. The equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of spin glasses is an intensely studied field, posing formidable theoretical, computational and experimental challenges in the description of disordered magnetic systems, and also serving as a paradigm for other problems, such as biological sequence analysis, combinatorial optimization problems, and hysteresis modeling in magnetic recording media. Using numerical methods, such as parallel tempering Monte Carlo and cluster algorithms we aim to deeper understand the properties of glassy and complex systems. Current ongoing projects: Existence of an Almeida-Thouless line in short-range spin glasses. Study of universality in Ising spin glasses. Hysteresis modeling using disordered magnets. Green's function Monte Carlo studies of quantum dimer models. Computation of error thresholds for topologically-protected quantum computing models
