Design of Key Components for ACTS Project Magic WAND ~ In the EC ACTS project Magic http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/wand/WAND\rh (Wireless ATM Network Demonstrator) a non-constant envelope modulation, OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), is investigated for use in future high-speed wireless ATM systems at 5 and 17 GHz. OFDM requires linear high efficiency power amplifiers. In the key components part of the project, power amplifiers at 5 and 17 GHz are designed and tested. These power amplifiers are built as integrated circuits (MMIC), because there is nothing available on the market today which fits the combined needs regarding linearity, efficiency and size for application in a mobile terminal. Commercial MESFET and HEMT foundry processes are used for circuit fabrication. Other components of receivers and transmitters, such as local oscillators and mixers, are also being investigated. These components are built as hybrid circuits (MIC) because of shorter development cycles. The design process is based on the extensive use of nonlinear simulation to predict the circuit performance before fabrication.
