Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer in Chemical Reacting Systems Thermal radiative transport coupled to the reaction kinetics is analyzed for heterogeneous chemical systems in which optical properties, species composition, and phases vary as the chemical reaction progresses. This research theme has fundamental significance to several energy-related fields such as combustion, advanced materials processing, atmospheric sciences, and solar chemistry. Of special interest is the transient radiative exchange within absorbing-emitting-scattering particle suspensions, applied in thermochemical processes such as thermal cracking, gasification, reforming, decomposition, and reduction processes. Methodology - Monte-Carlo ray tracing and band-approximation radiosity methods for treating non-gray non-isothermal participating media undergoing chemical transformations and having directional and wavelength dependent optical properties.
