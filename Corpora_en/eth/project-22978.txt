Active Knee Prosthetics Our focus lies on the interface and the control of an active knee prosthesis. Though having in mind that a final solution has to be self-contained, meaning that energy supply, actuator and control architecture have to be integrated in the prosthesis, we perform research on cable-bound prototypes. Human capabilities to coordinate movements during walking are much better than what can currently be achieved by robots. After the loss of a leg due to amputation, those capabilities generally still exist, but the human has to adapt to a prosthetic replacement, which behaves quite differently from its natural counterpart. In recent years, intelligent knee prostheses have become commercially available that allow quite natural gait under certain conditions. However, almost all those devices are passive and can only dissipate energy. With continuous improvements in energy storage and actuator technology, knee prostheses that actively generate kinetic energy become feasible and could potentially come closer to the biomechanical ideal of physiological gait.
