A Self Consistent Particle-in-Cell Finite Element Time Domain Solver for Large Accelerator Structures This research project focuses on efficiently solving self-consistent Maxwellâ€™s equations in large and complex shaped accelerator structures of the first part of the PSIFEL/LEG1 project. Our prime goal is a quantitative and self-consistent modeling of the injector in the PSI-FEL/LEG project.
