Characteristics of GPS Antenna and Multipath Effects Study the electrical characteristics of the antenna and investigate possible sources, which affect the reception conditions, considering the physics of the atmosphere and the diffraction/reflection in the vicinity of the antenna (multipath effects). The efficiency and gain of GPS antennas depend not only on propagation conditions within the atmosphere but also on the electrical characteristics of the antenna (antenna pattern). The scope of this project is to study and compare different antenna types as well as to investigate possible sources which affect the reception conditions either via the physics of the atmosphere or via reflections in the vicinity of the antenna (multipath effects). Multipath is still an issue for ground based augmentation systems (GBAS) for approaches. Multipath effects are investigated in co-operation with skyguide at planned GBAS sites like Zurich airport. Low cost GPS equipment gain interest in geodetic application. Therefore, low-cost antennas are also investigated.
