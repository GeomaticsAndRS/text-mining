Man Machine Interaction - Computer Aided Learning: Cognitive Usability by Means of the Interface We are investigating if the conventional definition of usability, which favours direct manipulation, automatically produces the best performance. Since the introduction of direct manipulation as a method of interacting with the computer, the accepted attitude has been that it represents a better and more user friendly way of interaction. Command based interaction requires that the users interact with the computer by describing the actions they wish to be performed. Such user interfaces increase the gap between action and feedback. Command based interfaces can create a feeling of indirectness, because the interface is an implied intermediary between the user and the actions. Our research supports the findings in other experiments which report that command and direct manipulation interfaces can induce the users to employ different learning strategies. The optimal strategy for learning depends upon the characteristics of the task. Several experiments are designed to compare different aspects of the material to be learned (complexity, degree of structuring) with different user interfaces. The goal is to specify different interfaces and task characteristics which together promote learning. This research focuses on the cognitive aspects of the interface when evaluating interactive interfaces for learning systems.
