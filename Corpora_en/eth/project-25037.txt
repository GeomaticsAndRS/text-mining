Quality and capacity of public transport on streets The object of the research of the research project is to develop standard values and measurement methods for quality and capacity of public transport on streets to get the missing information and data for the existing norms ,,capacity, quality of traffic conditions, capacitance". Unlike to the usual quality of traffic conditions, the perspective for the consideration of quality of public transport has to expand to a bifocal perspective. T ¸ Customer: result oriented, subjective consideration -> quality of service T ¸ Transport operator: process orientated, technical consideration -> quality of operation / capacity For the quality of service and the quality of operation / capacity the following transport systems were analyzed by detailed literature studys, existing norms and guidelines, available results of other empirical investigations, new data collections and models to get representative values and methods for swiss conditions. T ¸ Tramways T ¸ Regular (trolley-) busses T ¸ Bussystems on demand Busses on demand operate if there is only low demand and therefore the consideration will be different from other systems. Especially aspects like planning of ressources and waiting times of customers are important. First, relevant parameters for the description of quality and capacity of public transport will be evaluated and fixed due to the findings of detailed literature studys and existing project results. Needed data will be collected and analyzed. Second, based on the first steps, standard values and measurement methods of the quality of service and the quality of operation / capacity are elaborated in dependence on the fixed parameters. A system of level of services will be elaborated as well. Due to the findings, suggestions for measurement methods for the different public transport systems, and operational types are to be developed.
