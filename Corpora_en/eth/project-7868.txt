Self-Aligned Fiber to Waveguide Array Coupling Technique As the packaging of OEIC chips requires submicron precision for the optical connections between waveguide components and single mode fibers (SMF), self-alignment technologies, especially important for fiber array connections, are needed, which allow to reduce critical positioning and fastening steps. The good thermal and mechanical properties of Si combined with the possibility to fabricate precise V-grooves for fiber to waveguide alignments together with electrical connection techniques make them appropriate as mounting boards for OEIC's. We developed a flip-chip packaging technique for OEIC's on Si motherboards, which combines self-aligned optical array coupling between waveguides and SMF's with flexible beam-lead electronic interconnections. Anisotropically etched V-grooves, 250 \gmm spaced to allow the use of fiber ribbons, provide the self-alignment. The v-groove sidewalls are used for the positioning of both the fibers and the turned over OEIC with the alignment indentations etched parallel to the waveguides. Switch matrices, laser and amplifier array have been packaged with arrays of 4 fibers per side using this self-aligned flip-chip technique on Si motherboard.
