CCEM SCHE-Dual The present project is aiming at the further development of both Diesel and dual-fuel engines towards higher efficiency and lower emissions. This requires a better understanding of the fundamental in-cylinder phenomena through experimental measurements and state-of-the-art reactive CFD simulations.
