Using New Geochemical and Nanotechnological Approach to Study Biomineralization in Microbiolites This project proposes to study living stromatolites and microbial mats under laboratory conditions, which is a significant step towards to provide clues to understand ancient biochemical processes. In additon, the new clumped isotope paleothermometer for dolomite will be calibrated.
