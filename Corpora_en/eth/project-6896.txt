Theory of Chemical Reactions This project deals with fundamental theoretical considerations about the mechanisms and dynamics of chemical reactions. Among the problems addressed are: Quantum dynamics and statistical mechanics of chemical reactions, intrinsic quantum effects (including tunneling), symmetry selection rules for chemical reactions, transition state theory, parity violating weak nuclear interaction and the kinetics of racemisation in chiral, enantiomeric molecules, time reversal symmetry and reversible and irreversible unimolecular reactions.
