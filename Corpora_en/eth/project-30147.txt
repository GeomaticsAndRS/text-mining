Fluid-Rock Interaction and Fluid Fluxes in Mafic and Ultramafic Seafloor: Peridotite-hosted Hydrothermal Systems Past and Present This is a study of the petrology, geochemistry, and isotopic compositions in ultramafic-hosted seafloor systems in Liguria, Italy and the Lost City hydrothermal system, Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Emphasis is on fluid flow and deformation, fluid fluxes, and hydrothermal carbonate precipitation.
