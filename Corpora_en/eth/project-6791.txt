Self-replication of Micelles and Liposomes and Chemical Autopoiesis Whether and to what extent geometrically closed chemical structures are able to self-replicate is an important question, as it ties chemistry with basic cellular processes. In the last couple of years, we have been successful in developing some micellar (and partly liposomal) systems which were able to increase their number owing to a chemical reaction which takes place within the domain of the micelle (or liposome). The work is now proceeding along the following lines: i) development of novel reverse micellar systems that are able to replicate; ii) development of vesicles and liposomes that are able to self-replicate.
