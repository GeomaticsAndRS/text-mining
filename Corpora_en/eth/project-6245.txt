Flow Modeling of Rock Glaciers The principal objective of the project is to improve the general understanding of the genesis and the mechanical behaviour of rock glaciers. In particular, hypotheses regarding the flow and the thermal structure of rock glaciers will be tested in a series of numerical experiments. Many of the characteristic geometrical features of rock glaciers, such as furrow-ridge structures and shape of the advancing fronts, are thought to be primarily related to the internal flow mechanics of these glaciers, rather than to external factors such as differential ablation or debris supply. We intend to test a number of hypotheses relating to flow of rock glaciers by performing a set of well defined numerical experiments. For this purpose we use a recently developed numerical flow model which describes the transient evolution of a gravitydriven creeping viscous medium with a free surface. The numerical model solves the full set of the momentum equations, and follows exactly the transient evolution of the free surface. This type of a numerical model differs considerably from models based on zeroth- or first-order approximations that are often used in glaciological modeling work. By model-model comparison of the transient evolution of idealized rock glaciers calculated both with a zeroth-order and full-system flow models, the need for using higher-order models for analyzing the flow regime of rock glaciers is investigated. To understand the impact of temperature changes on the flow behaviour of rock glaciers, we employ a one-dimensional model which simulates the temporal and spatial distribution of temperature in the rock glacier material. The velocities of the rock glacier are calculated using a flow model with a temperature dependent rate factor. Measured temperatures in a borehole in Schafberg rock glacier are used to calibrate and verify the thermal model used as input for the flow model.
