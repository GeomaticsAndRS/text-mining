Pollinator attraction by CO2 produced by Sapria himalayana (Rafflesiaceae) in northern Thailand The goal of the project is to assess a) if the flowers of Sapria himalayana are endothermic, like other flowers in the Rafflesiaceae, b) if they produce large quantities of CO2, c), most important, if these factors play a role in the pollination and thus seed production of this rare species. The Sapria flowers are studied in the montane monsoon forests near Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. Temperatures are measured with very thin Pt-100 thermometers, CO2 with a soil respiration measurement equipment. Preliminary results suggest that the Sapria flowers are not endothermic (i.e. do not accumulate heat) but produce very large quantities of CO2. What these findings mean ecologically is the task of further investigations.
