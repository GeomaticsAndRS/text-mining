Efficient 3D tooth surface integration In our project we provide the knowledge and algorithms that allow stitching of teeth scans into one coherent mesh at interactive rates. In particular the individual scans are registered using fast Iterative Closest Point and integrated into a consistent In our project we provide the knowledge and algorithms that allow stitching of teeth scans into one coherent mesh at interactive rates. In particular the individual scans are registered using fast Iterative Closest Point and integrated into a consistent point cloud model. This is possible as the scans are acquired at interactive rates and the individual scans are already in approximate alignment. A consistency check detects and discards wrongly registered scans. The user of the scanner can interactively see the reconstructed model and see what parts have not yet been scanned. It is the users task to move the scanner so that all parts haven been seen. In order for users to stop and restart scanning we will investigate ways to register two or more point cloud models.
