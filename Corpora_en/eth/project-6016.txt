Experimental Modelling of the Passivity of Iron and Iron Chromium Alloys The stability of the passive state of metals and alloys is influenced by the electrical (semiconductive) characteristics of the oxide film and its chemical stability in the environment. Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical in-situ investigations of passive films on stainless steels have revealed the semiconductive nature of these thin oxide films. In this work bulk metal oxides prepared by coprecipitation or sol-gel processes and sputtered metal oxide layers with varying stochiometry shall provide a more detailed knowledge of the influence of structure and composition of the oxides on the electrical properties and on the chemical stability. The correlation of these results with the stability of the oxide will reveal the influence of alloying elements in stainless steels on their corrosion resistance. The system FeCr-O will be described with these methods. Of special interest is the investigation of the influence of small amounts of molybdenum on the stability of the oxide.
