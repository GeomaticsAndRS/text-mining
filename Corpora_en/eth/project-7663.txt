Mechanical Characteristics of Ceramic-Metal Seals Efforts are being made to combine the thougness and reliability of metalswith the resistance of ceramics (heat, abrasion and chemical inertia). Onesolution consists in welding metal with ceramics. The ceramic-metal sealhas to be tested. This can be realised with the use of ultrasonic waves orX-rays but also with the following procedure:The quality of a weld has an influence on the dynamic behaviour of thestructure like resonance frequencies or structural wave propagation (wherethe wavelength is much larger than the thickness of the structure). This isthe basis for two additional methods for non-destructive testing of joints.The correlation between the global stiffness of the weld determined withthe help of these two methods with local methods like ultrasonic waves orXrays facilitates the quantitative characterisation of the ceramic-metalseal.Structures with different geometries (first of all rods, then plates,tubes, shells) will be tested with all four methods (IfM: resonancefrequencies and wave propagation; EMPA: ultrasonic waves and X-rays). Theresults will be compared with theoretical models.
