Low Temperature Properties of Systems with Low Carrier Concentration The problem of metal-insulator transitions is not new and in trivial cases may be understood by simple band-structure arguments. Later developments of electron localization by correlation effects or disorder have been studied extensively. More recently, electron localization via Kondo effect and in compounds with intrinsically low carrier concentration have become of interest. At present we investigate the ground state of the cubic compound FeSi, whose low-temperature properties escape simple explanations. Detailed studies employing various experimental techniques have been and are made using single crystals of FeSi, grown by vapour transport. On polycrystalline material we study the influence of replacing either Fe or Si by small amounts of adjacent elements like Co, Mn, Rh and Ru. The characterization is achieved by measurements of thermal and transport properties, always carried out on the same sample because even small material variations may distinctly alter the behaviour. These measurements are complemented by optical experiments, also probing the electronic excitation spectrum.
