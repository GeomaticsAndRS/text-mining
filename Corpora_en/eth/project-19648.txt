Energy metabolism in Diabetes assessed by proton and multinuclear MR spectroscopy and MRI Diabetes patients suffer from a distortion of the muscle energy metabolism and energy storage mechanisms. Hence, this project aims at investigation of physical excersise as a therapy form observing muscle fat and glycogen content and the muscle energy metabolism using 31P, 13C, and 1H MRS and MRI
