Design and study of new catalytic systems for efficient water splitting The project aim is to develop specially designed structure-controlled molecular ruthenium catalysts, using bisbenzimidazole as rigid ligand matrix. Appropriately adjusting the ligands sphere of ruthenium allows creating catalysts with enhanced activity toward water oxidation. The project aim is to develop specially designed structure-controlled molecular ruthenium catalysts, using bisbenzimidazole as rigid ligand matrix. Appropriately adjusting the ligands sphere of ruthenium allows creating catalysts with enhanced activity toward water oxidation. The catalysts performances can be greatly improved by embedding the ruthenium complex onto a solid frame, for instance by anodic electropolymerization of its N-substituted pyrol derivatives. The activity of the new catalysts toward water oxidation will be investigated by dynamic oxygen evolving measurements. The reaction mechanism will be determined by experimental mechanistic investigations based on kinetics and by theoretical computational studies.
