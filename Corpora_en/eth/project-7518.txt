Petrogenesis of Basanitic Dikes From the Austrian Alps Petrographic, geochemical, isotope geochemical and mineralogical characterisation of Cretaceous basanite dike rocks and their mantle inclusions (megacrysts) occurring in the Calcareous Alps of Western Austria. Experimental investigation of the high temperature phase relations to high pressures (4 GPa) to understand the genesis of basanitic melts in the upper mantle and to interpret the composition relations of the phenocrysts and the mantle derived xenocrysts.
