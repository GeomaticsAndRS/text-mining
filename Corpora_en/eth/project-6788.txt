Solubilization of Biopolymers and Microorganisms in OrganicSolvents via Water-in-oil Microemulsions The whole area is based on the finding that reverse micelles (also called w/o microemulsions) have the extraordinary capability of solubilizing proteins, enzymes, microorganisms such as yeast, bacteria, fungi, spores, plant cells; as well as nucleic acids and plasmids, without impairing their activity. In this way, one obtains enzyme solutions in, say, isooctane; or yeast suspensions in petrol, which are biologically active. This opens the way to enzymology or microbiology in essentially organic solvents (containing however a little water-up to 1% v:v minimum). This field has the goal of understanding the mechanism of enzyme action in novel environments, both for basic science and biotechnological applications. Much emphasis has been devoted to the use of reverse micelles for the extraction and separation of proteins. The finding that high-molecular-weight DNA, and even circular plasmids, could be solubilized in reverse micellar solutions was also very startling. Equally surprising was the observation that also unicellular organisms could be solubilized in reverse micellar solutions, maintaining their activity with as little as 35% water v:v. Our group was studying particularly the case of yeast and, more recently, cyanobacteria. PD Dr. Peter Walde has been supervising these various reverse micellar projects.
