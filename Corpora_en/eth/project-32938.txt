Microscale Nonlinear Crystals We conduct experiments on the dynamic interaction in micro-particles systems (10-300 um), including the dynamics collisions between micro-particles, the adhesive force and the local potential of different particles-surface contacts and mechanical solitary wave in granular systems at micro-scale.
