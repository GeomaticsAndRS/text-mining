Probability Cascades and Abstract Cavity Method The object of this project is to construct a certain Markov process which describes a clustering mechanism through which equivalence classes on the set N of nonnegative integers are progressively lumped together. This clustering process gives a new description of Ruelle's continuous probability cascades. It also enables to introduce an abstract cavity method, which mimicks certain features of the cavity method developed by Mezard, Parisi and Virasoro, in the context of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. The clustering process has also recently been the object of further developments through the work of Pitman who described a class of coalescent Markov processes including the Kingman coalescent as well as the above mentioned clustering process.
