Infrastructure Roadmap for Energy Networks in Europe (IRENE-40) The IRENE-40 project will identify strategies for investors and regulators to build a more secure, sustainable and competitive European electricity system. The strategies will be presented in a roadmap, i.e. a timeline with actions and a description of development stages over the next 40 years. The IRENE-40 project motivation originates in the context of an ageing electrical power system infrastructure and decreasing security margins in the European electricity transmission systems. Action impacting the future of the European electricity supply system in the coming 40 years is needed today as investment decisions are being made now that will open or close future pathways to a sustainable, secure and cost efficient system of the future. In this context the IRENE-40 project has been devised to meet the following research needs: - Development of a credible vision for technology, infrastructure and policy development to inform stakeholders and investors. - Tackle the challenge of utilising latent capacity in infrastructure across national networks without compromising system security and operation and maximising power trading opportunities. - Realisation of interconnection strategies between member states to create a single pan-European grid, including harmonisation of technical standards and development of new markets for crossborder trade. - Provision guidance and a coordinated strategy for development and investment against a backdrop of uncertainty. - Many emerging technologies are approaching readiness for use within networks. There is a need to define general deployment strategies as well as methods to assess these from a system perspective. - Technical countermeasures are required to alleviate risks and to increase ecological sustainability, security and competitiveness of electrical energy systems.
