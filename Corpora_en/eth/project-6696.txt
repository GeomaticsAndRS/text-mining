Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics): multiplatform multipackage development environment for statistical analysis, built on (X)Emacs. An international collaboration project with 6 main researchers, from ETH Zurich, TU Wien, U.Edinburgh, U.Washington(Seattle), Temple U.(Philadelphia) and Medical Coll.,WI For computational Statistics, it is important from a very practical point of view to have powerful and flexible tools, for prototyping new algorithms, programming, experimentation, simulation etc. We have found <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</A> to be our universal interface to entering all kinds of text and programs. <A HREF="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/">ESS</A> is free software to be installed on top of Emacs (or Xemacs) allowing interaction with <A HREF="http://www.R-project.org/">R</A> or <A HREF="http://www.insightful.com/">S-plus"</A> (for us), but also other statistics software such XLispStat, Stata, SAS, BUGS.
