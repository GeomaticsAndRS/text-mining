Atomic Force Microscopy for in-situ characterization of MBE-grown nanostructures Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) is one of the most versatile crystal growth techniques to tailor ultra-thin film structures of high purity with smooth interfaces. These structures can show properties not found in nature. One of the most important problems, however, is the optimization of the growth conditions (substrate temperature, deposition rate, stoechiometry of the different evaporation materials) to obtain the desired property. This optimization is done on the basis of well-defined experiments using different surface sensitive tools to quantify, e. g., film thickness, structure, and morphology. With respect to film morphology and defect structure, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has many advantages. This local probe, which can even resolve atoms of the surface, is used to extract microscopic parameter such as terrace diffusion of adatoms on the basis of experimental data and mean-field nucleation theory. On the other hand, these microscopic parameter are crucial inputs of simulations carried out to optimize the growth. Moreover, AFM is capable of resolving different kinds of defects which are responsible for desired and nondesired properties of the grown structures. Our special instrument enables measurements in both contact and noncontact mode, whereby the detection is done by a piezoresistive cantilever. By piezoelectrically driven translation stage an area of 800 mm2 can be reached on the 3-inch wafer. The samples as well as the AFM-tips can be changed via load lock and, in addition, transferred into the other chambers (OMBE, anorganic, preparation, surface analysis).
