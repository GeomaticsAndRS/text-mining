Simulation of Light Guiding Devices In the automotive industry, it is common practice to illuminate the instruments and icons on the dashboard with only a few light sources. This is realised by leading the light from the sources to the points of interest on the front panel using guiding devices which are usually made of Plexiglas (PMMA) or Lexan (PC). Similar applications of this lightning technique can be found in other devices where indicator lamps are mounted on printed circuit boards inside the housing unit (e.g. SMT-LED's) sending their light through the guidings to the panel. Reducing the number of light sources is usually desirable because this results in savings of space requirements and in less power consumption and thereby less waste heat. For security and ergonomic reasons, it is required that the icons and indicators are lit with an even brightness and that the instruments are uniformly illuminated. This is a difficult task for the designer, because the guiding devices often have complex spatial shapes due to mounting constraints. Our intention is to develop software which analyses the geometric model entered on a CAD system, and computes the resulting brightnesses and laminar illumination distributions. The simulation is based on tracing rays from the light sources to the areas of interest. To obtain reliable results, a large number of rays have to be cast and traced. Our major goals are then to (1) enhance the tracing algorithm and (2) find models of light sources with efficient ray casting strategies.
