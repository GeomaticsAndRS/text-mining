Magnetic Properties of Ferric Hydroxides and Schwertmannite Ferric hydroxides and schwertmannite are paramagnetic at room temperature, but undergo magnetic ordering at low temperature. Low temperature magnetic properties for 2-line and 6-line ferrihydrite, ferritin and schwertmannite are being investigated.
