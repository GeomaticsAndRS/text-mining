IPFM (individualized parametric facade-modules with decentralized building services) IPFM(individualized parametric facade-modules with decentralized building services) has the goal to investigate the production of parametric fa√ßade-modules with integrated building services in a new building model. Parametrics in planning and production enable demanding energetic requirements as wel
