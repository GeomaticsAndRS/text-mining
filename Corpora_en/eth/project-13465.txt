Investigations of High Temperature Superconductors Neutron scattering is employed to investigate both the magnetic excitations and the Abrikosov phase diagram of high-temperature supercondcutors. The results are then confronted to both theroetical and experimental results obtained form other probe like, for example, ARPES, tunneling or transport. The doping (x)-temperature phase diagram of HTSC turns out to be very rich. While the undoped system is antiferromagnetic (AF) and insulating, doping with holes or electrons destroys, the Néel state. The system enters then a spin-glass phase and upon further doping superconductivity appears below a critical temperature Tc. In the underdoped (UD) regime Tc increases with increasing x and the system behaves like a strange metal. Tc then reaches an optimum (Opt) and decreases again (overdoped (OD) regime. Although the exact mechanism leading to HTSC remains unknown, the last 2 decades have seen a tremendous progress in the understanding of these materials. Some of the important experimental findings are: 1) Evidence for a d-wave superconducting gap function (ARPES and tunneling [1]). 2) In the UD regime, NMR, Raman, hall effect, specific heat, ARPES, tunneling and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments have demonstrated the existence of a pseudogap [2] well above Tc, both in the charge and spin sectors. This pseudogap closes at a temperature T* that is increasing with decreasing doping. A quantum critical point that would separate UD and OD regimes as been as well postulated. 3) Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments have revealed the existence of wellUdefined (commensurate and incommensurate) magnetic excitations, both in the superconducting and normal states [3]. c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved. Last updated: 06.08.2004 <page 2> 4) Muon spin rotation, neutron crystal field (CF) and very recent tunneling experiments have shown, in the UD regime, a tendency toward an electronic phase separation [4]. 5) While ?SR has demonstrated that the superconducting condensate scales roughly with the doping level x, ARPES as shown that the Fermi surface is consistent with 1+x [5]. 6) Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments have recently revealed the existence of a field-induced phase transition from hexagonal to square in HTSC, indicating the coupling of the vortices to some in-plane anisotropy (SC gap or Fermi velocity?). At higher temperatures and fields, the vortex lattice melts into the so-called vortex-liquid state [6]. doping concentration x=1/8 (UD) 7) ?SR experiments in LSCO clearly show that at the Smagical ¸ T a decrease of Tc is accompanied by enhanced antiferro-magnetism [7], INS experiments in the vortex phase have shown the existence of field-induced magnetic correlations [8] (static close to x=1/8 or dynamic close to optimum) together with an unusual interplay between the spin- and vortex-dynamics. Medium-term research perspectives The above-mentioned results constitute the pieces of a puzzle that remains to be assembled. Therefore, in order to better understand the links existing between the electronic, magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom in these materials, several projects involving various experimental techniques (both within PSI and outside) have been initiated. It is our belief that such a multi-disciplinary approach represents the most promising path toward a better understanding of strongly correlated systems in general, and of HTSC in particular. A) Magnetic vs electronic properties INS, mSR and ARPES investigations of both the magnetic and electronic excitations in various HTSC as a function of doping, temperature or magnetic field. These studies aim at investigating, at a quantitative level, whether or not the observed spin excitations can be explained by Fermi-liquid like models. In order to achieve this goal a collaboration with the theory group of the NUM department has recently been initiated. B) Vortex phase Investigation of the (electron and hole) doping and temperature dependence of the vortex lattice by means of SANS and ?SR measurements to understand the origin of both the field-induced phase transition and the microscopic nature of the vortex-liquid state.
