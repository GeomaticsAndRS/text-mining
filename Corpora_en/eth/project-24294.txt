Mixed Integer Cutting Plane Theory This research topic aims at developing an algorithmic theory for solving mixed integer linear optimization problems by means of cutting plane methods. This theory establishes a link to the study of maximally lattice point free convex sets. This research topic is devoted to a study of mixed integer optimization problems, i.e., systems of linear inequalities and equations for which parts of the variables are continous and the other part is required to be integral. In comparison to the pure integer case the presence of both types of variables results in a significant increase in complexity with respect to geometric, algebraic and combinatorial properties. Special emphasis in this project is on a new geometric approach towards solving such mixed integer optimization problems by means of a cutting plane algorithm. Indeed, the cutting planes arise from lattice point free polyhedra and conversely, lattice point free polyhedra give rise to cuttting planes. Current research questions are related to the study of the strength of such cuts, the issue of separating them, the property of finite termination of cutting plane algorithms based on subfamilies of such cuts and on general structural results about the characterization of maximally lattice point free polyhedra.
