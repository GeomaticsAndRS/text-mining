Multi-Perspective Stereoscopy from Light Fields This project addresses stereoscopic view generation from a light field. We present a framework that allows for the generation of stereoscopic image pairs with per-pixel control over disparity, based on multi-perspective imaging from light fields. This project addresses stereoscopic view generation from a light field. We present a framework that allows for the generation of stereoscopic image pairs with per-pixel control over disparity, based on multi-perspective imaging from light fields. The proposed framework is novel and useful for stereoscopic image processing and post-production. The stereoscopic images are computed as piecewise continuous cuts through a light field, minimizing an energy reflecting prescribed parameters such as depth budget, maximum disparity gradient, desired stereoscopic baseline, and so on. As demonstrated in our results, this technique can be used for efficient and flexible stereoscopic post-processing, such as reducing excessive disparity while preserving perceived depth, or retargeting of already captured scenes to various view settings. Moreover, we generalize our method to multiple cuts, which is highly useful for content creation in the context of multi-view autostereoscopic displays. We present several results on computer-generated content as well as live-action content.
