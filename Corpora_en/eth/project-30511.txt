Understanding individual level attitudes towards trade The project investigates how citizens form their attitudes towards trade liberalization using survey experiments. We strive to understand whether economic or non-economic factors are more important in determining who is in favor and against economic globalization. Depending on the theoretical trade model, different variables should influence individualsS attitude towards globalization. Whereas the factor endowment model highlights skill level and capital ownership as the drivers behind a personSs trade preferences, the specific sector model points to sectoral employment as the important explanatory variable. Researchers have come to different conclusions as to whether individualsS trade preferences depend on their skills (i.e. their education), their income or the sector in which they are employed. In principle, this lack of coherent findings could have various reasons, such as the use of different datasets, measurement problems or specification errors. We argue that one needs to approach this incoherence in empirical findings from a theoretical perspective and that the predictions of the different trade models are not mutually exclusive. A person can be highly skilled but work in a sector threatened by globalization. Hence this person could at the same time profit and lose from an increase in globalization. Furthermore, the same person could embrace globalization, if he thinks of himself as a consumer, whereas he might oppose globalization due to his political attitude. Consequently, our project aims to shed more light on the question of which is the dominant conceptualization of an individual when evaluating globalization. We rely on survey experiments to be able to differentiate in which mindset (consumer, worker, well-educated academic) a specific individual thinks when asked for an opinion on globalization.
