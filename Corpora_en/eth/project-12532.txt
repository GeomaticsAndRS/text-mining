Chronology of Glaciations with in-situ Cosmogenic Noble Gases and Radionuclides Our goal is to study inter-hemispheric synchrony of paleoclimate events. Specifically we address a) the time structure of the Last Glacial Maximum and its decay phases until the Younger Dryas cold reversal, b) the question of global synchrony of these events
