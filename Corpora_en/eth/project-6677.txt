Linear Unmixing: Multivariate Models for Identifying Emission Sources of Pollutants from AmbientAir Monitoring Stations Current monitoring measurement of air pollutants in ambient air include many chemical compounds (such as volatile hydrocarbons) in hourly time resolution. Suppose that the pollution is generated by a small number of emission sources, each of which emits constant proportions of different chemical compounds. This ideal leads to so-called linear mixing models, which are related to Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis. These models appear in many other Areas throughout science. One part of our project deals with developing and using graphical methods and numerical tools which prove very helpful in identifying and interpreting the sources. Work has started to develop methods which make use of additional information such as approximate external knowledge of source compositions and variables which may be correlated with source activities. A generalization is planned to extend the model to allow for chemical degradation reactions in ambient air. The methods are implemented in the S language. A script file which guides through the analysis of linear mixing data is available, and we plan to turn the material into an R package. As another part of the project, a PhD thesis which treats unmixing models in greater depth has just been finished. Marcel Wolbers develops a stochastic model for the problem, describes algorithms for estimating its parameters and examines the statistical properties of these procedures. He also collects many helpful hints for analysing data sets. Publications based on the thesis are planned.
