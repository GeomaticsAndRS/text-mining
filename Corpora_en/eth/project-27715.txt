Automated reduction of detailed reaction mechanisms and use in muti-dimensional combustion simulations The project aim is to further develop and implement the automated model reduction of detailed reaction mechanisms in a highly-scalable parallel code for the simulation of low Mach number combustion. The code will be used to study hydrocarbon flames.
