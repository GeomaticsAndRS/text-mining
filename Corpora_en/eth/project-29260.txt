Gene mining to combat drought stress and phosphorous deficiency in rice Drought is one of the most significant stresses in global agriculture and is closely linked with problem soils, especially phosphorus deficient soils. We apply transcriptome sequencing to identify novel genes that are specifically expressed in roots of tolerant rice varieties. More than half of the worldSs population depends on rice as the main staple food. Most of the rice farmers and consumers live in Asia and Africa with a large proportion of urban and rural poor. Considering the growing population and climatic changes that increasingly threaten rice production, it is critically important to develop new rice varieties that maintain high yield and good grain quality under adverse conditions. Drought is recognized as one of the most significant environmental stresses in global agriculture and improving yield under drought conditions stands as a major challenge for crop breeding. Based on previous work and rice genome data, it is now established that the most valuable tolerance genes are derived from traditional aus-type rice varieties. In modern varieties, many of these tolerance mechanisms have been lost since varieties were developed for high-input, irrigated genes are therefore also not systems and were usually not selected under stress. These Sancient ¸ T represented in current rice reference genomes which are derived from modern varieties. Identifying novel tolerance traits and the underlying high-value genes from aus-type varieties provides a uni (new) rice varieties for marginal, stress-prone que and important opportunity to develop Sfuture ¸ T environments and to improve stress tolerance of modern rice. Within the proposed project, we will therefore identify novel tolerance genes that are specifically expressed in roots of tolerant aus-type rice varieties when grown under drought stress and P-deficiency.
