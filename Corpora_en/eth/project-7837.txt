Wavefront Reversing Mirrors for LIDAR Applications Using Optical PhaseConjugation Lidar instruments have been extensively investigated for many remote sensing techniques. For most applications they require powerful, single frequency, frequency stable, and long pulse lasers in the eye safe spectral range. For coherent lidar instruments for atmospheric remote sensing evident candidates are diode pumped Tm,Ho:YAG solid-state lasers operating at eye-safe wavelength of 2.09 mm. The laser transmitter must have a powerful single transverse mode beam. Therefore high reflection phase conjugate mirrors based on nonlinear optical materials are a possible solution to overcome the problems of thermal lensing in the strongly pumped active laser medium. Phase aberration correction devices in the receiver optics can also play an important role in the coherent detection because they could help in improving the spatial overlap of the signal and the reference wave on a heterodyne detector. In order to correct for unwanted phase aberration we are currently investigating phase conjugate mirrors based on stimulated Brillouin scatering that work efficiently at 2\gmm and in a 100 - 500 nanosecond time interval. Our goal is to scale the phase conjugate mirror to energies beyond 1J. Our present source is a Q-switched, flashlamp pumped Cr,Tm,Ho:YAG laser which delivers 20 mJ pulses.
