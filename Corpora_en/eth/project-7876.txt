High-Repetition Mode-Locked Semiconductor Lasers Light sources with high repetition rates and short optical pulses are basic tools for telecommunication applications, for instance for driving all-optical switches. Semiconductor Lasers provide besides high modulation bandwidth and compactness, the ability for integration. An approach for producing short light pulses with a duration of some picoseconds is the technique of active mode-locking. We have realized active mode-locking of an InGaAsP/InP-ridge waveguide laser diode at a wavelength of 1.55 \gmm where mode-locking was achieved with external cavities as well as with integrated cavities. One- and twosegment laser diodes with a length of 250 and 500 \gmm were provided with an AR-coating on one facet when coupled to an external cavity with a reflecting grating for wavelength control. Cavity lengths of 30 and 6 cm were realized to produce optical short pulses at repetion rates of 500 MHz and 2.5 GHz, respectively. Short pulses with a duration of 10-15 ps have been produced with a peak power of some mW. Monolithic laser pulsers with a gain and modulation segment, integrated with a passive waveguide, were designed and fabricated. Laser diodes with a total length of 4.4 mm produced pulses of 20-30 ps at repetition rates of 10 GHz.
