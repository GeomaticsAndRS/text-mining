Representation of Space and Movement in the Brain Space and time are a priori forms of knowledge which should be hard-wired in the brain. Recent measurements of the neuronal firing patterns in the alert monkey have shown (in the vestibular, visual and auditory sensory systems, in the oculomotor and skeletomotor systems and in higher areas of sensori-motor integration) a multitude of different representations of space and movement, in coordinate systems which are appropriate for the tasks in their subsystems. Within the context of a major review article (Rev. Modern Physics) we are trying to understand geometrically and dynamically the transformations between these representations.
