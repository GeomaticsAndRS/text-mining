Development of a model-predictive, closed-loop controller for the MCSGP-process The MCSGP-process is a continuous chromatographic process for the pu- rification of therapeutic proteins and peptides. In order to ensure a stable operation over long time periods, relaible analytics and control concepts are needed. The chromatographic purification of therapeutic proteins and peptides is a challenging task and furthermore one of the most costly process steps. New process concepts of continuous chromatography are applicable to the purification of therapeutic proteins and help to significantly reduce the cost of the chromatographic purification. One of these process concepts is the MCSGP-process, which is a multi-column, counter-current gradient chromatographic process. In order to ensure long term and stable operation, tailored control concepts and analytics have to be employed. For the analytics, either online and at-line measurements have to be taken using suitable methods to be developed. for these analytical method, a trade-off between analysis time and accuracy has to be made, particularly considering the specific requirements of the controller. Regarding the controller, existing model-predictive controller concepts have to be tested and adjusted to the highly dynamic, hybrid MCSGP process. Special attention during the controller development has to be paid to the time and spatial resolution of the simulation, to the availability of the analytical results and to the response time of the controller loop.
