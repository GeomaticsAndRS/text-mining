High-Resolution Calorimetry at Low Temperatures We have developed a technique to detect a possible first-order transition at the irreversibility line in the magnetic phase diagram of copper-oxide superconductors. According to predictions made by theories describing vortex-lattice melting, the associated latent heat should be of the order L = 1 k$_Bper vortex per CuO$_{2}$(multiple-)layer. With our technique, which is based on the differential thermal-analysis method, we are able to resolve a hypothetical latent heat L = 0.02 k$_Bper vortex per layer in samples of milligram size, in external magnetic fields of H = 5 Tesla. In our experiments on YBa$_2$_3$_7$single crystals, we do not observe any latent heat at the irreversibility line within the accuracy of our measurement. It is not clear at present whether this is due to sample imperfections or due to the fact that in the case of YBa$_2$_3$_7$, such a feature is much smaller than previously expected or even unobservable in principle.
