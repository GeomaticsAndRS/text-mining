Brownian Motion in a Poissonian Potential The project aims at the mathematical study of the interaction of Brownian motion with certain soft Poissonian traps (Poissonian potential). This can be viewed as a model for a diffusing particle in a partially absorbing random medium, but is also closely related to models for intermittency effects (Gaertner-Molchanov, Zeldovitch et al.) or to certain polymer models in presence of columnar disorder (Krug-Halpin Healy). One general goal is to study the typical behavior of a diffusing particle which is not absorbed after a long time period. Large holes in the trap configurations play an important role. The model has a rich structure: distinct quenched and annealed behavior, existence of critical external drifts, confinement effect, pinning effect ...). Discrete versions of the problem are also studied (Antal, Khanin-Mazel-Shlosman-Sinai).
