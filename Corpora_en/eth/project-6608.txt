Unified Use of Heterogeneous Information Systems Many electronic information systems are publicly accessible (Internet, WWW), the number of individual information providers on such systems is growing fast, and so does the number of potential information users on all these personal computers (PC) in office and at home. This flexible and booming world contrasts strongly with existing important information services on large, mainframe type information servers; many potential users cannot access them since the user interfaces are incompatible and difficult to understand. This project investigates ways to improve PC user access to heterogeneous information systems by unified concepts and simple tools.
