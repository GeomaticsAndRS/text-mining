Monte Carlo Methods for the Simulation of Polymers The simulation of polymeric systems has been hampered by the extremely wide spectrum of relaxation times exhibited by polymers. In this project, new methods are being developed that seem to be able to sample the pertinent statistical-mechanical ensemble correctly and efficiently even at the high densities prevailing in polymer melts and glasses. In the course of the simulation, a stochastic path through configuration space is generated by means of algorithms that ensure proper sampling. These approaches make dramatic configurational changes possible, thus greatly enhancing configuration space sampling.
