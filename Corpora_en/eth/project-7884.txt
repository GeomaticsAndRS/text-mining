12 Channel Receiver Array for Parallel Optical Interconnects In telecommunications and computer systems high capacity interconnects will be used in the near future. Optical interconnects offer high bandwidth and electro-magnetic-immunity. Parallel optical links allow to use commercial available technologies for the driver and receiver circuits, thus reducing costs to a minimum without suffering any loss in transmission-capacity. The SPIBOC Project will develop a set of standardized and easy to use components for intra-rack, backplane and board level multi channel optical links, such as driver-, laser-, detector- and receiver-arrays, flex-foils, D-fibre backplanes, connectors and packages. ETH contributes with the development of detector arrays, optimized for l=1.3\gmm and receiver arrays, which amplify and reshape the incoming signal to a well defined digital signal. The receiver array is AC-coupled, taking a DC-balanced data stream from 0.6 to 2.5GBit/s per channel. This allows an aggregate capacity of 30GBit/s. A 12 channel receiver array has been developed. Major design challenges were suppressing crosstalk from one channel to others and designing for high rejection of supply noise. The receiver was fabricated on a standard 1\gmm silicon bipolar technology. Simulations and measurements correspond very well. The achieved channel sensitivity of the receiver module is -23dBm in the fibre at a bitrate of 2.5GBit/s. Crosstalk penalty when all 11 neighbouring channels are operated at +15 dB overdrive is as low as 1 dB. The ETH detector- and receiver arrays are part of the receiver modules built by Nortel, and are currently built into prototype advanced telecom- and computer equipment. This work has been supported by the Commission of the European Union under the ESPRIT III Project Standardized Packaging and Interconnection for Inter- and Intra- Board Optical Communication SPIBOC, and by the Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science, Berne.
