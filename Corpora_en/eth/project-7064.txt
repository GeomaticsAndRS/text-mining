Technology and Society: Communication of images of techniques from experts to the public:the case of biotechnology and genetic engeneering in Switzerland (research project genius ) Investigating the communication of images between scientific experts and laymen ("counter experts") in the field of biotechnology, the project deals with the translation of technology-intensive innovations from experts to the general public. Due to a national referendum to come on the issue of biotechnology these questions are of special importance for Switzerland. Basic research questions: Who are the experts and who are the communicators engaged in the translation process? What kind of images do scientific experts and laymen have about their communication on biotechnology and how do these images change as a result of the campaign scheduled for mid 1998? Are experts and laymen aware of these images and how far do they want to communicate them? How are the images of experts and laymen communicated by the media? Methods and data: 1) Expert interviews (two waves: first wave 6-8 months prior to the referendum, second wave 2-3 months before referendum); 2) media analysis (content analysis of print media and electronic media).
