Fabrication and Characterization of a Hybrid Thin Film PyroelectricDetector Based on KTa1-xNbxO3 In order to get the maximum performance from a pyroelectric detector, the detecting structure has to have a small thermal mass and should be well thermally insulated from the surroundings. We satisfied these requirements by building a KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$-based hybrid detector structure on a silicon wafer. The liquid phase epitaxy grown KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$thin films were polished, provided with evaporated Ta/Au contacts, and indium bonded with an oxidized silicon wafer. Subsequently, the KTaO$_{3}$substrate was mechanically removed, leaving only an approximately 20 \gmm thick KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$film. Using the silicon oxide layer as a mask, silicon was anisotropically etched from the back side in a KOH solution. This resulted in practically free-standing, 20 mm thick KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$membranes measuring up to 4x4 mm$^{2}$. The pyroelectric response was measured at different frequencies and temperatures by using a chopped HeNe laser beam and a lock-in amplifier. The frequency response showed a maximum at 230 Hz which makes this material a good candidate for applications in IR video arrays. Fabrication of linear and two-dimensional pyroelectric arrays will be attempted in the near future.
