A traversing probe for mapping the particulate and gaseous emissions at the aircraft engine exhaust plane The project aims at manufacturing a traversing probe and applying it to the aircraft engine exhaust measurement. The probe has the unique capability to traverse the vertical and horizontal direction of the engine exhaust plane, therefore allowing accurate characterization of spatial engine emission.
