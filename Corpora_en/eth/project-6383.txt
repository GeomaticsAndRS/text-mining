Regulation of Atrialnatriuretic Factor (ANF) in ARC in Culture The partial reexpression of a fetal gene program in ARC includes the reappearance of ANF in the ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro. This corresponds to the reported reexpression of ANF in the hypertrophied ventricular myocard in vivo. Newly isolated ventricular ARC, contrary to atrial ARC, do not contain immunoreactive ANF, as we could show by radioimmunoassay. After 10 days in culture, however, ventricular ARC contain ANF in granules as shown by immunofluorescence. The number of strongly ANF-positive cells definitely increases with time coincident with the reorganization of the myofibrillar apparatus. Thus we propose that this system may be similar to overload hypertrophy in vivo. With ventricular ARC in longterm culture we have a system in our hands where we can study the effect of single factors on up-and down-regulation of ANF expression as well as on ANF secretion directly on the level of cardiomyocytes.
