The AMS Experiment at the International Space Station Alpha On the future International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) exists the unique oportunity to run relatively large scale experiments for several years outside the atmosphere. The Alpha Magnet Spectrometer (AMS) is based on a cylindrical permanent magnet with a radius of 50cm and hight of 80cm with a field of approx. 0.15T. It is instrumented with a 6 layer silicon tracker, a scintillator time-of-flight hodoscope, an aerogel counter for particle identification and an anticoincidence system to reject background events. AMS is optimized to measure the amount of antimatter nuclei (Z>1) in cosmic rays in the momentum range 0.5 GeV to 300 GeV to a precision about 4 orders of magnitude better than todays limit. This will allow to discover or rule out distant regions of space populated by antimatter that are not excluded by most theories describing the evolution of the universe after the Big Bang. In addition it will measure the spectra of normal matter cosmic rays, positrons and antiprotons, allowing to investigate nature of dark matter and the evolution of the early universe. During space shuttle flight STS-91 (may 1998), AMS will be tested and take first data during approx. 100 hours at an altitude of about 430 km.
