Ion Microprobe by Capillary Focusing This project investigates the focusing of MeV ion beams by a capillary to a diameter less than a micrometer. The microbeam can be used for analysis and modification of materials. MeV ion microprobes conventionally work with magnetic lens systems that are expensive and require a large amount of space. There is evidence [1] that ion beams can also be focused by glass microcapillaries. It is assumed that this effect is due to surface channeling of the ions. Charging of the inner wall of the capillary might also contribute. In this project the underlying physical principles of capillary focussing are investigated and a microprobe using this mechanism is set up. The microbeam can be used for materials analysis and modification. It is planned to install a scanning transmission ion microscope and micro-PIXE. T. Nebiki, T. Yamamoto, T. Narusawa, M.B.H.
