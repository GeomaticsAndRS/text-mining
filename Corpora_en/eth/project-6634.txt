Combinatorics and Geometry: Algorithms, Systems, Applications Computer science and practice traditionally distinguish two modes of computing that use distinct techniques and apply to distinct types of applications: Combinatorial and numerical computing. Recently, however, computational geometry forced a detailed and difficult analysis of the interaction of both. We aim to understand how problems can be solved that exhibit combinatorial and geometric features in combination. Problems at the common frontier of graph theory and geometry are of that type. The applications that call for increased interaction between numerical and combinatorial computing include geographic information systems (discrete time-space-structures embedded in a map, e.g. a time table for a railroad network), and molecular modeling (determine the relative location of atoms in space). We investigate weighted graphs that can be embedded in space so as to preserve given distances, angles and other geometric constraints. Such problems arise in structural engineering (rigidity of structures) and in molecular modeling (the Distance Geometry approach). The concept of elastic embedding deals with data that is subject to errors.
