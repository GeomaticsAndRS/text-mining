Work of Francis Bacon (1561-1626) In 1994 I completed an edition of selected English works by Francis Bacon (1561-1626) for Oxford University Press ("The Oxford Authors" series). This work consisted in establishing the copy-text (in some cases from manuscript sources) of eighteen works by Bacon, covering his whole range of activities in literature, philosophy, law, and politics, and providing introductions and detailed annotation (identifying sources, providing translations, and explaining semantic and other difficulties). The finished volume consists of about 500 pages of text, 350 pages of commentary. Publication is expected in February 1996.
