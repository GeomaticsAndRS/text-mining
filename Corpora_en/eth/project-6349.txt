Occupational Health - Respiratory responses to affective visual and acoustic stimuli That respiration ist strongly related to our emotions is suggested by every day observations and speech. However, we are still lacking in basic knowledge concerning the types of respiratory patterns that may be observed under different emotional conditions. The usefullness of the dimensional model for analyzing emotional effects on respiration has been suggested earlier. The valence and arousal dimensions have been found to account for most of the variance in emotional judgments and recent work has provided evidence for correspondance between physiological variables and these emotional dimensions. However, very few studies have specifically investigated the relation between respiratory parameters and dimensions of valence and arousal. In two experiments, we investigate respiratory responses to affective pictures, music excerpts and everyday sounds. Goals of these studies are, first, to assess the covariation between dimensional judgments of affective valence and arousal and the respiratory response and, secondly, to determine if the main affective states experienced while looking at pictures or listening to acoustic stimuli can be differentiated by one or more respiratory indices. Moreover, we are interested in comparing the patterns of reactivity during visual and acoustic simulation. Similar response patterns would support the thesis that a common emotional system is activated, whereas finding different patterns would suggest modality-specific modulation.
