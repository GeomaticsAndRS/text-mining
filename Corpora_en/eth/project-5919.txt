OPTIQUE (Integrated Optical Sensors for Medical Analysis) The project is aimed at the realization of an integrated optical interferometer as well as the optically active sensing films to yield a compact, reliable and inexpensive sensor head intended for analysis of medically relevant substances. Our contribution covers the development and improvement of reversible optode membranes being compatible with the semiconductor integrated optical platform. For this purpose the optical transducer (a pH-sensitive dye) incorporated in the PVC membrane, has to be adapted to the working wavelength of the integrated light source at 800 nm. New lipophilic and photochemically stable pH-indicators with absorption maxima at near-infrared wavelengths are developed and their chemical and physical properties are modified and adapted to the required membrane environment. For planning of new dye structures a semi-empirical MO calculation program according to Pariser, Parr and Pople (PPP) is used to predict electronic transitions. Promising structures are synthesized in the laboratory and finally tested as optical transducers within the membranes. To overcome solubility and leaching problems, other types of polymers (Nafion, sulfonic acid polymers) with immobilized anionic sites are evaluated.
