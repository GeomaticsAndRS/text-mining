Evolution of the continental crust and mantle of the Alpine orogens This project, performed mainly in the Central and Western Alps, deals mainly with the geodynamic evolution of the continental crust and mantle since the Archean (> 2.5 Ga) until Alpine times (ca 65 - 20 Ma). The ages and origins of zircons (crust or mantle) are generally determined by ion microprobe
