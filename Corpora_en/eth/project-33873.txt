Intelligent scaffolds as a tool for advanced tissue regeneration The main aim of the proposed project is development of innovative biotechnology for formation of intelligent biomimetic scaffolds as advanced solutions for bone tissue engineering capable to provide high level of chemical stability, structural integrity and cytocompatibility. The main aim of the proposed project is development of innovative biotechnology for formation of intelligent biomimetic scaffolds as advanced solutions for bone tissue engineering capable to provide high level of chemical stability, structural integrity and cytocompatibility. For that purpose multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach will be applied to; (i) Reach significantly high level of the similarity of the scaffold with the native bone tissue by mimicking its compositional, structural, surface and mechanical properties; (ii) Rationalize bioactivity-biodegradation-mechanical strength relationship by the application of the interpenetrating polymer approach where mechanical strength of synthetic polymers will be combined with bioactivity and strength-supported role of natural polymers; (iii) Formulate the innovative layer-by-layer approach for assembly of the 3D scaffolds specially optimized to combine controlled micro-porosity, nanostructured topography, and specific surface functionalities within a single scaffold; and (iv) Incorporate the mechanism for guiding the regeneration process by two-directional interaction of the scaffold with surrounding cells in order to reach desired biological response.
