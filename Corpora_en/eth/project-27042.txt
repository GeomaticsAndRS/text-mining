Two-dimensional electron gas at perovskite interfaces The two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface between a LaAlO3 film and the SrTiO3 substrate is investigated by nonlinear optical spectroscopy, piezoforce microscopy and density functional theory The two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface between a LaAlO3 film and the SrTiO3 substrate is investigated by nonlinear optical spectroscopy, piezoforce microscopy and density functional theory. The electronic transitions involved in the emergence of the interfacial reorganization are investigated by nonlinear optics. Lateral spatial homogeneity is probed by nonlinear optical imaging and force microscopy. In addition the dynamical aspects of the interface state is probed in excitation experiments.
