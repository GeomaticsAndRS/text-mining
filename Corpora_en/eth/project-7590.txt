Solar Hydrogen by a 2-step H2O-splitting Thermochemical Cycle Two-step H2O-splitting thermochemical cycles for producing solar hydrogen are investigated using concentrated solar radiation as the energy source of high-temperature process heat. In an endothermic, solar step, ZnO is thermally reduced into Zn and O2. In an exothermic, non-solar step, Zn can either react with water to produce hydrogen or be used directly in a fuel cell or battery for generating electricity. In either case the resulting chemical product is ZnO, which is solar recycled. The net reaction is H2O=H2+0.5O2; H2 and O2 are derived in different steps, eliminating the need for high-temperature gas separation. This project aims at the design, construction, testing, and modeling of a high-temperature solar chemical reactor for the thermal production of Zn and of a hydrolysis reactor for the production of H2. Ongoing work encompasses the engineering development of a solar receiver-reactor, such as the one shown schematically in the figure below. Preliminary tests with a 10 kW prototype reactor were conducted at PSI's solar furnace with power fluxes of 4000 kW/m2. Temperatures exceeding 2200 K were attained at the ZnO surface. The reactor system proved to have extremely low thermal inertia and excellent resistance to thermal shocks. Further development work is focused on solar chemical reactor modeling using CFD and Monte Carlo ray-tracing techniques.
