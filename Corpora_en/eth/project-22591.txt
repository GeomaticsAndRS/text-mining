(In)Security: Knowing the international, ordering the domestic Knowledge of danger orders political processes in distinct ways, defining and projecting subjects and subject-positions. This project analyses how such ordering conditions foreign policy-making and domestic security politics. in practice, they Ideas of public, national or international danger do not merely describe reality U order reality in distinct ways, given that they define and project a variety of differential subjects and subject-positions. The securitization of migration or climate change, for examples, comes with larger spatial understandings of who (or what) threatens whom and how, and thus a distinct epistemological and practical ordering of international politics. In the same token, popular new danger coming with concepts such as risk or resilience are given distinct political meanings as well U implicit understandings of duties and responsibilities in the provision of security, they are used to arrange the political or-ganization of societies in distinct way. This research project analyses (and questions) the ways in which threat and danger concepts are used to order foreign affairs and domestic security politics, thus conditioning their policy enactment.
