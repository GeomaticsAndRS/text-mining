Production of sugar alcohols by epimerization-hydrogenation Sugar alcohols are widely used as low-caloric sweeteners and comprise high added-value compounds for the preparation of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Herein, we pursue an epimerization-hydrogenation approach to enable the use of cheaper and more available sugar substrates. Aiming at the preparation of rare sugar alcohols from broadly available aldose sugars, we have initially focused our efforts on the production of mannitol. This polyol could be obtained from mannose with full selectivity, but it is industrially prepared by hydrogenation of the cheaper fructose even if the latter leads to an equimolar mannitol-sorbitol mixture. Herein, we have attempted its production from glucose coupling an epimerization step to mannose over a novel supported heteropolyacid with the hydrogenation of the latter over a well-established Ru/C catalyst in one pot. Though the composition of the epimerization mixture is unfavorably richer in glucose, whose hydrogenation leads to sorbitol selectively, we discovered that the hydrogenation rate of mannose is up to three times faster than for glucose, thus leading to mannitol yields similar to those obtained starting from fructose. The system is being optimized coupling an in-depth characterization of the catalysts with catalytic evaluation under distinct temperatures and hydrogen pressures. Furthermore, we are unraveling the possibility to produce mannitol continuously using series reactors to conduct the two transformations under individually tailored conditions. Thereafter, we will explore whether the application scope of this catalytic technology can be broadened to comprise the preparation of other rare sugars (e.g. galactose, allose, lyxose, and ribose) and the corresponding alcohols starting from C6 and C5 aldoses (e.g. glucose and xylose).
