Production of sugar alcohols by epimerization-hydrogenation Sugar alcohols are widely used as low-caloric sweeteners and comprise high added-value compounds for the preparation of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Herein, we pursue an epimerization-hydrogenation approach to enable the use of cheaper and more available sugar substrates.
