Demographic and Genetic Processes Underlying Regeneration in Lodoicea maldivica, the Largest-Seeded Plant in the World We assess the demographic structure and the genetic diversity within and between populations of Coco de Mer to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of the species. The endangered Seychelles palm Lodoicea maldivica (coco de mer), is a truly remarkable species, producing the largest seeds in the plant kingdom. The nuts are the most valuable in the world. Most of these nuts are collected and sold to tourists, contributing substantially to the economy of the Seychelles. Despite its extraordinary ecological and economic significance, very little is known about the reproductive ecology and regeneration of the Coco de Mer. With virtually no seed dispersal (the seeds fall directly below the mother plant) it can be seen as an evolutionary endpoint in a spectrum of dispersal strategies among higher plants. This project applies molecular ecological methods and detailed field ecological surveys to investigate the role of dioecy, pollen dispersal and restricted seed dispersal in shaping the patterns of genetic diversity, demographic structure and fitness in this extraordinary species. The results of this study will contribute directly to the conservation and management of Coco de Mer, but will also have broader relevance to our understanding of the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation in plant species with limited seed dispersal.
