Potential for future hydropower plants in Switzerland: A systematical analysis in the periglacial environment (PHP) In Switzerland, the high alpine environment is still covered by 944 kms of ice. The expected glacier retreat in the coming decades due to atmospheric warming will offer new perspectives for the construction of alpine reservoirs and hydropower plants to harness the considerable energy potential of the periglacial catchments. However, the immediate proximity to the glacial high alpine environment of such infrastructures will pose challenges in terms of construction, operation and maintenance, since the temporal evolution of glaciers, runoff and sediment transport in the catchments, the resulting reservoir sedimentation and the protection against different natural hazards have to be considered. The goal of the proposed study is to systematically assess where the construction of new reservoirs and hydropower plants appears to be feasible in the periglacial environment, with a strong research focus on future runoff changes, retreat and abrasive capacity of glaciers, sediment production and transport, reservoir sedimentation and operation, and hydropower potential.
