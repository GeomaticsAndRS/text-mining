Ectopic expression of delta FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog B mediates transdifferentiation of adipose-like spheroids into osteo-like microtissues Differentiation and transdifferentiation strategies have a large role in the manipulation of cells in replacing dysfunctional cells and tissues. We developed adipose-like microtissues using gravity-enforced self-assembly of monodispersed human primary preadipocytes to determine their transdifferent.
