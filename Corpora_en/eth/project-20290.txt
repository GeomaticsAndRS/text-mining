ACQWA - Assessing Climatic change and impacts on the Quantity and quality of Water This project aims at assessing the impacts of a changing climate, focusing on the quantity and quality of water in mountain regions, where snow- and icemelt represent the largest streamflow component. Advanced modelling, accounting for societal impacts and feeback mechanisms are the major strenghts.
