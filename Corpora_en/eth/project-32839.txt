Ambiguity Resolution Using Multi-frequency Data from Multi-GNSS This project attempts to develop efficient phase ambiguity resolution algorithms base on multi-frequency data from multi-GNSS.Various combinations of observations, not only geometry-free but also geometry-based, is investigated. The algorithms are evaluated with real data and modified Bernese 5.2. With new emerged Galileo, BeiDou and QZSS as well as traditional GPS and GLONASS, there are at least 5 GNSS constellations available currently. Most of the constellations transmit or would transmit signals on three or more frequencies. Compared to dual- frequency, the multi-frequency (triple- or more) signals increased the number of available measurements for user and, more importantly, could form more combinations with good characters, which are helpful for data processing, particularly for the preprocess and ambiguity resolution of high precision carrier phase measurements. The research of this project focuses on improving the success rate and reliability of ambiguity resolution using triple- or more frequency code and phase signals from Galileo, BeiDou and modernized GPS, all GNSS with multi-frequency data. Best combinations of multi-frequency data for cycle slip detection and ambiguity resolution would be investigated respectively. Besides geometry-free methods, we would pay more attentions on geometry-based method to fully utilize all a prior information available. All the biases between frequencies and systems should be handled correctly. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we will collect lots of real multi-frequency multi-GNSS data from IGS MGEX campaign and our own experiment field at ETH in Switzerland and National Time Service Center (NTSC) in China. We would develop multi-frequency multi-GNSS software based on the sophisticated GNSS software Bernese 5.2 in this project.
