Detection of magnetically induced ferroelectricity in multiferroic TbMnO3 bulk crystals The magnetically induced ferroelectricity is investigated by nonlinear optical techniques in multiferroic TbMnO3 bulk crystals. The magnetically induced ferroelectricity is investigated by nonlinear optical techniques in multiferroic TbMnO3 bulk crystals. Nonlinear optics is used to characterize the excitation spectrum in the range of d-d transitions which will be followed by ultrafast magnetisation dynamics involving an optical-pump/x-ray-probe approach.
