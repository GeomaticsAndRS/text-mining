Social Standards and International Trade Law The conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the birth of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have given rise to a debate on the possibility of linking free trade to a social clause. While some claim this would ensure fair competition (as a counter-measure against alleged social dumping ), others see it as a disguised form of protecionism, denying particularly low-wage developing countries their comparative advantage. The project will focus on the question whether minimal social standards should and can be incorporated into the body of International Trade Law and what measures are necessary to ensure the observance of internationally recognized core labour standards.
