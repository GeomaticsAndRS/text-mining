Innovative Functional Materials and Associated Technologies For the Development of New and Improved Chemical Sensors (MICS) In 1977, the European Commission carried out an Eurobarometer survey specifically on consumer issues. A main consumersS concern was about the safety and quality of products addressed to human consumption. Taste and smell together with texture and aspect characterize the quality of these products. The goal of the project was to develop easy to use, rapid and reliable tools able to characterize the organoleptic quality of industrial products. The final deliverable of the European project (G5RD-CT-2000-00327) is a novel quality monitoring instrument for liquid and gaseous product samples incorporating two new sensor arrays, innovative signal processing and pattern recognition data treatment. The main task of CCS was devoted to the development, evaluation, calibration and characterization (ISFETs and ISEs), for SUmami taste [1,2], and for testing the of sensor arrays for Ssaltiness ¸ T ¸ T stability of orange flavour (aldehyde-selective sensor [3]). If such sensors are applied to tomato paste, to Ketchup and to tomato juice with no or minor dilution, the interpretation of the results is far from being trivial; the correlation of sensor results with those of reference procedures such as AAS and HPLC is not necessarily given since the quantity measured by sensors is the active molality of the free analyte. Nevertheless, this quantity is identical with the biologically active fraction of a compound, and the results may be directly introduced in pattern recognition programes without loss in quality. The precondition is a good stability and reproducibility of the sensor results. In contrast, traditional reference methods determine the total concentration of a compound. The evaluation, calibration and interpretation of sensor results is a strong competence at CCS [4].
