Direct Search for dark matter in the universe The ArDM (Argon Dark Matter) is a liquid argon detector to search for signals from WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), which are candidates for the Dark Matter in the universe. The detector is designed to observe the recoiling argon nucleus after a WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering process. The ArDM (Argon Dark Matter) is a particle physics experiment based on a ton scale liquid argon detector to search for signals from WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), which are candidates for the Dark Matter in the universe. The detector is designed to observe the recoiling argon nucleus after a WIMP-nucleus elastic scattering process. The recoiling nucleus is exciting and ionizing neighbouring atoms, converting part of its kinetic energy into scintillation photons and free electrons. Both signals, from the scintillation light and the ionization charge, are measured. The pulse shape of the scintillation light (relative intensity of the fast and slow component) together with the light/charge ratio yield a strong signature to distinguish heavily ionizing recoiling nuclei from electron recoils, i.e. gamma and beta background. The scintillation light is detected by photomultiplier tubes at the bottom of the detector, and the ionization charge is measured with a novel double phase Liquid Argon Large Electron Multiplier Time Projection Chamber (LAr LEM TPC). The ionization electrons are drifted in a uniform electric field to the liquid surface, extracted into the gas and multiplied in the LEM. The detector is being assembled at CERN, and is planned to be moved to the Canfranc underground laboratory (LSC) in the Spanish Pyrenees by the middle of 2011 (Exp-08-2010-ArDM).
