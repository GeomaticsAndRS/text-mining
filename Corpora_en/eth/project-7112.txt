Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) The GEBA is a project of the World Climate Programme-Water (WMO, UNESCO, ICSU) and is aimed at assimilating the instrumentally measured surface energy fluxes into a database. The quality of the energy flux data is rigorously controlled. In the GEBA are currently 250000 energy flux monthly means from 1600 locations over the world. The GEBA is the most important data source for the Reevaluation of the Global Energy Balance Project of this group. It is also used for the validation of climate models and satellite algorithms.
