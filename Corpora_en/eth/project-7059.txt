A Comparative Analysis of Women's Labor Market Transition in the United States andSwitzerland The USA and Switzerland are two highly industrialized countries, which differ strongly with regard to their social institutions and family structures. These structural and cultural differences could have important effects on the occupational possibilites of individual participants in the labor market. Within the framework of this project it is intended to answer the question of whether, or to what extent, the specific characteristics of women (particularly regarding education and fertility) have different effects on occupational status and occupational career in Switzerland and the USA. For example, is it the case that the early decisions regarding occupation in Switzerland have more distinct and greater long-term consequences than in the USA? Do family events (such as marriage, children) have a significantly greater importance for the occupational career in Switzerland than in the USA? After giving birth, do Swiss women tend to leave the labor market or to change to a more female-dominated occupation? The aim of this project is to gain insight into the interaction between influences on the macro-level and on the micro-level in the process of social stratification.
