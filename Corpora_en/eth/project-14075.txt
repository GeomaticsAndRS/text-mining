A Bottom-Up Approach to modelling energy demand: Case study of Household Energy Demand in India The project seeks to decompose growth in household energy demand in India over a period of 20 years based on population trends, growth in ownership of electrical and other energy use equipment, changes in energy consumption patterns, and changes in energy use intensity. This decomposition would then be used to assess future trends in energy demand which can then be compared with more sustainable energy demand growth scenarios.
