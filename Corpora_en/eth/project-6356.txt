Occupational Health - Organic Dust In a broad range of professions workers are exposed to organic dust containing Endotoxin, bacteria, as well as fungi and their spores often in combination with gases such as Ammonia or H2S. Effects on health parameters of single substances as well as mixtures are studied in laboratory settings. In field studies effects of different animal farming environments on exposure patterns as well as on health parameters are studied.
