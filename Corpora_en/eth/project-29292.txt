Physical experiments on drift wood retention at the mountain torrent Kl. Schliere, Alpnach, Switzerland Physical scale experiments are performed to retain drift wood under supercritical flow conditions to prevent log jams at several bridges further downstream. Different flood scenarios are tested with a physical scale model that has been built on a 1:30 scale.
