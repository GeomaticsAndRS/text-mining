SOLZINC - Solar Carbothermic Production of Zinc Solar thermochemistry has emerged as a multidisciplinary research activity aimed at developing the science and technology required to transform solar energy into storable and transportable chemical fuels (e.g. H2 and Zn). The adjacent diagram depicts two routes for accomplishing such thermochemical conversion, based on the thermal and carbothermal reduction of ZnO, and the subsequent hydrolysis of Zn to form high-purity H2. Objective - Development of the solar chemical reactor technology at a power level of 0.5 MW. Milestones - Select the reactor concept and carbon source by obtaining an experimental performance map for a 10 kW prototype using ETH's High-Flux Solar Simulator. Experimental results from this work will be used to validate a numerical model that predicts the reactor performance. Partners - PSI (CH), CNRS (F), Weizmann Institute (IL), ScanArc (S), Zoxy (D) Scientific and technological challenges 1) Determination of the kinetics of ZnO-reduction and ZnO-dissociation in the temperature range 1300-2300 K, using different carbon sources and stoichiometry. 2) Design of the solar chemical reactor for Zn production, and the hydrolysis reactor for H2 production. 3) Matching the rate of heat transfer to the rate of the chemical reaction - it requires modeling radiation heat transfer coupled to a two-phase chemical transformation. 4) Demonstration of the efficient operation of a novel 0.5 MW solar chemical reactor using Cassegrain optics for high-flux radiation.
