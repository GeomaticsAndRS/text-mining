Identification and functional characterization of injury-regulated genes We have identified a large number of genes that are regulated by injury to the skin. Some of these genes, which encode growth factors and their receptors as well as proteins involved in signal transduction and gene regulation, have been selected for functional characterization Wound healing disorders are a major health problem which demand the development of effective therapeutics. This, however, requires a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying healing. Within an EC-funded project (WOUND - a multi-organism functional genomics approach is to study signalling pathways in epithelial fusion/wound repair) we identify evolutionary conserved genes and major signaling pathways that orchestrate the healing process, and we use model systems to help define their function. Previous studies demonstrated a strong conservation of the genes involved in murine and human wound repair and epithelial movement and fusion in Drosophila and C. elegans. Therefore, we perform a multi-organism functional genomics approach to identify genes that are under- or over-expressed during wound healing or that are required during epithelial morphogenesis. Our first objective is to identify genes regulated in more than one system. The second objective is to analyze their expression in situations of impaired fusion/repair. The third objective is to use invertebrate models and monocultures and organotypic mammalian culture systems to examine the function of the most highly conserved genes. Finally, for a few selected genes, transgenic/knockout mouse studies and studies using skin-humanized mice shall be performed to identify their in vivo function in repair. The ultimate goal is to identify and explore some genes as targets for the development of innovative therapeutics.
