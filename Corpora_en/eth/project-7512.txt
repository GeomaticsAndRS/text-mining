Crust-Mantle Boundary, Alpine Region The crust-mantle boundary forms an important lithologic marker for geodynamic processes. Fossile crust-mantle boundary regions have been identified in the Alps. Their magmatic and metamorphic evolution and P-T trajectories are studied in several areas of the Central Alps and Liguria. These studies permit to get insight into processes of regional and of general importance as 1. the post-Variscan, pre-Oceanic and Oceanic magmatism 2. extensional and subduction metamorphism and accompanying structures 3. the exhumation of lower crustal granulites 4. the metamorphic events in the pre-Alpine crust-mantle section.
