Cryogenic single molecule spectroscopy in confined systems We perform experiments on single fluorescent molecules cooled to temperature of 1.4 Kelvin. The narrow spectral lines of single molecules in this system allow us to study a series of quantum optical phenomena as well as its interaction with phonons.
