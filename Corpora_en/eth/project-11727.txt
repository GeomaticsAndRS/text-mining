Molecular characterization, production and effects of new bifidobacterial bacteriocins on the human gut microbiota The biochemical, biological and molecular characteristics of bacteriocins produced by new bifidobacterial strains isolated from baby feces are studied. In a second stage, effects of these strains and their purified bacteriocins on the gut microbiota composition and activity will be researched.
