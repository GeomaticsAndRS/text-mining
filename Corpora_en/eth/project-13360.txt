Doppler Imaging of IM Pegasi in Support of the Gravity Probe B Mission Gravity Probe B is the relativity gyroscope experiment developed by NASA/Stanford to test unverified predictions of Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity: space curvature and frame dragging effect. Our participation in the mission is to provide the best knowledge on the guide star in the optical.
