Specific Heat of Cuprate Superconductors near Tc We are measuring the specific heat of cuprate superconductors in the vicinity of the critical temperature with a new differential method (DTA). This promising method will also be used in external magnetic fields. Preliminary measurements of the specific heat of a 15 mg YBa$_2$_3$_7$single crystal with this method show a distinctly sharper anomaly at the critical temperature than previously reported in the literature. We plan to measure the specific heat of this sample also in external magnetic fields and those of more anisotropic superconductors like Bi$_2$_2$_8$. The high transition temperatures and the small coherence lengths of these compounds lead to significant fluctuations of the order parameter, which also dominate the specific-heat data close to the critical temperature. The interpretation of these effects in magnetic fields in terms of critical fluctuations involving, e.g., the XY-model or by considering models that assume the occupation of only the lowest Landau level (LLL) will be considered in order to try to explain the experimental results. The main goal of these experiments is to be able to classify the phase transition of these cuprates into their superconducting state. Establishing the universality class and scaling behaviour of these phase transitions may contribute to solving basic questions related with the occurrence of superconductivity in these materials.
