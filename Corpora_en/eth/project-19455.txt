The Glioma Plasma Membrane Signal Transduction Network In this project we investigate the largely unknown plasma membrane signal transduction network of gliomas, the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Proteomic technologies are being developed and applied for the analysis of phosphorylated glioma plasma membrane glycoproteins as diagnostic marke
