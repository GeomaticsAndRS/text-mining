Accelerated Creep and Progressive Rock Slope Failure In this project we study the physical processes behind precursory signals of catastrophic rock slope failures in crystalline rocks. The most important precursory signal studied in this project is accelerated slip recorded over 10 years at high spatial resolution at the Preonzo (Switzerland) rockslid Large rock slope instabilities show precursory signals prior to catastrophic failure which remain difficult to fully understand from a rigorous physical perspective. The most important precursory signals are accelerated slip over timescales of weeks to years, which are used as indicators for progressive failure and time-to-failure estimations, critical for rockslide early warning and hazard mitigation programs. Most fundamental studies of the underlying mechanisms are small scale creep or stress relaxation experiments (e.g. Hao et al. 20
