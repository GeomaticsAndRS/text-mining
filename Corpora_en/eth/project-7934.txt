Low-Temperature Physical Properties of divalent Hexaborides Hexaborides as binary compounds may be synthesized with either divalent or trivalent cations. A particular case is SmB$_{6}$where an intermediate valence of the cations leads to ambivalent features, namely metallic behaviour at high temperatures and qualitatively semiconducting behaviour at low temperatures. In order to obtain a better judgement of the various puzzling phenomena, we set out to study in detail the properties of divalent hexaborides down to very low temperatures, an attempt that seemingly has not been made before. After a first investigation of SrB$_{6}$, we conclude that the electronic properties of this material, which is expected to be a semiconductor, are not quite as trivial as might be anticipated. Particularly intriguing is the loss of electrical resistivity of about 25% below 0.5 K, suggesting a phase transition of, so far, unknown origin. At present we are studying the low temperature features of EuB$_{6}$where the Eu-ions are all divalent. This compound orders magnetically and displays an unusually large magnetoresistance. All these studies, invoking measurements of thermal- and transport properties, are complemented by optical experiments.
