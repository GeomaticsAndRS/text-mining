InP HEMTs with Dry Etched Gate Recess A CH$_{4}$/H$_{2}$Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) process has been developed for gate recess etching of InGaAs/InAlAs/InP HEMTs. A high selectivity of 130 between the etch rates of InGaAs and InAlAs has been achieved. Dry etched HEMT devices show electrical parameters comparable to those obtained by wet etching, but with a much higher uniformity. The standard deviation of 22 dry etched HEMTs was 5% for the peak transconductance, 40 mV for the threshold voltage and 4% for the drain current. The corresponding standard deviations for wet etched devices varied between 8% and 18% for the peak transconductance and the drain current and 100-350 mV for the threshold voltage. Microwave measurements showed similar behaviour for both wet and dry etched devices. A transition frequency of 170 GHz was obtained for a HEMT with 150 \gmm gate width. Single stage amplifiers using dry-etched InP HEMTs showed a gain of 12dB at 61 GHz with a third-order intercept at 19.5 dBm output power.
