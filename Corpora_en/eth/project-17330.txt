Electro-optical Microring Resonators for Photonic Applications In this project we will develop electro-optically tunable microring resonators based on single-crystalline ferroelectric thin films, which will serve as building blocks for various optical processing functions, such as add/drop multiplexers and tunable filters for telecommunication applications.
