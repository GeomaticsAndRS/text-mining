Powder Metallurgy of High Performance Iron Alloys New methods are developed to produce iron base alloys with outstanding combination of corrosion resistance, strength and toughness. These new methods include the preparation of metal powder and the subsequent nitriding and compaction by hot isostatic pressing. Corrosion resistant tool steels, and metal matrix composites containing nitrides are among the products developed.
