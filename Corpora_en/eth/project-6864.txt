Synthesis and Characterisation of Cellulose Analogues We are designing and synthesising analogues of Cellulose I and II, to study the contribution of (specific) hydrogen bonds to their properties. In a first series of analogues, we have substituted the interglycosidic oxygen by a butadynediyl group, so as to interrupt interresidue intrastrand (but not interstrand) H-bonds. Studies of the spectroscopic and physicochemical properties of oligomers (up to 16-mers) evidence the importance of cooperative H-bonds form the association of cellulose chains. In a second series of analogues, we have attached one or two cellodextrin chains (up to octamers) to a template, ensuring a parallel orientation of the cellodextrin chains. Solid state MAS-$^{13}-spectra demonstrated that these analogues possess the structure of Cellulose II. In a third series of analogues, we again attach cellodextrin chains to a template, this time also mimicking the phase shift between two independent cellulose chain of crystalline Cellulose I; we are asking if a correct orientation of two independent cellodextrin chains will lead to (relatively) small mimics of crystalline Cellulose I. The synthesis of the acetyleno-analogues has led to improved or new synthesis of C-alkynyl-glycosides, methods for the oxidative directed cross-coupling of alkynes and to orthogonal protecting groups for dialkynes. Studies of the template-attached cellodextrins have led to an in depth examination of intra- and intermolecular H-bonds of saccharides in DMSO, resulting in a set of rules for the assignment and interpretation of hydroxyl group signals.
