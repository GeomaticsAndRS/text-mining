Highly magnetic nanocomposite actuator Today every industrially applied movement is based on rigid axis or rotators. With a soft, flexible and mechanically stable polymer which can be controlled by a magnetic field a new movement can be designed. Magnetic hydrogels have the potential to act as soft actuators (soft pumps, art. muscles).
