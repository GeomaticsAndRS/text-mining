Macroeconomic Environment and Income Diversification in West African RuralAreas. The Case of Mali. It is now widely recognised that price incentives may not be sufficient to enable farmers to increase their agricultural production and though reduce poverty in rural areas. Economical measures such as structural adjustment are to be accompagned by other instruments. This study first asses income diversification strategies in a given rural area using household level surveys. The data as well as surveys on the meso-level are used to assess socio-economical constraints faced by rural households. Finally the empirical material should help designing projects at regional and/or at more local level. This is to enhance integration of the rural, and especially the poor, households into the changing macro-economical environment given by the structural adjustment program, and integrate them into a more sustainable growth and development process. The macro-meso-micro approach will be applied with the focus on meso-micro levels. Econometric models will be used.
