Supercomputer in the Pocket: Integrated Development of a High Performance Computing Platform for Embedded Systems Goal is the development of a massively parallel hardware / software architecture for embedded systems. The system will rely on a large number of extremely simple interconnected CPUs on an FPGA. A mobile high-performance health monitoring application will serve as a proof of concept. on http://www.nativesystems.inf.ethz.ch/Main/WebHomeResearchProjectsIces
