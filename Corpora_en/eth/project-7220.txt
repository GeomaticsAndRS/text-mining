CMOS Based High Speed Video High-speed imaging (500 - 1000 frames/sec) of human motions with high spatial resolution is primarily needed in trauma biomechanics for the analysis of injury mechanisms. Furthermore, in sports biomechanics or orthopedics high-speed video is of use for motion analysis. With the advent of CMOS image sensors with high resolution (more than 1000x1000 pixels) which allow a rapid data transfer, low-cost high speed video has become feasible. In this project, a hand-held high-speed video camera (500 - 1000 frames/sec) with a resolution of more than 1000x1000 pixels is being developed which can be used under crash conditions (up to 50g acceleration levels). Sequences of up to 1.5 sec are stored in the camera. Transfer to a laptop is made offline after the event.
