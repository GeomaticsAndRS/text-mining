Dendronized polymers Synthesis of dendronized polymers with varying cross-sectional diameters to explore whether there are thickness effects in polymer chemistry. These polymers are investigated in regard to persistence lengths, single-chain elastic moduli, self-assembly behavior in the charged state, and their ability to fold back on themselves. Some representatives are of interest in regard to their thermoresponsive behavior, others will be explored for their loading capacity in terms of attaching the load (drugs, dyes, etc.) covalently to the infinite number of ends or in terms of nestling the load into the branch work by typical host/guest effects.
