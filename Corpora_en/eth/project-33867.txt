Synthesis of (new) oxide materials and study of their physical and structural properties: Searching for new multiferroics and superconductors A new laboratory for the synthesis of special oxides was established in the period from 2011 to 2013. The materials which are considered, synthesized and studied are especially oxides of the type AnBnO3n+2 and hexagonal layered YMnO3 type compounds.
