Mild stochastic calculus and weak convergence rates for stochastic partial differential equations http://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/sam_projects/jentzen/numerical.php Strong convergence rates for (temporal, spatial, and noise) numerical approximations of semilinear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with smooth and regular nonlinearities are well understood in the scientific literature. Weak convergence rates for numerical approximations of such SPDEs have been investigated since about 11 years and are far away from being well understood: roughly speaking, no essentially sharp weak convergence rates are known for parabolic SPDEs with nonlinear diffusion coefficient functions; see Remark 2.3 in [A. Debussche, Weak approximation of stochastic partial differential equations: the nonlinear case, Math. Comp. 80 (2011), no. 273, 89-117] for details. One key goal of this project is to solve the problem emerged from Debussche's paper and to establish weak convergence rates for SPDEs with nonlinear diffusion coefficient functions. We intend to solve this problem by using a new - somehow mild Ito type formula (see Da Prato et al. 2012). A further goal of this project is to use this mild Ito type formula to reveal and investigate regularity properties of solutions of such SPDEs.
