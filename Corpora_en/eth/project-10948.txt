Design and protein engineering of Pyruvate Oxidase from Lactobacillus plantarum for application in biosensors This project addresses the main drawback of many enzymes that could be used in analytical instruments namely their fast degradation. It is the aim of the project to stabilize this Pyruvate Oxydase in order to get a pyruvate and phosphate sensor with a lifetime of at least 2 weeks.
