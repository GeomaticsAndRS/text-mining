Band Structure in Strained Quantum Wells The use of heterostructures to cause quantum confinement is a way to modify the bandstructure of a material. Another possibility is the use of strained epitaxy, in which the lattice constant of the overlayer differs from that of the substrate. This has important effects on the bandstructure and therefore on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of the material. It is useful to know the band structure in such strained quantum well, so that one can determine the parameters of the selective array epitaxy. The program written to compute the valence band structure in quantum wells has been extended to include strain effects, assuming a (001) growth. To do so, a strain Hamilton matrix has to be added to the Hamilton of the unstrained case, yielding the strained Luttinger Hamiltonian çtH$_{tot}$=H+H$_{strain}$\tc where H$_{strain}$is a diagonal matrix. The results correspond very well to calculations done in another publicated theoretical work. (For example W.W. Chow, S.W. Koch and M. Sargent III, Semiconductor-Laser Physics .
