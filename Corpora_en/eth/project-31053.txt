Catalytic and enantioselective amide formation Amide-bond formation is perhaps the most widely used organic reaction. Despite of this, there are very few catalytic methods, and the state of the art remains an expensive and wasteful process. We are developing new methods fthat address challenges including catalytic, enantioselective amidation.
