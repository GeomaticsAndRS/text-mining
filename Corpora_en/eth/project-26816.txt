Design an optimization of fineblanking processes by means of ALE (Arbitrary Langrangian-Eulerian) Finite Element Method Failure criteria, which are able to predict the quality of fineblanking processes, will be developed and the corresponding model parameters will be determined experimentally. On the basis of these new criteria and the ALE Finite Element Method, industrial fineblanking parts will be optimized. Within the project Design an optimization of fineblanking processes by means of ALE (Arbitrary Langrangian-Eulerian) Finite Element Method failure criteria for the prediction of the fineblanking quality will be improved. Material parameters for the model will be acquired by experimental tensile and dilatometer tests as well as by a specially developed fineblanking tool. After verifying the model for different steels, simulations will be done in order to optimize and redesign fineblanking parts under industrial conditions and in collaboration with industrial partners.
