Dependence modelling in finance and insurance This project is about the modelling of dependence beyond linear correlation in insurance and finance. Special emphasis is given to applications in quantitative risk management (including Basel II and Solvency 2). Linear correlation only yields a rather restricted view on dependence. Especially in applications to quantitative risk management, one can use the method of copula modelling to go beyond the correlation approach. Is this long-term project we consider various approaches ranging from econometric time series modelling to rsik aggregation and allocation problems in financial risk management.
