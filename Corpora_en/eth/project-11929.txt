Regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses by oxidized phospholipids We have studied modulation of antigen presenting cell function and T helper cell development by oxidized phospholipids. Oxidized forms of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine promoted Th2 cell development. This Th2 skew was due to inhibition of IL-12 production and upregulation of IL-10
