Lead Tungstenate Crystal RD The Large Hadron Collider will be the next accelerator to be built at CERN in Geneva. As a primary objective, it should help unraveling the mystery of the origin of mass through particle physics experiments is one of the primary physics goals at LHC. Theories like the Standard Model predict that a yet unseen particle, called Higgs, is responsible for that. The CMS detector at the LHC is being designed to allow a search for the Higgs particle over its entire possible mass range. If it is light , with a mass around 100 GeV, it can be observed through its decay into two photon. This requires an excellent electromagnetic calorimeter, for which we plan to use Lead Tungstenate crystals. The quality and production technique of these crystals is being optimized in a joint effort between ETH, the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics and the Beijing Glass Research Institute in China. The goals are to understand the Lead Tungstenate scintillation production mechanisms and to enhance the light output; to produce radiation hard crystals; to understand its mechanical properties and to produce stress-free crystal which can be easily machined, and to find an economical way to produce them.
