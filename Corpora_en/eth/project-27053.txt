Use of scavengers in the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for improved chemicals production Woody biomass represents an interesting and abundant organic raw material for the production of chemicals. Based on a special pretreatment, the goal of this project is the simultaneous production of biofuels from cellulose and aromatic chemicals form the lignin fraction of wood.
