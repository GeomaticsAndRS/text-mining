Thermal creep effects on stability of steel columns in fire The results of the former research project show the distinctive influence of thermal creep on the cross-sectional capacity and slender column and beam-column strength in fire. The project aims at analyzing the influence of thermal creep on the stability behavior of steel beam-columns in fire.
