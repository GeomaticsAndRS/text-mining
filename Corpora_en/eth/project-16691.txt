Nanostructured materials from nanoparticles The project investigates the use of nanoparticles as a source for the fabrication of nanocomposites with a focus on fuel cells, filtration and functional polymers. The project investigates the use of nanoparticles as a source for the fabrication of nanocomposites with a focus on fuel cells, filtration and functional polymers. Nanoparticle research at the ETH Zürich has recently resulted in a process for the continuous manufacturing of salt and noble-metal nanoparticles. The development has resulted in a good understanding of possible use and application of functional particles. While the manufacturing of particles and their use constitute two different areas of research, it is a logical extension of the current field of research (manufacturing) to product development. Few such projects have been undertaken currently. For instance the use of calcium carbonate and silver nanoparticles allowed the fabrication of nanoporous silver membranes which are now investigated for their use as a catalytic electrode membrane in fuel cells or in nanofiltration. The present project links a market related need for new, functional products with an emerging technology at ETH.
