Topics in Condensed Matter Physics: Properties of Compressible andIncompressible Quantum Hall Fluids The fractional quantum Hall effect is one of the most remarkable effects in condensed matter physics. It is observed in two-dimensional electron gases in a strong, uniform, external magnetic field. When the longitudinal resistance of such a gas vanishes one speaks of an incompressible quantum Hall fluid; otherwise it is called a compressible quantum Hall fluid. The Hall conductance of an incompressible quantum Hall fluid has been shown to be a rational multiple of e$^{2}$/h. During the past several years, we have developed a remarkable and rather complete classification of incompressible quantum Hall fluids. In the future, we plan to explore the microscopic quantum theory of quantum Hall fluids and of their chiral edge currents in more detail, and we plan to study tunnelling from reservoirs into edge channels, attempting to interpret recent experimental data.
