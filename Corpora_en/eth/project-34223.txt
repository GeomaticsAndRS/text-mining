Redox-induced speciation changes and reductive mobilization of arsenic and iron in highly-contaminated river floodplains Arsenic is a highly toxic trace element which is enriched in many river floodplains due to past or current mining activities. The biogeochemical processes controlling As mobility and bioavailability in the soil are not fully understood, especially the coupling to microbial reduction of Fe and Mn.
