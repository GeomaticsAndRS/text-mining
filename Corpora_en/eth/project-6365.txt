Occupational Health - Influence of induced moods on the use of a computer system and the physiological correlates At present, computer systems interact with users in ways that do not allow for the complexities of naturalistic social interaction. Yet recent evidence demonstrates that humans have an inherent tendency to respond to media in ways that are natural and social, mirroring ways humans respond to one another in social situations. A computer that could recognize emotional information expressed by the user and produce affective responses would appear significantly improved in its interactive capabilities. What clues about a user's affective state could one give to a computer? Facial expressions, gestures, and voice are indices of affective states. Processing physiological signals offers yet another avenue to communicating affective state to a computer. Induced moods have been shown to affect the psychomotor behavior. For instance, psychomotor retardation has been associated with sadness. Thus, behavioral variables related to the use of a computer system, such as mouse-clicking, may be another variable that gives clues to a user's affective states, as some initial investigations suggest. In this study we investigate the effects of five different mood states (defined by the dimensions of valence and arousal; positive valence and high arousal, positive valence and low arousal, negative valence and high arousal, negative valence and low arousal, neutral valence and moderate arousal) induced by means of film clips on the use of the mouse and keyboard while performing a computer task. A number of indicators of the use of the computer system are determined and several physiological parameters are registered during the entire experiment (breathing parameters, heart rate, skin conductance, facial muscle activity). Subjective affective reports are assessed as manipulation check.
