Digital Geometry Processing of Scanned 3D Data This project explores digital geometry processing techniques for scanned 3D data, in the spirit of traditional signal processing but applied to irregularly sampled geometric data. We seek robust and efficient methods for filtering, parametrization, remeshing and other geometry processing operations. Digital 3D models, especially those acquired from real-world objects by scanning technologies, go through a digital geometry processing pipeline to prepare them for end applications. Processing operations include denoising and smoothing, resampling and mesh optimization, registration, parameterization, compression and more. We employ principles from discrete differential geometry, variational optimization and differential shape representations for a wide variety of geometry processing tasks. Our goal is to develop theoretical shape understanding and efficient and robust practical algorithms for delivering high-quality geometric data.
