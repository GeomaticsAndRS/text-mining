Synthesis and Characterization of HgBa2 Can-1 Cun O2n+2+ The mercury containing cuprates HgBa$_2$_{n-1}$_n$_{2n+2+\gd}$are of particular interest because of their high critical temperatures for superconductivity and the large positive pressure dependence \prT$_c$/\prp of the compound with n = 3. In this project the influence of varying various parameters in the synthesis at ambient pressure on the quality of bulk HgBa$_2$_{n-1}$_n$_{2n+2+\gd}$is investigated. The preparation and composition of the precursor materials which do not contain Hg because of its volatility, and the sintering process in the quartz ampoules, which are used for preventing the loss of Hg, can be varied. With subsequent annealing in different gas atmospheres the oxygen content in the HgO$_{\gd}$-planes may be changed. The samples are first characterized by X-ray diffraction for detecting the different parasitic phases, which are accumulated during the synthesis. Further investigations include magnetization measurements for the determination of the magnetically screened volume fraction and the critical temperature T$_c$. Scanning electron microscopy is used for analyzing some of the foreign phases in the samples. Heat capacity, resistivity and other physical properties will be measured on selected samples. The influence of various substitutions for HgBa, Ca and Cu on the physical properties and on the stabilization of the desired phase will also be studied.
