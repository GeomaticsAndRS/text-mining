From the Dawn of the Universe to Today: The Co-evolution of Galaxies and Black Holes This project aims to understand and quantify the role that the energy liberated by the growth of supermassive black hole has on the formation and evolution of galaxies. The project will make use of multiwavelength astronomical data from a variety of observatories on the ground and in space. This proposal aims to observationally explore the role of black hole growth phases in the formation and evolution of galaxies. Simulations of galaxy formation require a significant source of energy to produce realistic galaxies. Accreting black holes are the best candidate source for this energy as they can shine as the brightest objects in the Universe. The energy liberated by black holes in such quasar phases is sufficient to heat and expel gas in galaxies that would otherwise turn into stars and therefore force both the black hole and the galaxy to quiescence, but the empirical evidence remains thin. I will develop a full picture of this `feedbackS process using observations from ground and space telescopes.
