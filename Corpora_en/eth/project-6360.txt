Man Machine Interaction - Interface Design / Educational Software: KnowledgeMaps The use of electronic technologies and multimedia increasingly influence the production and use of learning materials. One major concern in computer-mediated learning is Information and Knowledge Representation (IKR). The aim of this project is to develop a universal IKR tool for digital documents. Focused on educational practice, the project will employ digital media and preserve the benefits of printed educational material. These aims shall result in - A modelling interface, which allows teachers to create and edit information structures out of modular parts -Learning Objects (LOs) - into compound information objects. - A context overview, relating to information, embeds a document into a global structure of educational documents. - A content overview, relating to information, gives detailed perspectives at the microstructure of a document. - A flexible structure, relating to information, gives users (normally teachers) multiple perspectives to the macro structure of a document. This is achieved by document configuration according to individual needs, e.g.: i) modifying focus and emphasis, and ii) re-arranging, re-ordering, and re-grouping chapters and sections. - A individual record, relating to knowledge, enables users (normally students) to keep exact record of where they are and have been in a document. It also enables its users to organise a highly graphical map according to their personal profile, representing their state of proficiency, work in progress, and topics to be repeated. The document portal, which gives users (teachers and students) easy access to all parts and sub-parts of a document. It employs best-practice orientation tools in a unique combination with electronic learning material.
