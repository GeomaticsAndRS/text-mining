Why do bacteria have sex? Theoretical and experimental investigations into the evolution of bacterial transformation Sex and recombination are ubiquitous not only in multicellular organisms, but also in bacteria. Using both mathematical models and experimental approaches, we will investigate the selective forces that have led to the evolution of bacterial transformation.
