B-Fabric: A Data Integration Platform for Management and Analysis of Heterogeneous Functional Genomics Data B-Fabric allows to store and access experimental data generated at FGCZ together with all information that is needed to find and correctly interprete the data. B-Fabric functions as the glue between the different all instrument PCs and analysis tools at FCGZ, guiding the instrument specialists and scientists through their scientific workflows. Users interact with B-Fabric through a simple Web portal. They benefit from B-Fabric in several ways. For instance, their data is transparently stored in a secure repository that is access controlled and continuously backed up. Moreover, users may run queries against all public B-Fabric data (about projects, experiments, samples, extracts etc.). In this way, integrated, inter-experiment analysis becomes a reality.
