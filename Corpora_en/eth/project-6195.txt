Computer-based Tools for Teaching Structural Analysis EasyStatics is part of the project Interstructures funded by the ETH-Board (Swiss Virtual Campus) and the rectorate of the ETH. The objective of Interstructures is to create interactive teaching modules for the basic courses in structural analysis to be used by students in civil engineering and architecture. The IBK develops a program based on the finite element method which allows the elastic and dynamic analysis considering the theory of 1st and 2nd order as well as the ultimate load analysis of plane trusses and frames. Full interaction through a sophisticated graphical user interface is very important for our purposes. The needs in the field of civil engineering are unfortunately are still often disjointed from the student's education. They still study the old computational methods and hardly develop their intuition about structural behaviour. The purpose of EasyStatics is to provide a virtual laboratory of structural analysis so that the student can develop his intuition on structural behaviour and be better prepared for practice.
