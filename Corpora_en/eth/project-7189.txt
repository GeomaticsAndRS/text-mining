150 Years of Railway - 150 Years of a New Switzerland The inaugural journey of the Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn (the first tracks railways ever to run in Switzerland, nicknamed because it was used - among other purposes - for the transportation of a popular type of pastry named Spanisch Brötli , from Baden where it was baked, to customers in Zurich) from Baden to Zurich on the 9th August 1847 formed not only the initial chapter in the story of Swiss railways, but also became a milestone in the history of environmental concerns of Switzerland. The Limmat Valley, lying between Baden and Zurich, which prior to 1850 was an unspoilt river valley, is today a highly industrialised landscape. Over many decades, the railway proved to be the major force behind this development. At present, a synopsis of the spacial-temporal changes in the Limmat Valley does not exist. The changes to the landscape should, therefore, be investigated and illustrated as an example and, as a service product, the findings made public.
