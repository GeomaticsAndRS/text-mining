Tragverhalten von gestossenen Biegeträgern aus Verbundsicherheitsglas / Load bearing behavior of sliced structural glass beams Sliced structural glass beams do not have a constant cross section over their length. Consequentially, stress concentrations occur in the region of joints. The main aim of this project is to develop a model to estimate the maximal principal stress that occurs in the beam. An innovative new application of laminated safety glass is in the manufacture of spliced structural glass beams. These beams do not have a constant cross section over their length. Due to these geometric singularities the stress distribution within the beam is not trivial. Consequentially, stress concentrations occur in the region of joints. These stress concentrations are the point of matter regarding the bearing capacity due to the brittle rupture failure mode of glass. The overall goal of this project is to get a better understanding of the load path in the entire beam and the stress distribution near joints. The findings will be used to develop an engineering model which allows the calculation of the maximal principal tensile stress in spliced structural glass beams as well as a model to estimate the overall stiffness of such beams. To achieve these objectives a combination of analytical and numerical methods, as well as laboratory tests are planned.
