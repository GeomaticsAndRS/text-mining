Exploring enzyme catalysis in pure organic solvent Enzyme catalysis in pure organic solvent is investigated. This includes the use of Ion-paired HRP in isooctane for the polymerization of phenol, and the use of lyophilized cell powder in organic solvent for enantioselective oxidations and reductions
