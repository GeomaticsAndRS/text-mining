Physics with positrons and study of positronium Apart from direct searches of unknown elementary particle physics through high energy accelerators, new unexpected results might also be expected from precision measurements at low energies. The fundamental aspects of low energy positron physics is related mainly to the precise experimental tests of the well-known theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is a quantum field theory of the interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic fields. QED is known to be a low energy remnant of the Standard Model of elementary particles. The present ability to calculate QED observables with extremely high accuracy is crucial for the experimental testing of many of the key aspects of the theory such as renormalization, perturbation expansions and bound-state formalism. Our goal is to develop our expertise in the field of positron physics. The understanding of the long-standing 5 standard deviations discrepancy between the measured and predicted decay rate of orthopositronium (o-Ps) in vacuum is the experimental achievement that we pursue. Such an experiment requires a tagged slow positron beam, an experimental aspect that we are currently investigating. In addition, we plan to search for the decay of the o-Ps state into a single photon. This decay is prohibited in QED, but if it occurs, could explain the observed decay rate discrepancy.
