Using a Geochemical Approach to Study Specific Biochemical Problems Associated with Microbial Dolomite Precipitation With the discovery of microbes that mediate dolomite formation, it is possible to conduct culture experiments in which dolomite is precipitated under earth surface conditions. This project uses this unique geomicrobiological tool to investigate long-standing geochemical questions involving dolomite. Summary The discovery of modern dolomite, forming under anaerobic conditions in hypersaline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, added a microbial factor, in addition to the kinetic and hydrologic factors, to the list of essential requirements for dolomite formation. From these promising results, we formulated the Microbial Dolomite Model, wherein sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediate the precipitation of dolomite (Vasconcelos et al., 1995; Vasconcelos and McKenzie, 1997a). Using a three-pronged research approach combining laboratory culture experiments with field studies in modern environments and comparative analysis of ancient analogues, we have now tested the Microbial Dolomite Model and can succinctly demonstrate the important role played by SRB in the low-temperature precipitation of dolomite. These results (Warthmann et al., 2000; van Lith, 2001; van Lith et al., 2002, 2003a,b), provide us a realistic method to achieve solutions to the long-standing Dolomite Problem. With the discovery of anaerobic microbes that mediate dolomite formation, we can now conduct controlled culture experiments in which dolomite is precipitated under Earth surface conditions. Recently, we have discovered hypersaline-tolerant aerobic microbes that also apparently mediate dolomite precipitation. Thus, we are now able to investigate specific long-standing geochemical questions surrounding dolomite formation under both oxic and anoxic conditions through the application of this unique geomicrobiological tool to study different aspects of dolomite formation.
