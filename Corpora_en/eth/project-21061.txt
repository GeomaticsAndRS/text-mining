Fracture and Rock Mass Properties of the Opalinus Clay (RC-Experiment Mont Terri) Subsequently to the study of the impacts of mechanical heterogeneities on the fracture generation in the EDZ of the Opalinus Clay (Yong 2007), this new mine-by experiment at the Mont Terri Lab focusses on a detailed understand of the impacts and properties of tectonic fractures in the Opalinus Clay.
