Fracture and Rock Mass Properties of the Opalinus Clay (RC-Experiment Mont Terri) Subsequently to the study of the impacts of mechanical heterogeneities on the fracture generation in the EDZ of the Opalinus Clay (Yong 2007), this new mine-by experiment at the Mont Terri Lab focusses on a detailed understand of the impacts and properties of tectonic fractures in the Opalinus Clay. The experiment aims to provide our understanding of the influence of pre-existing discontinuities and their characteristics on the behaviour of Opalinus clay. To capture the rock mass behaviour continuously, a high resolution automated 3D-monitoring system (Institut für Geodäsie & Photogrammetrie IGP ), a chain-deflectometer and Mag-X-extensometer were installed before the excavation of the experiment drift in the Mont Terri Underground Rock Laboratory. During the excavation 5-point monitoring arrays were installed after each round, laser scanning (IGP) were performed and a detailed mapping of fractures were conducted. After the excavation of the experiment drift the EDZ around the underground opening was investigated with refraction tomography. The field investigations are complemented with a comprehensive laboratory testing program conducted at Graz University on intact rock samples and at ETH Zurich (IGT-Laboratory) on preexisting fractures.
