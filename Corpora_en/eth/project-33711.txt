Magnetic force microscopy on skyrmion materials We investigate the formation of topoligically protected magnetic whirls, so-called skyrmions, in chiral magnets in spatially resolved magnetic force microscopy measurements. We investigate how magnetic whirls, so-called skyrmion, and helical magnetic structures emerge and transform in chiral magnets as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We put a special focus on the magnetic field-driven response of magnetic domain states and the influence of defects.
