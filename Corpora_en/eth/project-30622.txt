Impact of PCE superplasticizers on cement hydration The objective of this study is to determine how the structure of polycarboxylate ester (PCE) superplasticizers affects cement hydration by delaying the setting. Focus will be placed on systematical changes of PCEs structure and formulation and on hydration of pure mineral phases and cement.
