Fundamentals of Multi-Core Computing In the next years, computer science is going to change! While MooreSs law is likely continuing to be true, processor clock speeds can no longer be effectively increased. Instead, hardware designers have turned to multi-core architectures. In this project we study the theoretical foundations.
