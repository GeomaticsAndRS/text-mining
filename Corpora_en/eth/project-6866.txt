Fourier-Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) Fourier-Transform Mass Spectrometry is a very high resolution mass spectrometric tchnique based on magnetic trapping of ions and excitation/detection of their cyclotron frequencies. In the instrument we operate (4.7 Tesla superconducting magnet, internal MALDI source), a mass resolution exceeding 1,000,000 has been demonstrated. For many applications, high mass resolution measurements are important to correctly assign peaks in the spectrum (for example exact mass measurement refers to a way to unabigously determine a molecule's elemental composition). Since the FTMS is also an ion trap, it is very well suited for studying ion-molecule reactions, for example ion formation processes in MALDI that take place after desorption, such as gas phase protonation (cationization) reactions in the MALDI plume. Fragmentation is in this case partially controlled by relative proton (cation) affinities of matrix and analyte, quantities that are not readily available. We have measured proton affinities (PAs), gas-phase basicities (GBs), and gas-phase sodium and potassium basicities for a number of common MALDI matrices. This gives us a much better handle to describe proton and cation transfer processes taking place in teh MALDI plume. Finally, we are active in developing new open trap geometries for FT-ICR that allow much easier access, for example by external electron or laser beams.
