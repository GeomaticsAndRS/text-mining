Computational Design of Elastic Materials Using Microstructures The goal of this project is to investigate the potential of using microstuc- tures to control the elastic material properties of objects fabricated using using additive manufacturing with elastic materials. We plan to generate an approach to generate/synthesize structures that allow control over the deformation properties of a 3D printed object. The method will consist of 2 parts: In a preprocessing step, we will use an improved version of current microstructure optimization approaches to generate microstructures with desired elastic properties. We will use this method to populate a database with a sparse set of microstructures, such that new microstructures can be generated by interpolation. In a second step, we can then voxelize a 3D object and fill the individual voxels with (possibly spatially-varying) microstructures. Additionally, we can incorporate multiple databases of microstructures and run an optimization that increases the compatibility between voxels.
