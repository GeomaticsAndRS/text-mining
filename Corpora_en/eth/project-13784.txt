Sedimentologic, Petrophysical and Seismic Record of Late Quaternary Environmental Change in the Lowland Neotropics: Lake Petén-Itza Drilling Project, Guatemala. This project funds part of deep drilling operation at several sites into the more than 100 m-thick lacustrine sediment record of Lake Petén-Itza in the neotropical lowlands of Northern Guatemala, yielding a paleoenvironmental record back to or beyond the last interglacial ˜ period at 120’000 yrs B.P
