Numerical material models taking into account anisotropic hardening effects for an advanced FEM-description of sheet metal forming processes In the framework of this project, advanced yield locus models on the base of BarlatŠs YLD2000-2D and Banabic’s BBC2003 are introduced, which take into account not only the initial form but also the strain-dependent evolution of the yield loci.
