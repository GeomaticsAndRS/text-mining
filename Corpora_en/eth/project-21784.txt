Balancing Cube The Balancing Cube can balance on any one of its edges or corners. The passive structure of the cube owes its ability to a series of six mechanisms (located on each face of the cube) that rotate in concert to keep the overall system balanced. The Balancing Cube is an aluminum cube of dimension 1.2 meter that can balance on any one of its edges or corners. The passive structure of the cube owes its unusual ability to six rotating mechanisms located on each inner face of the cube that move in concert to keep the system in equilibrium. Each of the balancing mechanisms is a self-contained unit with onboard power, sensors, a computer, and a motor that can rotate the unit with respect to the rigid structure. When the mechanisms are actuated, they exert forces on the cube and shift the center of gravity of the overall system. The modular units communicate with each other and solve a joint estimation problem: the local sensor data is fused with data communicated from the other units to derive an estimate for the orientation of the cube. Based on this estimate, the mechanisms are controlled in a coordinated fashion and stabilize the cube standing on one of its corners. The Balancing Cube is a platform for research topics in the field of control engineering; in particular, in the areas of distributed and networked estimation and control.
