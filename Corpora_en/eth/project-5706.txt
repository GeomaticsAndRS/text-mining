Interreg-Project: Environmental Friendly Growing Systems of Fruits and Vegetables This project is a so called Interreg-Project between Germany and Switzerland and deals about environmental friendly growing systems of fruit and vegetables in the region of the lake of Constanz. In the whole region integrated production and ecological farming are quite common. The competitivity for these products is of importance for the further development of more ecological farming. At the IAW the market, consumption, production costs and the influence of the different laws are investigated. First, it is of interest to see the differences in production and trade between the two neighbouring countries. A second aim is to show weaknesses and advantages in the different systems. As the areas connected with this study are just on the opposite sides of a lake, people of the region want to collaborate closer on every level. So the study shall also show different ways for collaboration. An other aim is to compare this region with other regions in EU and to look at the competitivety of these regions in the fruit and vegetable sector and especially for ecologically produced goods.
