Study of Four Fermion Final States at LEP 2 The study of four fermion production processes at LEP 2 is of great interest both as test of the prediction of the standard theory at energies never attained before and also because they represent a practically irreducible background in many searches for new particles, in particular the Higgs particles. Four fermions can be produced via charged vector currents, the dominant process at LEP 2 being W pair production, studied in great detail at LEP 2. Four fermion events can also be produced via neutral vector currents, that is via the exchange of a (virtual) photon and a Z, or, at energies above 180 GeV, the production of a pair of neutral Z bosons. We have devised an analysis method which is highly efficient for the detection of four fermion final states produced via neutral current exchange. These events are characterised by the presence of either a lepton pair plus two jets, or by the presence of two lepton pairs, or also by the presence of only one lepton pair accompanied by large missing energy, when one of the Z bosons decays into a pair of neutrinos. We measure cross section as well as event characteristics, such jet and lepton energy and directions, jet pair and lepton pair masses, etc, and we compare them with the theoretical predictions. An excess of events, over the one expected from the predictions of the standard theory. could be a signature for new particle production or for unexpected new interactions.
