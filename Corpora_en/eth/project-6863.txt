Elucidation of the Mechanism of Action of Glycosidases and Related EnzymesUsing the Design and Kinetic Characterisation of Transition State Analogues;Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosidase Inhibitors Current activities involve the study of ligand-protein interactions in glycosidases, using the design and kinetic characterisation of transition state inhibitors to probe the enzymatic mechanism of action of glycosidases. These studies require the design of structurally novel inhibitor motifs on the basis of mechanistic reasoning, kinetic characterisation of the inhibition, and crystal structure analysis. A comparison of the inhibition of glucosidases, galactosidases, and mannosidases by isomeric monosaccharide-derived triazoles and related azoles has been essential for defining the role of protonation in the action of the inhibitors, and of the trajectory of protonation in the enzymatic hydrolysis. The synthesis of mono- and oligosaccharides possessing new inhibitor motifs has involved the development of new methods for the synthesis of carbocycles, carbohydrate-annulated heterocycles, and precursors to reactive intermediates; it also involved studies of reaction mechanisms.
