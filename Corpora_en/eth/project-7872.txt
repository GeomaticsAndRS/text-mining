Reflection Modulated Passive Transmitter/Photoreceivers for Passive Optical Networks During the last few years effort has been concentrated on the development of optical subscriber loop systems to take advantage of their large bandwidth and low transmission losses. To become interesting for customers, optical networks have to become cost effective. As fiber to chip transitions will remain expensive, integration is necessary to minimize the number of such transitions. We have developed a reflection modulated transmitter/photoreceiver in InP for the use in passive optical networks that eases the fiber to component alignment and promises effective detection/transmitter performance. For transmission of signals these passive InP-waveguide circuits utilize reflection modulated Mach-Zehnder Interferometers. For detection 10% of the incoming light is extracted in a novel type multi-mode-interference coupler and directed towards an integrated waveguide photodiode. The input output waveguide is horizontally and vertically tapered to reduce the coupling losses and to ease the adjustment tolerances of the optical fiber. The reflection modulated transmitter operates polarisation insensitive with fiber to fiber losses below 10dB and switching voltages below 6V and on off ratios of 15 dB at bit rates of several hundred Mb/s in the 1.3 micrometer range.
