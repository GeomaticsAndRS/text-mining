Physical model investigation of the bottom outlets of the GERD HEP In Ethiopia, the hydro power plant GERD (Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam) is currently under construction. The two bottom outlets are investigated in a hydraulic model at VAW. Special focus is laid on the flow pattern, pressure distribution and cavitation hazard and scour formation in the d/s basin. In Ethiopia, the new hydro power GERD (Grand Ethiopian renaissance Dam) is currently under construction. The two bottom outlets, which are led through the RCC dam, are investigated in a hydraulic model at VAW. As the discharge reaches 900 m3/s per outlet and the flow velocities mount up to 36 m/s for the maximum pressure head of 95 m WC, special focus is laid on the cavitation hazard. Further issues are the investigation of the flow pattern, rating curve and pressure distribution along the bottom outlets and on the circular gate. Further attention is paid to the scour formation in the down stream basin.
