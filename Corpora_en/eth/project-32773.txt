Design of zeolite-based catalysts for the upgrading of pyrolysis oil In this project we explore the application of zeolite-based catalysts in base-catalyzed liquid- and gas-phase condensation reactions relevant in the context of pyrolysis oil deoxygenation. The investigated catalysts comprise alkali metal ion-exchanged zeolites, alkaline activated zeolites and zeolit Due to their mild basicity, zeolite base catalysts obtain outstanding selectivities in liquid- and gasphase condensation reactions. In this project, we investigate and compare different approaches to obtain basic zeolites, and compare their utilization in liquid- and gas-phase aldol condensation reactions in the context of cascade bio-oil deoxygenation. In the first part, we describe the controlled generation of a new type of active sites on silica-rich FAU, BEA, and MFI zeolites, to obtain catalysts with outstanding activity, selectivity and stability in the gas-phase condensation of propanal. The moderate basicity of these novel sites leads to a superior coke resistance compared to traditional base catalysts such as CsX and MgO, while achieving comparable activity and excellent selectivity for the condensation pathways. This contribution represents a key step in the understanding and design of high-silica base catalysts that provide an inexpensive and sustainable opportunity for the intermediate deoxygenation of crude bio-oil prior to the hydrotreating step for the production of second-generation biofuels.
