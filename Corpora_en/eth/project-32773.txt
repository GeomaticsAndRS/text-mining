Design of zeolite-based catalysts for the upgrading of pyrolysis oil In this project we explore the application of zeolite-based catalysts in base-catalyzed liquid- and gas-phase condensation reactions relevant in the context of pyrolysis oil deoxygenation. The investigated catalysts comprise alkali metal ion-exchanged zeolites, alkaline activated zeolites and zeolit
