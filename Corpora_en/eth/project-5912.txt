Characterisation of the Activity of Thymopoietine on a Molecular Level The thymic hormones are characterized by their important role for the regulation of the human immune system. One of these hormones is thymopoietine, which was isolated from calf thymus, consists of 49 amino acids and was found to stimulate the maturation of lymphocytes to T-cells. The active site of thymopoietine was identified as thymopoietine 32-36, which was named TP5 or thymopentin. Although clinical success was found in various studies, the activity of thymopoietine and TP5 on the molecular level has not yet been identified. In order to characterize the biological response, anologues of TP5 were synthesized which contain photoactivatable groups. Biotin-, fluorescence- and radiolabels are additionally used for tracing of the ligand after photocrosslinking. The activity and crosslinking yield of the different TP5 analogues is investigated on human lymphocytes, which are reported to be a major target of immunomodulators.
