2x2 Optical InP/InGaAsP Waveguide Space Switches with High Performances Optical waveguide space switches are needed to switch the flow of information in fiber-optic communication systems. The 2x2 waveguide space switches are one of the elementary components in integrated optics. The InP/InGaAsP material system is very attractive since it allows the integration of waveguides with optical amplifiers, detectors and electronic drivers. We developed and fabricated 2x2 InP/InGaAsP Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches, which are based on electric field effects. They are attractive because of the possibility to reach low insertion losses, high on-off ratios, polarization-insensitive operation, and high switching speeds. Incoming light is distributed into the two arms of the MZI with a Multi-Mode Interference (MMI) coupler, propagated through the different paths and finally recombined using a second MMI coupler. The phase shifting waveguides of the MZI-switches (structured as reversed biased pn-junctions) are oriented at such an angle with respect to the cleaved facets of the (100) InP chips, that the Pockels and the Franz-Keldysh electro-optic effects result in polarizationindependent operation. As 3 dB optical power splitters and combiners we use MMI couplers, because of their polarization-insensitive, fabrication- and wavelength-tolerant properties. Obtained switching voltages are less than 5 Volts. Crosstalk is better than 18 dB and 25 dB for worst and best case of polarizations, respectively. Insertion losses between microscope objectives are as low as 5 dB for the two polarizations.
