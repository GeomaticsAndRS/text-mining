Water Use and Management in Egypt and Sudan and its Implications on Conflict and Cooperationin the Nile Basin This Ph.D. thesis examines the use and management of water resources in Egypt and Sudan and how this affects the international relations in the Eastern Nile basin. The thesis is being carried out in the framework of the Environment and Cooperation in the Nile Basin (ECONILE) research project, focusing on the downstream perspective. There are three levels to this study: 1) The assessment of the environmental resources (freshwater and land use). 2) The economic significance and the policies related to water use on the national level, including water development projects. 3) The influence of the national management on the international area. This will also include gathering lessons learned from the Nile Basin Initiative process, which began in 1999. Approaches from conflict, systems and public policy theories are used. Thus actors, their perceptions and the interactions between actors and the environment are to be analysed. As far as possible this will include an assessment of actors' needs, interests and positions as well as the resources they have at their disposal to reach these aims. Methods used include explorative expert interviews and literature research. The study of environmental aspects in Egypt is being supervised by Prof. Dr. Waleed Hamza, Dept. Environmental Science, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University, Egypt. The study of environmental aspects in Sudan is being supervised by Prof. Dr. Osman Mirghani Mohamed Ali, Institute of Environmental Studies, University of Khartoum, Sudan. The political aspects in Sudan are being supervised by Prof. Dr. Atta El-Battahani, Department of Political Science, University of Khartoum, Sudan.
