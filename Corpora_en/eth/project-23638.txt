Thermophysical properties of Fe-Mn-Pd alloys The thermophysical properties of Fe-Mn-Pd alloys are investigated by mechanical tests, calorimetry, microstructural studies (optical microscopy, TEM), and atom-probe tomography. It is the aim to understand the alloysS exceptional strength and hardness increase from a metal physical point of view.
