The Microbe-Host Interface: Molecular Mechanisms Mediating Protective and Pathological Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses within the Gut Our hypothesis is that a dysbiotic microbial community is a key determinant in increasing the risk of colitis. The overall goal of this project is therefore to elucidate molecular mechanisms of host-microbiota interactions in acute colitis and design microbial strategies for the treatment of IBD .
