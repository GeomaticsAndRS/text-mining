Design and Analysis of Fabric Formwork This research explores the integral analysis and design of fabric formwork and the resulting concrete geometries. Fabric formwork is characterized by the use of coated fabrics or geotextiles as the main material for a concrete mold. This method allows concrete`s inherent fluidity to create new forms of concrete architecture and aesthetics. The design considerations for these formworks are similar to those in the design and engineering of tensioned membrane structures, involving the interaction of prestress, non-linear material behavior and the support conditions. Additionally, fabric formwork has concrete pressures, fluid structure interaction and fabric wrinkling as complicating factors. Through combinations of form finding and analysis, this research aims to develop new tools for the structurally informed design of fabric formed structural systems.
