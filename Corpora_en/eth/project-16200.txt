Stability of simulations of complex stochastic differential equations with applications in quantum statistical mechanics Path integrals can be computed by stochastic differential equations because this procedure is easily simulated. Simulations of Bose-Einstein condensation using these procedures are known to be unstable, however, so a more serious error analysis is underway.
