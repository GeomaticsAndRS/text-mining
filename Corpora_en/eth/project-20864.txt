Spinal and Cortical Representation (fMRI) of Gait in Chronic Cord Injury This project evaluates the rehabilitative training of spinal cord injured patients by measuring brain activity during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, a newly developed MR-compatible stepper provides gait-like movements (rotations in hip and knee joints, foot loading).
