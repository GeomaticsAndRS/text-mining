Structural and mechanistic studies of ABC transporter proteins ABC transporters are membrane proteins that facilitate unidirectional substrate translocation across the lipid bilayer. To understand their mechanisms, atomic structures of bacterial homologs are determined using X-ray crystallography, and the activity is investigated in vitro.
