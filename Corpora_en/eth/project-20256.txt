Bits to Energy Lab The Bits to Energy Lab aims at improving the resource- and energy effi- ciency in both industrial and home environments using IT and especially Ubiquitous Computing technologies. MOTIVATION Ecological aspects are of growing importance in the decision making of both citizens and companies who have to determine which product or service to choose, which production process to implement, and which logistic service to select. Since ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) technologies can help to measure, assign, and communicate the ecological effects of producing, selling, and using individual items, it may help companies to optimize their processes and enable consumers to select environmentally friendly products. OBJECTIVES AND CHALLENGES Against this background, the Lab is dedicated to investigating the potential benefits of UbiComp technologies for a sustainable development. The Bits to Energy Lab aims at: T ¸ Supporting reporting activities with respect to energy consumption and green house gas emissions T ¸ Increasing the eco-efficiency of production and transportation systems T ¸ Reducing energy and fuel consumption in home environments T ¸ Enabling the consumer to select environmentally friendly products and services Concrete challenges / actual research areas include: T ¸ Understanding the value of sensor information on the example of distributing and selling perishable goods T ¸ Making the ecological footprint of products transparent on item-level T ¸ Investigating the changes in user behavior (i.e. rebound effects and positive third order effects) when e.g. GHG emissions are communicated for each item
