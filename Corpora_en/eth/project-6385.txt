Metabolic Engineering of Cell Cycle Dynamics in Cultured Cells I The CHO (Chinese hamster ovary cells) K1 cell line is widely used for the production of pharmaceutically important proteins. The medium used in these processes usually contains 10% or more fetal calf serum (FCS). FCS contains growth factors which are necessary to induce proliferation of CHO cells.We could show that elevated expression of cyclin E occurs in the CHO cells following mitogenic stimulation. Cyclin E is a major controlling factor in the CHO cell cycle; we could then demonstrate, that after transfection constitutive overexpression of human cyclin E abolished growth factor and serum dependence for proliferation. The transfected cell line CHO K1: cyc E proliferated in basal medium completely free of serum and protein with growth rates comparable to cells growing in serum containing medium. We think that controlled activation of cell division will have major biotechnological benefits, particularly if performed in serumfree medium.
