The Sources of Nuclear Behavior Combining theoretical approaches to proliferation with historical research on specific nuclear weapons programs, the project aims at understanding and explaining the sources and underlying motivations of nuclear proliferation. The project aims at establishing a new basis for research on the origins and the trajectory of nuclear proliferation in a historical perspective. By making available new archival and other sources on the nuclear decision-making of states, the project enables the refining and recalibrating of existing theoretical approaches towards this phenomenon. In 2009, a theoretical concept and research agenda has been developed. This was followed by the convening of an international conference in Zurich in June 2010 bringing together political scientists and historians working on nuclear proliferation. Building on this event, a global network of researchers aiming at a renewal of proliferation research has been established. The results of the conference will be published in an edited volume in late 2011.
