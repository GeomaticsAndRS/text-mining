Evaluation of the current Swiss Agricultural Market Policy (AP 2002) Based on Swiss law, the agricultural policy has to be evaluated periodically. New policy reforms are being developed to extend the new agricultural policy (AP 2002). Moreover, there are changes in the general conditions for Swiss agriculture, e.g. the implementa-tion of the Bilateral Contracts with the European Union and the current WTO-negotiations. These pol-icy evaluations are a base for further development of actual and new political instruments in Swiss agriculture. The goal of the evaluation project called MAAP 2002 is the scientific analyses of the current in-struments concerning the agricultural market policy. As a result of this project, some recommendations are given for further changes in the Swiss agricultural market policy. The evaluation emphasises the legitimation, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the most important instruments. Four different product markets are evaluated in the project MAAP 2002: the grain market, the dairy market, the meat market and the egg market. Partial economic-mathematical models are used for the analysis. The actual market situations and their developments are explained by positive model approaches (statistics and econometrics). Equilibrium and optimisation models are used for the evaluation of alternative policy measures.
