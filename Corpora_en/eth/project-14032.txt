blue-c-II blue-c II ist ein Gemeinschaftsprojekt der Professuren CAAD, CGL, CVG, IWF und ZPE der ETH. Der Focus dieses Projektes liegt im zwei-dimensionalen und dreidimensionalen erfassen von Räumen, Personen und Objekten sowie in der Weiterverarbeitung und im Nutzen der erfassten Daten. The typical interaction schemes of the new virtual project room will be applied to the pre-study and the conceptual design phase of product development. The goal is to use this co-located and networked teamwork in order to elaborate, collect and share data such as envisioned product placement, competitive assessment, functional product definition or feasibility results as well as to and SMDM build up an extended function structure (EFS), researched on the projects SEVA ¸ T ¸ T. The collected data will be stored in a database and regarding the pre-study phase processed in a dynamic workflow which meets the specific needs of each pre-study project. The final goal of those two projects is to improve the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of the pre-study and conceptual design process which transfers a product idea into a product concept, a requirement specification list and finally into the development design by applying new communication technologies.
