Identification of candidate genes responsible for zinc and iron loading into wheat grains Plants are known to maintain metal ion homeostasis through sophisticated molecular mechanisms that tightly control the acquisition and distribution of metal ions to the specific compartments and for storage. We study the molecular mechanisms underlying micro-nutrient composition in the wheat grains. Large proportion of worldSs population is affected by mineral malnutrition, most prominently iron and zinc deficiencies. Cereals, the important source of food worldwide, are a poor source of micronutrients. Therefore, enriching the edible parts of staple cereals such as wheat and rice with bioavailable iron and zinc would significantly contribute to solve the issue of micro-nutrient malnutrition. Plants are known to maintain metal ion homeostasis through sophisticated molecular mechanisms that tightly control the acquisition and distribution of metal ions to the specific compartments and for storage. Studies on different plant species have allowed identification of several transporters that are potentially involved in metal ion homeostasis. Most of these transporters belong to gene families and are capable of transporting one or several metal ions (including Fe, Zn). However, specific function of many of these transporters remains unclear and currently, we are very much limited on the knowledge of bottlenecks for transport of metals to grains. In this project, we study the molecular mechanisms underlying micro-nutrient composition in the wheat grains, focusing on zinc and iron. The project is expected to generate interesting information on candidate genes that can be followed up in breeding strategies or genetic engineering approaches to improve grain micronutrient content, such as zinc and Fe, in cereals.
