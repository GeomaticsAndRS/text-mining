The Bearingless Electromotor At the ETHZ Laboratory of Electrical Engineering Design, a bearingless electromotor was developed with a rotor which is mounted contact-free. The innovation is that the magnetic forces for the suspension of the rotor are generated in the motor itself and not in separate magnetic bearings. This is achieved by a special winding and an electronic control device. The construction of the electromotor still remains very simple, as the prototype of the bearingless induction motor from the ETH Zurich proves. It is built with only standard motor elements. The principle of the bearingless electromotor was successfully demonstrated with a synchronous machine as well. Therefore, it can be used in a large range of machines from low power motors up to large synchronous generators. As the bearingless electromotor is constructed with contact-free bearings, it works free of wear, frictionless, free of abrasion and without lubricants. Applications of the contact-free mounted motor lie in the fields of high vacuum technology, clean room technology, medicine technology, food technology and ultra high-speed drives. For further development of the bearingless motor, two industrial partners were found: Sulzer Electronics AG (Switzerland) and Lust Antriebstechnik GmbH (Germany). Together with our partners, we intend to develop industrial applications of the bearingless drive technology in the fields of canned pumps and medicine technology. Besides this application-oriented work, further investigations will be done on the layout and construction of the motor, and on the related rotor dynamics together with the ETHZ institutes for Electrical Machines and Robotics.
