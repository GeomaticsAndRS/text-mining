SNF-Projekt 200020-113700 √ènformation-Theoretic Cryptography", Forschungsbereich Mathematik, Naturwissenschaften"(Abteilung 2) The goal of this project is to reduce the gap between information-theoretic and complexity-theoretic cryptography, making information-theoretic security more practical. In particular, we intend to study new cryptographic primitives, as for instance cryptographic functions and storage devices.
