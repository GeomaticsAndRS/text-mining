Nanoindentation of Soft Materials and Biological Tissue In collaboration with CSEM and CSM Instruments a novel set-up is realized for characterization of soft materials using indentation. Numerical models are used to interpret the data and detrmine constitutive model parameters for non-linear viscoelastic behavior. Nanoindentation is a powerful technique for highly localized mechanical characterization of hard materials. The present project will enable the application of nanoindentation to softer materials and biological tissue. This application is currently affected by two main problems: (i) lack of models for the identification of meaningful parameters from measured data; (ii) measurement uncertainties related to contact detection and control of test environment to reproduce physiological conditions of hydration and temperature. The proposed project will address these issues and enable the realization of a new instrument and data analysis tools for nanoindentation of soft materials.
