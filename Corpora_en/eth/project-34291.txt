precoR Project SHG This project aims at the on-chip generation of signals by means of second harmonic generation, difference frequency generation and sum frequency generation employing a novel thin nonlinear polymer/monomer materials incorporated into a strong-confinement low-loss plasmonic waveguide structures.
