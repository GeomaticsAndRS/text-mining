Methodologies for biological network inference In this project, we are developing new methodology for gene regulatory network inference. The method will be built based on ensemble inference strategy to take into account the underdetermined nature of the inference problem. The inference of biological networks has important applications, from finding treatment of diseases to engineering of microbes to produce drugs and biofuels. Despite tremendous efforts from different disciplines to tackle this problem, resulting in hundreds of algorithms and examples, such inference is still very much an unsolved problem. Findings from a community-wide benchmark and assessment (DREAM challenge) revealed that combining results from a variety of methods generally give more reliable network predictions. In this project, we are developing new hybrid methods for network inference. The new hybrid method will be built based on the integration of data-driven and model-based methods, in which the former will be used to infer the network in a top-down manner, while the latter will be used to predict the network bottom up. The selection of methods will be based on the underlying assumptions of each respective method, such that the combined algorithm will have diversified assumptions. This is done so that the consequences from an invalid assumption of one method, can be mitigated. The two project tracks above are naturally synergistic and the project is planned such that progress made in one will immediately benefit the other.
