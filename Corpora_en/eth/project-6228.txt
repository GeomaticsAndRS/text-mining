Expert System for Road Accident Analysis For well over 20 years the so called Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis (VTUA) method has been applied in Switzerland to find causes for road accidents. However the use of this method requires extensive engineering expertise. This study tries to develop a tool helping the engineer doing a Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis faster and with more reliability. The output of this expert system - based on extensive information from engineering, standards and data processing capabilities - should provide diagnostic and prognostic results with respect to the accident causes. It is also intended to apply and test available statements of artificial intelligence. The expert system pursues three goals: - that the Traffic Engineering Accident Analysis method will be applied more often - that pertinent measures to improve road safety are found faster and - that these measures will be more reliable.
