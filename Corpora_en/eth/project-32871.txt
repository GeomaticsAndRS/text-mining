Supported silver and gold nanoparticles for selective three-phase hydrogenation of acetylenic substrates This work evaluates the performance of silver and gold-based catalysts in the gas and three-phase hydrogenation of alkynes, an important reaction for the purification of olefin streams and the manufacture of fine chemicals. Supported silver and gold nanocatalysts, displaying average particle size in the range of 2-21 nm, were prepared by using distinct deposition methods, activation conditions, metal loadings, and carriers. The samples were characterized by ICP-OES, XRF, N2 sorption, XPS, HAADF-STEM, and HRTEM, and evaluated in the gas- and three-phase hydrogenation of acetylenic compounds in continuous mode. Both catalysts proved to be highly selective (>90%) to the alkene. The reaction rate, however, was maximal over 2-5 nm particles, suggesting that the adsorption of reactants is favored by the presence of defects on Au and Ag nanoparticles. While the performance of the silver catalysts was less influenced by the support, the gold nanoparticles exhibited significant activity only when deposited on TiO2, likely due to strong metal-support interactions. The hydrogenations of functionalized alkynes revealed that silver and gold matched, and in some cases exceeded, the selectivity of benchmark palladium-based catalysts. Furthermore, in contrast to Pd, the Ag and Au samples required no modifiers, bringing fundamental and practical simplifications for their understanding and large scale manufacture. Therefore, these materials could be advantageously used for the continuous production of olefinic intermediates in the fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries.
