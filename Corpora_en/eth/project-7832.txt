Optical Phase Conjugation with Photorefractive Crystals A time reversed optical wave in an inhomogeneous but non-absorbing medium has very interesting and useful properties and the process of producing such waves is usually called optical phase conjugation. Diffrent mechanisms like stimulated scattering and four wave mixing may be used to produce phase conjugate beams and the applications span a broad range, e.g. improvement of the laser coherence, heterodyne detection, and optical communications. The nonlinear optical phase conjugation by using photorefractive materials has the advantage that such devices can operate at relatively low light intensities in comparison to the high intensities necessary in other nonlinear processes. Our efforts are directed towards better self-pumped phase conjugation in cat configuration, which is known to produce the best fidelity of the conjugated beams, towards conjugation in external ring resonators which can give a faster response time and we study also double incoherent phase conjugation which is especially interesting for applications where the interaction between two incoherent laser sources is needed.
