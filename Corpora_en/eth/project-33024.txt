Asymptotic solution of the temperature field in stagnant lid convection simulations, effect of a pressure-dependent rheology We present a new analytical formulation of the internal temperature and the Nusselt number reached in numerical simulations of mantle convection, with pressure-dependent viscosity. We derive a new formalism for Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheologies. Numerical results match the analytical prediction
