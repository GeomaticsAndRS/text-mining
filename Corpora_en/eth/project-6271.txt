Water Transport in a MSW Incinerator Bottom Ash Landfill In this project, the water transport in a MSW incinerator bottom ash landfill is investigated. Knowledge about the spatial and temporal leachate production makes it possible to design optimal sites for new landfills or to deal with enclosed landfills. With this knowledge, additional information is provided concerning the long-term behaviour of such landfills. In a first step, the phenomena which affect the water transport are investigated and estimated. Afterwards models are used to describe the water transport physically and mathematically. A data set from the landfill Riet close to the city of Winterthur in Switzerland is used to calibrate the models.
