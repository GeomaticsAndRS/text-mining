zCOSMOS zCOSMOS will measure the redshifts of approximately 37,000 galaxies in the 2 degree square COSMOS survey field that has been imaged with the HST and with a host of other observational facilities in the optical, uv, radio and X-ray bands. zCOSMOS will measure the redshifts of approximately 37,000 galaxies in the 2 degree square COSMOS survey field that has been imaged with the HST and with a host of other observational facilities in the optical, uv, radio and X-ray bands. The redshifts are measured using the VIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the ESO VLT and 540 hrs of observation (the largest external award of VLT time) have been awarded to this project.
