Development of the Electronics Chain for the CMS ElectromagneticCalorimeter Meeting the specifications established for the more than 100'000 crystals of the crystal calorimeter (ECAL) presents a technical challenge for the front-end electronics. Signals must be acquired and stored at the LHC crossing frequency of 40 MHz with an accuracy that does not degrade the intrinsic detector resolution. A large dynamic range is required from the front-end electronics. Signals must be digitised from the noise floor (50MeV) up to 2.5TeV. In addition, the overall resolution should be better than 1% to maintain the best possible resolution for the Higgs decay into two gamma. The overall dynamic range requirements are noise limited for low energies and detector resolution limited at higher energies. The ECAL readout chain consists of a photodetector, the very front-end electronics (VFE) to capture the photodetector signal and the front-end electronics (FE) to digitise it, as well as the interfaces to the trigger and Data Acquisition systems. For The VFE consists of a preamplifier, shaping and analog compression electronics and a line driver to the FE which includes the ADC. For the signal acquisition and digitisation, a multichip module design is considered.
