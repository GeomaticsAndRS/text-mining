Exploration of microscale ciliary transducers This project will explore ciliary micro-transducers from device physics to fabrication of demonstrators and characterization, to assess their suitability for technical applications. The underlying sensing concept, inspired from nature, holds great promise as a building block for future applications. The objective of this project is the exploration of novel microscale ciliary (hair-based) transducers. In nature, mechanical sensing based on the displacement or bending of small hairs is a very common concept, providing extremely low detection thresholds upon mechanical stimuli. It allows fish and crickets to recognize water or air flows patterns generated by their enemies. Also in the mammalian ear, tiny hairs play an important role in the transduction mechanism. Such a successful concept created by evolution holds great promise for use in technical applications. While there have been developed MEMS-based demonstrators by different research groups, their footprints are still in the 0.1-1 mm range for width and length. Especially when high spatial resolution is desired, array compatible microscale transducers with even smaller footprints and extraordinarily low power consumptions have clear advantages. In sparse arrays, in contrast, they allow to reduce the overall area consumption. This project aims at both, developing a fabrication process and obtaining a better physical understanding of further miniaturized ciliary transducers with footprints of the entire active element on the order of 10x10 um^2. Operation in both, liquid and air is envisioned. The results are expected to help in judging in what configurations and for which specific sensor applications artificial microscale ciliary transducers are suited as a building block.
