Environmental Assessment of Water Consumption and Water Shortage Worldwide increasing water shortage requires assessing the environmental impacts of water consumption. However, a scientifically sound Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology for water use is not yet available. The project will develop an assessment methodology for water consumption in the context of LCA including following Sub-goals: Analysis of water consumption patterns in industry and other economic sectors Qualitative vulnerability analyses of the changing availability of water resources, identifying stress factors on diverse ecosystems and human groups in different regions Description and quantification of the cause-effect chains (integration of vulnerability-assessment results and potential environmental effects) Development and application of a generic assessment method to quantify the impact of water use on humans and the natural environment Adaptation of the proposed assessment method to the most important LCA methodologies and existing life cycle inventories (LCI) GIS-based data evaluation, correlation analyses and case studies in cooperation with industrial partners are methods applied.
