On some large deformation problems in tunnelling Tunnelling through squeezing rocks is characterized by sometimes extremely large convergences of the tunnel cross section, which may exceed 1-2 m and lead even to total closure of the opening. Large axial deformations are observed sometimes also at the excavation face. They are insofar problematic as they lead to a convex shape of the face, which is unfavourable for stability (negative arching). Particular large deformations (more than 20-30% strain) and displacements (several meters) are observed also in tunnelling through swelling rocks. Inspite of such observations, almost all computational models are based upon infinitensimal strain theory. The latter involves an error, which is unknown so far, and may lead to qualitatively wrong results. From the design point of view, analyses which are based on the theory of finite deformations allow for a rational prediction of the expected ground response when great convergences take place, in combination with a detailed investigation of the ground-support interaction to tunnel excavation. Furthermore, taking into consideration material as well as geometric nonlinearities, failure mechanisms may be produced which otherwise cannot be captured. This thesis aims to present a complete framework for the analysis of tunnels subjected to remarkable deformations, providing a deep insight into the examined problems with respect to both the physical and mathematical aspects.
