Recycling of Bituminous and Tar Bound Road Materials in Cement Bound SubbaseCourses Growing amounts of bituminous and tar bound recycling materials makes it necessary to find ways to re-use these materials. One possibility is to use them in cement bound subbase courses. Therefore extensive laboratory tests and accompaning field tests are carried out in order to determine mixtures leading to optimized behavior and bearing characteristics of such layers.
