Algorithmic Design of Structural Systems for Tall Buildings In todaySs trend towards urbanization, tall buildings offer a potential for reducing both urban sprawl and the per capital CO2 emissions of a city. As a further increase of their importance is expected, it is proposed to investigate their structural design in a contemporary context. Historically, advances in the structural design have always been made possible by parallel advances in the technology. In this research, it is argued, that recent advances in computer aided design (CAD), namely algorithmic design, can have a similar impact on the structural design of tall buildings as FEM has had, giving the architect and engineer more freedom of design. The aim of this research is to generate unprecedented shapes and forms towards the structural design of tall buildings that allow for both structural soundness and architectural expression. Attention is given to differentiation along the height of the structure in order to foster design and programmatic flexibility, while at the same time conforming to varied structural requirements.
