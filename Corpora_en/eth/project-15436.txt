NMR assignments of amide moieties in the backbone of 15N isotope labeled proteins with known crystal structure In this project a resonance assignment method shall be developed that requires only 15N isotope labeling of proteins and no 13C labeling as the conventional approach. Many more protein structures were/are determined by X-ray crystallography in single crystals than by NMR in solution. However, the structure is only the starting point of detailed investigations of macromolecules. For example, dynamic properties of proteins, protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions are key issues. For some of these investigations NMR is very well suited and for the corresponding investigations often only 15N isotope labeled proteins are necessary. If the X-ray structure is available an efficient assignment procedure using only 15N labeled proteins is therefore highly desirable to avoid expensive 13C,15N labeling required for conventional assignment procedures which are often time consuming and difficult to obtain for large systems.
