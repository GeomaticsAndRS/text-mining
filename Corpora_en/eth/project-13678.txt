Rapidly Oscillating Solutions of Stiff Delay Differential Equations The goal is to establish and investigate rapidly oscillating solutions for stiff delay differential equations. The nonlinearity models either positive or negative feedback. The equation under consideration is x'(t) = - mu x(t) + mu f(x(t-1)) (*). In a first step stable rapidly oscillating periodic solutions of (*) are established for piecewise constant nonlinearities f of the type f(x) = -a for 0 < x < 1 and f(x) = -b for x > 1, where a > b > 0, and f(-x) = -f(x) for x > 0. For some fixed numerical values of a, b and mu satisfying a > 1 > b the result was established by Aschwanden, Schulze-Halberg and Stoffer using a computer-assisted proof method, see project 8636. Now we are able to prove the result analytically for (a,b) in some open set in the a-b-plane provided mu is sufficiently large. The next step ist to analytically establish stable and unstable rapidly oscillating periodic solutions in the case a > b > 1 for mu sufficiently large. This case complements a computer-assisted result obtained earlier by Schulze-Halberg. Numerical experiments indicate that there exist rapidly oscillating heteroclinic solutions connecting an unstable to a stable peridic solution. We expect that the analytical methods extend to this case for mu sufficiently large. Part of the results have already been extended to C^1-nonlinearities f_eps that are suficciently close to the step function f introduced above. A challenging problem to address is the case of a smooth nonlinearity far from a piecewise constant function. It is encouraging that numerical experiments indicate that the type of phenomena described above is indeed present for the case of the sine-function.
