Radiogenic Isotopes in Ferromanganese crusts: New Tools to Reconstruct Weathering Intensityand Ocean Circulation Ferromaganese crusts are chemical sediments which accumulate at extremely slow rates on the order of 1-10 mm per Million years by direct precipitation of Fe-Mn oxihydroxides from the ocean deep water. The isotopic composition of dissolved trace metals (Nd, Pb, Hf) which serves a s proxy-indicator for particular water masses has been incorporated and recorded in ferromanganese crusts over millions of years. Following dating of the crusts using the radioactive cosmogenic beryllium isotope 10Be (half-life = 1.5 million years) the isotopic composition of a water mass for the past up to 60 million years can be reconstructed. Two major processes are essentially responsible for variations in isotopic composition at a given location. The first is a change in ocean circulation caused by either horizontal or vertical changes in the pathways of water bodies with different isotopic composition, which are mostly climatically forced. The second is a change in the isotopic composition of a water mass itself due to changes in the input of weathered material from the continents which partly dissolves and releases its isotopic composition to sea water. Additionally, paleogeographically forced opening sand closings of major oceanic seaways can cause variations in the isotopic composition of water masses. The new technique of multi-collector ICPMS enables very precise measurement of these trace metal isotope ratios and is the basis for the reconstructions of ocean circulation and weathering intensity, which currently focuses on study sites in the north and South Pacific ocean, as well as the equatorial Atlantic ocean.
