Can energetic terahertz pulses initiate surface catalytic reactions on the picosecond time scale? In prepn. for picosecond pump-probe expts. at the SwissFELX-ray laser facility, the feasibility of collectively initiating surface chem. reactions using energetic pulses of terahertz radiation is being tested.
