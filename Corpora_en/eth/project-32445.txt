Causes and time scales of fluid release from magma chambers related to ore-forming magmatic-hydrothermal systems, II The project investigates, via combined fluid dynamical and thermodynamic numerical simulation, by which mechanisms and on which time scales volatiles can be exsolved from a magma chamber in the earthSs crust, ultimately leading to the formation of porphyrycopper (-gold, -molybdenum) ore deposits.
