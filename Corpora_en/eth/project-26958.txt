Suspended Sediment monitoring and wear of Pelton turbines Suspended sediment, turbine wear and efficiency are monitored at a Swiss high-head hydropower plant (Fieschertal). An in-situ laser diffractometer is used to measure particle concentration and size distribution in real-time. The project contributes to improved monitoring and forcasting capability.
