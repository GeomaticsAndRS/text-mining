Domain analysis in polarization flop multiferroic materials We investigate the evolution of the ferroelectric domain pattern upon the rotation of the spontaneous polarization in several mutliferroic materials. The ferroelectric domain patterns in multiferroic materials like o-TbMnO3, MnWO4, and LiCuVO4 are imaged using non-linear optical second harmonic generation. In these spin-spiral multiferroic materials application of a magnetic field can induce the (aprupt or continous) rotation of the spontaneous polarization. Here we investigate the evolution of the ferroelectric domain pattern under such a polarization rotation to understand the properties of the magnetic domain walls.
