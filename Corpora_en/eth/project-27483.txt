Microfluidic tool for age synchronisation of C. elegans nematodes This project aims to develop high-throughput microfluidic tools for the analysis of live organisms. Specifically we will develop a passive microfluidic strategy for sorting adult C. elegans nematodes on the basis of age and size. The separation mechanism will take advantage of phenotypic ´ ´ differences between SadultS and SjuvenileS organisms and their behaviour in microfluidic architectures. A range of fundamental studies in aging and developmental biological research require the production of age-synchronized populations. These are extremely difficult to produce using conventional techniques due to the fast growth rates of worms. This means that in a matter of days the Smother ¸ T sample becomes contaminated with younger progeny. There are several methods for separating worms, however they all possess significant drawbacks: manual picking is tedious and time consuming, chemical sterilization perturbs the wormSs biology and mechanical sorting is complicated and expensive. The proposed microfluidic architectures will allow the passive separation of adult and juvenile worms at throughputs in excess of 106 worms per hour.
