Pulse EPR and ENDOR studies of Bis(sulfoximine)Cu(II) complexes Transition metals complexes with diphosphines or chelating compounds with nitrogens as donor atoms are of great interest because of their catalytic properties in hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. Recently, a new class of C2-symmetric chelating agents was introduced, namely the chiral bis(sulfoximine) ligand (S,S), which forms Cu(II) complexes with excellent catalytic properties (products with enantioselectivities up to 99% ee). The aim of this research is to study the geometric and electronic structure of the Cu(II)-(S,S) complexes with different pulse EPR and ENNDOR techniques. The effects of the solvent and the metal salt on the structure of the catalytically active complex will also be studied. (in collaboration with Prof. G. Gescheidt, Graz, and Prof. C. Bolm, Aachen)
