Jet-Powered Wingsuit A multidisciplinary, pioneering research project to explore the potential of true human flight, by developing a fly-by-wire control system to increase the manoeuvrability, stability, range, and safety of a jet-powered wingsuit. Wingsuits are made of flexible and lightweight fabric and are intimately connected to the body, allowing the flyer to control the flight speed and direction with subtle and intuitive body movements. They are limited to glide ratios of about 2.5:1, meaning that for every 1 m of altitude loss, the wearer can only fly forward 2.5 m. One way to increase their range is to use some form of thrust. In October 2005 Visa Parviainen from Finland became the first person in the world to fly a wingsuit powered with small jet engines secured to his feet. His current system is capable of about 4 minutes of level flight, although he does experience difficulty in maintaining a constant and efficient flying speed. We have studied unpowered wingsuit flight using a sophisticated flight recorder (a combined GPS, MEMS-based IMU, and barometer), and have developed and verified a mathematical model for longitudinal wingsuit flight. This model predicts phugoid mode instability for jet-powered wingsuits, which is very likely the explanation for the speed instability Visa has experienced during flight. Our research will now focus on flight tests performed using a comparatively low thrust (and low cost) Electric Ducted Fan powered wingsuit. In comparison with fuel-burning gas turbine propulsion, this system will serve as a safer and more convenient test platform for the design and testing of control algorithms.
