In-cylinder combustion research for the determination of turbocharging requirements for future large diesel engines with Miller valve timing, exhaust gas recirculation and multiple injections This project aims to provide an understanding of the phenomena which combustion, as well as provide solutions which will allow the applead to problems with Scold ¸ T lication of Miller valve timing for increased NOx reduction and offer guidelines which will help with future turbocharger system design. Future large diesel engines are required to meet more stringent emission regulations, especially regarding NOx emissions. An established method for the reduction of NOx emissions is the adaptation Miller valve timing, whereby the inlet valve is closed before the bottom dead centre, allowing the in-cylinder charge to expand prior to compression, leading to lower cycle temperatures and NOx formation during combustion. Past research into the application of Miller timing combustion, which this project aims to address. has highlighted problems with this type of Scold ¸ T The main goal of this project is to provide a further understanding of the phenomena which lead to combustion, as well as provide solutions which will allow the problems encountered with Scold ¸ T the application of Miller valve timing for increased NOx emission reduction and offer guidelines which will help in the determination of optimal future turbocharger system design. The solutions which are envisioned to improve the NOx emission reduction potential of the Miller valve timing include exhaust gas recirculation and multiple injections. The bulk of the research will be conducted through experimental investigations on a single-cylinder diesel engine research facility, and the outcome is foreseen to include phenomenological combustion and emission models capable of predicting combustion and emissions at these conditions.
