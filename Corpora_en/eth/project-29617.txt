In-cylinder combustion research for the determination of turbocharging requirements for future large diesel engines with Miller valve timing, exhaust gas recirculation and multiple injections This project aims to provide an understanding of the phenomena which lead to problems with Scold ¸ Tˇ combustion, as well as provide solutions which will allow the application of Miller valve timing for increased NOx reduction and offer guidelines which will help with future turbocharger system design.
