Understanding consequences of introgression of insecticidal transgenes from Bt-maize into open pollinating maize varieties in South Africa and its impact on pest resistance evolution Investigate how introgression and expression of Bt transgenes into maize landraces may impact evolution of resistance in target pests of maize against Bt toxins. In South Africa, there is no physical or biological barrier to transgene flow from commercial GM hybrid maize to landraces of maize.
