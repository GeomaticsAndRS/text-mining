NT-UltraSoundToGo UltrasoundToGo intends to develop a high-performance, low-power signal processing platform for ultrasound imaging applications, targeting future 3D portable ultrasound systems. Battery operation and high quality 3D imaging leads to much easier use also by nonspecifically-trained personnel.
