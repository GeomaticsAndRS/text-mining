Far distant galaxies at the reonization frontier of the Universe We are using forefront Hubble Space Telescope data, as well as spectroscopic follow up observations at the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory ~ and at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, to hunt for far distant galaxies out to redshifts of order z10.
