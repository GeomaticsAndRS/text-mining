Search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model in e-p collisions One of the biggest secrets in particle physics is the quest for the number of generations of leptons and quarks. Up to now a total of three generations have been observed experimentally. However, the standard model does not and cannot give reasons for this number of generations. Various theoretical models have been developped in attempts to explain this fact. Models, based on possible substructuress of quarks and leptons, predict the existence of excited states of all fermions, observed up to now. Within the H1-experiment we study various possible signatures for hints on physics beyond the standard model (BSM): excited fermions, SUSY-particle, leptoquarks, extremely long lived particles and others.
