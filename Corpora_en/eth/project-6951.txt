EXAFS The Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) method is applied in the structure determination of sites at catalyst surfaces. One project is concerned with the surface composition of small, catalytically active alloy clusters on Al$_{2}$_{3}$and SiO$_{2}$supports, and in the cavities of zeolite Y. In particular the alloy surface at the alloy-support interface is studied. A second project concerns the catalyst surface of hydrotreating catalysts. By studying the EXAFS spectra before and after adsorption of adsorbates on the surface of supported Ni-MoS2 and Co-MoS2 catalysts, we try to determine whether Ni or Mo sites are responsible for the catalysis in promoted hydrotreating catalysts. The mode of adsorption (\gp or \gs) of sulphur-containing molecules is investigated by adsorption of selenophene on such catalysts. In 1995 the X-ray absorption studies will be transfered from Daresbury, England, to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. Measurements will be done on ESRF beamlines, as well as on the Swiss-Norvegian beamline.
