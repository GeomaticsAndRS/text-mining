Doping Effects in Antiferromagnetic Domain Structures In this project we investigate the effects chemical doping has on the antiferromagnetic domain structures in hexagonal Manganites. In this project we investigate chemical doping effects on antiferromagnetic (AFM) domain structures in hexagonal Manganites. Using Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) we image the spatial AFM domain distribution and track doping-induced changes regarding shape and size.
