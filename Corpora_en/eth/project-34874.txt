Methane functionalization via catalytic oxybromination reaction The catalytic oxybromination reaction is an attractive route to functionalize methane under rather low temperatures and pressures. We have demonstrated new materials exhibiting exceptional oxybromination performance in terms of activity, stability and selectivity.
