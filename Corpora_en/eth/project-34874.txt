Methane functionalization via catalytic oxybromination reaction The catalytic oxybromination reaction is an attractive route to functionalize methane under rather low temperatures and pressures. We have demonstrated new materials exhibiting exceptional oxybromination performance in terms of activity, stability and selectivity. The increasing reserves of natural gas vitalize the idea of using methane as a key platform molecule for producing chemicals and fuels. Activation of its strong C-H bonds is nowadays achieved via capital-intensive syngas production (e.g. MTO and FT synthesis). This fact, along with the high costs of methane transportation, make this feedstock being underutilized. The chemical industry thus requires more advanced functionalization strategies of methane to successfully exploit this alternative. The oxybromination reaction is an attractive route. There, methane reacts with HBr and O2 to form methyl bromide and water under mild conditions. It integrates the methyl bromide formation, suitable for subsequent chemical transformations, with direct valorization of the HBr streams. Although some materials have been reported to catalyze this reaction, the development of active, selective and inexpensive catalysts that exhibit exceptional stability under corrosive conditions is still a key stone towards commercialization of this process. Herein, we investigate different materials, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the structure-activity relationships which would enable a rational catalyst design.
