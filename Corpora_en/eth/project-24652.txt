Gold catalyst shows interesting properties in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro compounds with high selectivity towards the nitro group in the presence of other reducible groups. By combining X-ray absorption techniques with infrared techniques we aim to relate the interaction between the structure of the catalyst and the catalytic performance. For that a self made in situ cell will be used to determine the structure-performance relationship under working conditions.
