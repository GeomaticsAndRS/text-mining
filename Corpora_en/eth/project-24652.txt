Determining the active sites in the hydrogenation of nitro benzene over Au/MeOx catalyts Gold catalyst shows interesting properties in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro compounds with high selectivity towards the nitro group in the presence of other reducible groups. By combining X-ray absorption techniques with infrared techniques we aim to relate the interaction between the ...
