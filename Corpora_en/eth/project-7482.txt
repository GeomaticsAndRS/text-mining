Spectroscopic and Isotopic Studies of Hydrothermal Solutions Ultraviolet and visible spectroscopic studies of ionisation and metal complex equilibria are being measured up to $450\dgand 1500 bar. These data are required to understand geochemical processes occurring in the earth's crust. Data on the first ionisation constant of hydrogen sulphide up to near the critical point of water has recently been obtained and these measurements will be extended to higher pressures. Studies of chloride complexing with copper(I), tin(II) and thallium(I) are also in progress. X-ray absorption (EXAFS) spectroscopic studies of high temperature aqueous solutions are also underway and have yielded information on the solvation of ions and ion pairing in hydrothermal fluids. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope fraction between hydration shell water and bulk solvent are also being measured in electrolyte solutions at high temperatures and pressures. These experiments are being complemented by molecular dynamic and ab initio calculations.
