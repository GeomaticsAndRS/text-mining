Quantum entanglement and convex optimization In collaboration with colleagues from the IQI at Caltech, we study computationally efficient solutions to the problem of recognizing and certifying when bipartite quantum states possess the entanglement property. Quantum entanglement and convex optimization: The techniques alluded to above, though originally motivated by the needs of the analysis of dynamical systems, have also found applications in areas (apparently) as distant as quantum information theory. In recent work, performed in collaboration with colleagues from the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech, we present a computationally efficient solution to a long-standing problem, that of recognizing and certifying when bipartite quantum states possess the entanglement property. Entanglement is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics, which cannot be reproduced by purely classical means, and that enables many surprising applications such as protocols for quantum computation and teleportation. The achievement of a satisfactory computational characterization of entangled states is beginning to open many promising research directions.
