Cattle grazing - an integral part of broadleaf forest management in Bhutan Cattle grazing in broadleaf forests in Bhutan is an age-long tradition forming an integral part of the farming system. The recent introduction of scientific forest management, with the emphasis on wood production, has paid little attention to grazing as it allegedly conflicts with sound forestry practices. With a view to integrating cattle grazing into broadleaf forest management planning, the cattle grazing situation in broadleaf forests was investigated. A forest inventory was carried out to evaluate the impact of grazing on ground vegetation, seedlings, saplings and trees. A socio-economic survey was undertaken to gain an insight into socio-economic conditions and to investigate the farmer's and herder's perception of broadleaf forest utilization and management. The two-level planning system should provide a framework to co-ordinate forest management objectives and activities, to resolve conflicts and to implement the forest plans among the various stakeholders, including local people. On the basis of three case studies with different intensities of cattle grazing a two-level forest planning system is proposed: the higher level co-ordinates the regional forest uses, whereas the lower level co-ordinates the local needs.
