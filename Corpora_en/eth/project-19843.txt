Zeeman deceleration of radicals Multistage Zeeman deceleration of atoms and molecules is developed as a means to generate samples of cold atoms and molecules at rest in the laboratory frame starting from supersonic jet expansions. Multistage Zeeman deceleration of atoms and molecules is developed as a means to generate samples of cold atoms and molecules at rest in the laboratory frame starting from supersonic jet expansions. Each stage in the decelerator consists of a solenoid through which high currents (up to 300 A) are pulsed, generating field strengths up to 1.5 Tesla. Atoms and molecules in low-field-seeking Zeeman components experience a force opposing their motion and are slowed down as they enter the solenoids. After deceleration the atoms and molecules are loaded in magnetic traps where high-resolution spectroscopic experiments are performed. Compared to high-resolution spectroscopic measurements on atoms and molecules in supersonic beams, these measurements have the advantage that the resolution is not limited by the transit time of the atoms or molecules through the radiation field. Once the atoms or molecules are trapped in three dimensions, the possibility of further cooling, e.g. evaporative cooling, will be examined.
