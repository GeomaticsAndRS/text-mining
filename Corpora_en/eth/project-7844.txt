Cascaded Second-Order Nonlinearities in Organic and Inorganic Single Crystals Large, nonresonant optical Kerr-like nonlinearities are a basic requirement for all-optical switching and related applications. Besides the nonlinearity which is proportional to chi$^{(3)}$there is another important contribution that only occurs in noncentrosymmetric materials. This contribution induces a nonlinear phase shift in nearly phase-matched second-harmonic generation interactions and other parametric processes. Such effects were first observed in high-power pulsed second-harmonic generation experiments. Recently the potential for all-optical switching was realized and large nonlinear phase shifts due to cascading were observed in different materials. We demonstrated that there exist other combined processes of second-order nonlinear optical effects that give rise to a large effective nonlinear refractive index n$_{2}$without the need of phase-matching. In particular, we have shown both theoretically and experimentally that the combined processes of optical rectification and the linear electro-optic effect lead to an effective n$_{2}$in noncentrosymmetric materials. We are now investigating the different possible schemes for this type of cascading and in order to compare the resulting third-order nonlinearities. Special emphasis is on the underlying physics and the potential of different suitable materials. A comparison with true chi$^{(3)}$ third-order nonlinearities is also planned.
