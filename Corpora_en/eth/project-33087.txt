Regularity properties and approximations for stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations with non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities A number of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations from the literature contain non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities in their drift or diffusion coefficients. The goal of this project is to analyze regularity and approximation properties of such equations. A number of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations from the literature (such as, for example, the Heston and the 3/2-model from financial engineering, (overdamped) Langevintype equations from molecular dynamics, stochastic spatially extended FitzHugh-Nagumo systems from neurobiology, stochastic Navier-Stokes equations, Cahn-Hilliard-Cook equations) contain non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities in their drift or diffusion coefficients. A central aim of this project is to investigate regularity properties with respect to the initial values of such stochastic differential equations in a systematic way. A further goal of this project is to analyze the regularity of solutions of the deterministic Kolmogorov partial dfferential equations associated to such stochastic differential equations. Another core aim of this project is to analyze weak and strong convergence and convergence rates of numerical approximations for such stochastic differential equations.
