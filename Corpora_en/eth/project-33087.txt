Regularity properties and approximations for stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations with non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities A number of stochastic ordinary and partial differential equations from the literature contain non-globally Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities in their drift or diffusion coefficients. The goal of this project is to analyze regularity and approximation properties of such equations.
