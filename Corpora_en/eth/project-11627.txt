Scaling and industrial design of a new high shear seed crystallization process The generation of tailored polymorh crystals in food fat systems is carried out in high shear fields under high local temperature gradients. The kinetics for nucleation, crystal growth and polymorh transformation under acting shear forces is studied and scaling laws for an industrial device are deri
