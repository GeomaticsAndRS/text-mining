External Polychromy of Historic Monuments An examination of external polychromy and mural painting, predominantly on monuments of plastered stone construction, from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. It includes painted decorations, figures and images, illusionistic stonework, and painted parts of buildings. The goal is a systematic compilation of the historical and geographical variety of appearance of these paintings, with representative examples from Switzerland. It will include visual and material findings, manual production techniques, an art-historical assessment, an iconological confrontation with contemporary artwork and an examination of their place in the historical development of art. Plaster decoration is excluded, for the most part, as it is the subject of a separate inquiry (see: Plaster on Historic Monments). The material will be published as a thematically organized catalog.
