Large-scale Adaptive Sensing, Learning and Decision Making: Theory and Applications (SCADAPT) How can one act effectively while facing a deluge of data? We seek to advance large-scale adaptive decision making under uncertainty, by grounding it in the novel computational framework of adaptive submodular optimization. We develop novel algorithms and apply them in several challenging domains.
