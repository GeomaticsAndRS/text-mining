Comparing Climate Change Policy Networks: Case Study Switzerland Swiss case study to the international research project Comparing Climate Change Policy Networks (COMPON) which aims to find broad principles to explain cross-national variation in the success and failure at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to foster the diffusion of innovative climate policies. According to a wide scientific consensus, global climate change threatens all nations of the world with increasing risk of severe disasters. Reducing these risks requires the rapid decline (mitigation) of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the global atmosphere. In addition to the international climate change policy processes within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), individual nations, societies and sub-national jurisdictions have started to formulate and implement their climate change mitigation policies. Some nations have made little progress in reducing or stabilizing their GHG emissions, while others have steadily improved. This global situation constitutes a natural experiment of climate change policymaking. The COMPON project investigates such policy processes in currently 19 nations and societies as well as the international level. In each case, the teams use identical methods to collect three types of data: media content analysis (newspapers and legislative reports); in-depth interviews; and quantitative network survey of organizations engaged in the mitigation issue.
