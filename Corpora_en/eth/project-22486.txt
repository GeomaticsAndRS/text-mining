Population genetic analysis of Mycosphaerella graminicola effectors on wheat and wild grasses and correlated changes in pathogenicity This study will analyze and compare several M. graminicola cell wall- degrading enzymes. Wheat- and wild grasses derived populations will be examined to study the variation and the putative relationship between sequence haplotypes and enzyme activity that might alter the fungal pathogenicity.
