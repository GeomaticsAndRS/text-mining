Forest Planning Based on Sustained Forestry Under the changing conditions in forestry, the traditional term of sustainability also changed its meaning. Suitable regulation cycles for the design of forest development were established for every single forest function. The general concepts of sustainability were realised through specific standards. Starting out from the realisation of the preexisting principles of sustainability, the planning process of designing a sustained system was presented by the implementation of system theory. The integration into the new Swiss forest planning concept and into its methodological approach, in particular, was elaborated within a case study.
