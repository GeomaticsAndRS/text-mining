Corporate carbon-intensity and firm valuation: The effect of regulatory pressure This paper investigates whether overall firm level carbon intensity is related to financial performance as measured by TobinsS Q. I estimate firm valuation models for two regions with well developed stock markets and distinct federal carbon emission policies. This paper investigates whether carbon intensity of firms is related to financial performance as measured by TobinsS Q. The carbon intensity of publicly listed firms is assessed at the overall firm level. I distinguish between two potential costs related to corporate carbon emissions, inherent and regulatory costs. While regulatory costs are related to regulatory interventions or risks related to future government interventions, inherent costs are driven by the development of input prices. The existence of these two sources of costs is addressed by means of a dynamic panel framework. I estimate firm valuation models for two regions with well developed stock markets that are distinct with respect to federal carbon emission policies, namely the United States and the United Kingdom. There is evidence for a negative relationship between carbon intensity and TobinSs Q in both markets, however twice as large in the United Kingdom. Put differently, an increase in carbon intensity has about twice the penalty in terms of Q in the United Kingdom and vice versa, a decrease twice the reward. The results highlight the role of regulatory pressure for markets to reward climate friendly behavior and suggest that rapidly rising input prices, as observed during the period analyzed, help steer markets towards greener behavior.
