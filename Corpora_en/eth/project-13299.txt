Gutknecht, M.: Block Krylov Space Methods for Indefinite Hermitian Linear Systems Block versions for large sparse Hermitian indefinite linear systems with multiple right-hand sides of the MINRES and SYMMLQ algorithms are proposed and investigated, in particular with respect to deflation and loss of orthogonality. Two of the standard sparse linear solvers for indefinite Hermitian linear systems are the two closely related algorithms MINRES and SYMMLQ introduced by Paige and Saunders (1975). A formal generalization of these to block methods for systems with multiple right-hand sides is quite straightforward. However, the possibility of intersecting Krylov subspaces (that is, linear dependence of basis vectors for Krylov subspaces with different starting vectors, but the same matrix) can cause also for these Krylov space methods serious difficulties. In the diploma thesis (at ETH Zurich) of Thomas Schmelzer a breakthrough in the understanding of the effects of deflation in the symmetric block Lanczos process was achieved: the devastating effect of ignoring deflation is not the (very unlikely) breakdown of the QR decomposition of the generated block tridiagonal (or banded) matrix needed in MINRES and SYMMLQ, but the complete loss of orthogonality of the basis created. This loss has then a strong effect on the convergence of block MINRES and SYMMLQ. The situation is different for block GMRES and ordinary GMRES and MINRES.
