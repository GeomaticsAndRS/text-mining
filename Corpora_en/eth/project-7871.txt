Low Cost Packaging of Semiconductor Laser Arrays Modules for Data Communication Applications The packaging of optoelectronic devices for optical telecommunication and parallel interconnects largely dominates the costs of these modules. This is mainly due to the incompatibility with electronic packaging and the high geometrical precision requirements at the fiber-chip interface. Self-alignment techniques help to reduce packaging time and costs drastically. Based on the passive self-aligned packaging technique on a Si motherboard described before we realized semiconductor laser array modules. Etched alignment trenches on the 980nm laser array chips from IBM Zurich Research Lab fit into alignment mesas on the Si board that are simultaneously etched with the V-grooves carrying the optical fibers and providing the self-alignment between laser centre and fiber core. A second advantage of this alignment technique is the self-positioning effect of the side wall slope, which guides the fibers and the chip from a relatively loose initial position to its precise end-position. For an insertion depth of 7\gmm of the laser chip, the opening in the silicon is 5\gmm larger on both sides, which relieves the required precision for the placing tool. Au electroplated transmission lines provide the laser connection and In solder areas electrical contact, fixation and heat dissipation of the upside down mounted lasers. 4, 8 and 12 channel laser modules have been flip-chip packaged with cleaved and lensed multi mode fibers achieving coupling losses of 3.4\pm0.2 and 1.3\pm0.2 dB, respectively. The mounting excess loss for all channels is <0.3 dB.
