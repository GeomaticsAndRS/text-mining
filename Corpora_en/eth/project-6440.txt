Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids in higher plants The biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, i.e. compounds containing a benzene ring, is restricted to bacteria, fungi, and plants. The major pathway for the biosynthesis of such compounds is the shikimate pathway. As little is known about the enzymes of this pathway in plants, we have initiated a long term project designed to clone the respective cDNAs and genes, to study the expression of the latter under various physiological conditions, and to express some of the cDNAs in heterologous systems in order to gain access to the respective proteins. The complete set of cDNAs coding for the enzymes catalyzing the first seven enzymatic steps in the biosynthetic chain (prechorismate pathway) is now available. Without exception, these cDNAs encode precursor proteins with transit peptides directing them to the plastidic compartment. However, in the case of chorismate mutase (CM), the first enzyme of that branch of the shikimate pathway that leads to the synthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine, cDNAs and genes have been cloned which encode a plastidic and cytosolic isozyme, respectively. In search for their function, we are using the antisense expression strategy in transgenic plants. Furthermore, we have constructed plants in which the expression of b-glucuronidase (GUS) is directed by the respective CM promoter. Lately, we have initiated a systematic approach to the search for the enzymes catalyzing the final steps in phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis starting from prephenate, using a combination of biochemical and molecular biological techniques.
