The vesicle-trafficking protein munc18b increases the secretory capacity of mammalian cells Heterologous protein production in mammalian cells is often challenged by the bottleneck of the secretory machinery, which prevents producer cells from fully exploiting their physiologic capacity in the production of biopharmaceuticals. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanism
