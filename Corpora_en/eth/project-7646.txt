Experimental Studies on Gravitationally Vibrating Systems We are attempting to measure the gravitational interaction between two vibratingbodies. The first goal is the design and implementation of an experiment to detectgravitationally induced vibrations. The second goal is the measurement of the phasespeed of gravity in the near field of a gravitational transmitter. Since the force ofgravity is weak, the induced motion in the receiver is very small. To increase thevibrational amplitude of the receiver, a resonant damped spring-mass system is used.Mathematical analysis of a mass transmitter vibrating near a dampedmass-springsystem indicates that the amplitude of the vibration induced in the receiver massis maximised for low transmitter frequency, short distance between the transmitterand receiver, high quality factor of the receiver, and high transmitter mass. If gravitypropagates at a finite speed, then the phase of the induced vibration will depend on thedistance between the transmitter and receiver. From the observed phase change, onecan determine the speed of gravity.
