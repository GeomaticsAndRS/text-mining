Computer Algebra Our group is interested in several aspects of computer algebra, with an emphasis on realizable and practical algorithms and their implementation. The main areas of research have been in: algorithms for the computation of limits, solution of systems of polynomial equations, transformations of equations or systems of general equations into systems of polynomial equations, factoring of multivariate polynomials and algebraic simplification. All these algorithms are designed to perform these operations symbolically, not just numerically. Most of our successful implementations of these algorithms are incorporated in the Maple system. Our group is also active in the systems and intercommunications area, having founded and run the Open Math Group and its two first meetings (now an EC funded project). Study of system design, user interfaces and models of user interaction with Computer Algebra Systems are also conducted.
