Uncertainty quantification techniques in the context of imprecise/mixed probability modelling Uncertainty quantification techniques are developed in the context of imprecise/mixed probability (aleatory and epistemic) and applied for solving uncertainty propagation problems (e.g. structural reliability and robust design optimization).
