Uncertainty quantification techniques in the context of imprecise/mixed probability modelling Uncertainty quantification techniques are developed in the context of imprecise/mixed probability (aleatory and epistemic) and applied for solving uncertainty propagation problems (e.g. structural reliability and robust design optimization). Imprecise probabilities is a vague formulation of many attempts to describe the mix of different sources of uncertainty (Helton and Oberkampf, 2004). The commonly known source is the aleatory uncertainty which describes the natural variability of a parameter. A second source is the so-called epistemic uncertainty which originates from the lack of knowledge, respectively the lack of precision on data. Both types of uncertainties are inherent in modelling natural processes which requires the consideration of imprecise probabilities e.g. for reliability analysis. Commonly, only the aleatory uncertainty is considered due to computational limitations. With the growing computational power and more advanced uncertainty propagation techniques (Sudret, 2012), imprecise probabilities can be handled in realistic settings. This project will connect the concept of imprecise probabilities and recent advances in uncertainty propagation. New approaches such as polynomial exansions and Kriging will be explored taking advantage of recent developments in high performance computing. Helton, J. and W. Oberkampf (2004, July).
