Robustheit von Skelettbauten aus Stahlbeton / Robustness of Reinforced Concrete Flat Slab Structures Robustness of structures is a research field which has been treated by scientists since the 1970s. Whereby the intensity of the research work increased after every fatal failure, i. e. Ronan Point (1968), Oklahoma City (1995), World Trade Center (2001). The results of these works are manifold. They vary from recommendations for the structural concept and detailing to assumptions for abnormal actions and analysis methods. Some of these recommendations and assumptions have been included in recent design codes, but most of them are quite general and hence not often used in the everyday work of a structural engineer. The structural engineer has little information about the robustness of his designed structure or about methods to analyse it. This gap will be closed exemplarily by an investigation of column failure in widespread flat slab structures made of reinforced concrete. Firstly, the basics of flat slab structures, robustness, abnormal actions and nonlinear structural member resistance are being investigated, as far as necessary to be applied in a structural analysis. Thus the objectives are to find out which are the typical geometries for flat slab structures, which methods are useful to provide robustness, how a column failure can be analysed as a hazard scenario and how the structural resistance can be calculated with an adequate effort. Secondly, these examined basics will be applied on the structural analysis of existing structures. This step has the aim to ascertain whether normal flat slab structures can even resist a column failure or how they can be designed for this hazard scenario as well. Thirdly, guidelines will be written to enable structural engineers to analyse the robustness of their structures, to improve it if necessary and to assess the architectural as well as the financial consequences conditioned by these measures.
