Multivariate Extremes in Quantitative Risk Management In order to work out stress scenarios in QRM, methods are developped to describe extreme (market) risk scenarios. The resulting theory belongs to the realm of Extreme Value Theory, in particular a multivariate version of EVT. Often, large (i.e. catastrophic) claims in non-life insurance are caused by a combination of various factors, especially by coinciding large values of these. The necessary mathematical theory for describing such events is multivariate extreme value theory. In this project, the use of the latter theory in the context of reinsurance treaties is investigated (pre 2002). At a further stage (from 2002) the project concentrates on the development of a probabilistic/geometric theory of extreme risk scenarios based on a version of multivariate extreme value theory. Various applications to Quantitative Risk Management for the financial industry will be investigated.
