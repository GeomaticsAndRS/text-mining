Interdisciplinary molecular and isotopic perspectives on tropical climate and ecosystem change since the last glacial period Tropical regions are projected to suffer sharp declines in water availability relative to demand over the next century as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Within these regions, both the variability and absolute scarcity of water resources have major impacts on ecological and sociological patterns. Yet, the mechanisms underlying abrupt climate shifts in the tropics remain uncertain. We introduce a multiple-proxy analytical strategy that will develop new, high-resolution records of tropical Atlantic Ocean sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) and African precipitation and vegetation since the last glacial period, about 20 thousand years ago. Modern and historical climate data indicate a robust coupling between tropical Atlantic Ocean SSTs and NW African climate over annual timescales. Building on this foundation, we propose to explore the nature of ocean-atmosphereecosystem linkages over longer, centennial-to-millennial timescales. In particular, we will generate comprehensive molecular and isotopic proxy records using the molecular remains of ancient ´ or SbiomarkersS preserved in sediments from the tropical Atlantic plants and microorganisms U U Ocean. Preliminary analyses indicate these sediments have high-accumulation rates and contain abundant terrestrial and marine biomarkers, which will allow us to generate decadal-resolution records of coupled terrestrial and oceanic conditions. We anticipate a key scientific contribution of this project will be to constrain the pace, phase and magnitude of tropical climate changes during a period associated with key transitions in human culture.
