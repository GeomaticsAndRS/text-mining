Damage and swelling of anhydrite clay rocks Swelling of anhydrite induces major problems in tunneling. In this project we study the formation of extensional fractures created by high deviatoric stress, the increase in hydraulic conductivity, the mineral transformations along the groundwater pathways and the induced localized swelling process.
