Oscillating Thin Film Cooling Systems: Single Layer Performance Optimization of the Concept and its Extension to Multiple Layers A novel thin film cooling approach integrates a radially oscillating fluid flow in the base of a heat sink. First objective is to develop a general understanding of the heat transfer of that flow field to an array of pins. Second objective is the extension to stacked packages and chips.
