Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) in Civil Engineering Partially observable Markov decision processes describe a method to determine optimal decision strategies under uncertainty and estimate the expected cost resulting out of the optimal strategy. Here an implementation orie ted towards Civil Engineering practice is examined. Partially observable Markov decision processes describe a method to determine optimal decision strategies under uncertainty and estimate the expected cost resulting out of the optimal strategy. It is a generalization of the (fully observable) Markov decision process (MDP) which doesnSt account for any uncertainty. POMDPs have been applied in various fields in science and engineering like navigation, teaching strategies, and optimal planning of maintenance. So far, the most significant applications are found are found in the field of robotics [1]. The goal is to find the optimal behavior for an agent in an environment which is not fully sensible for the agentSs sensors. In civil engineering only few attempts have been done so far toward utilizing POMDPs [2] despite the methods promising capabilities. On one hand, this method can be used to determine optimal maintenance strategies for existing structures and facilities. This task is essential for reducing the truly sizeable maintenance costs. On the other hand, this method can be a suitable tool for localization of damage in complex structures.
