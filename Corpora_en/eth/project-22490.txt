Demographic structure, reproduction and genetic diversity of coco de mer Lodoicea maldivica in three populations We assess the demographic structure, the reproductive mechanisms, and the genetic diversity within and between populations of coco de mer to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of the species. The monospecific coco de mer Lodoicea maldivica, endemic to the Seychelles, is one of the worldSs rarest and most intriguing palms. Its natural distribution is confined to two islands of the archipelago. The largest population occurs on the island of Praslin where approximately 6000 individuals co-occur with five endemic palms in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Vallée de Mai. On the neighbouring island of Curieuse, there are also a few scattered coco de mers. The coco de mer is an iconic flagship species of the Seychelles and a major tourist attraction for the Vallée de Mai. The species derived its special status in part from the many legends created around the shape and the size of the seeds but more so due to its uniqueness in the plant kingdom. Lodoicea is a plant of extremes; the leaves, especially those of juveniles, are among the largest ever recorded, adult trees only attain maturity after 30 years, and the nuts are the largest and heaviest in the world. Most of these nuts are collected and sold to tourists contributing substantially to the economy of the Seychelles. Given the scientific, cultural, economic and conservation importance of the coco de mer, it is somewhat surprising that basic information on the demography, reproductive ecology and genetic diversity of the species is lacking. Its limited and fragmented distribution makes it vital to understand its reproductive mechanisms to secure long-term viability of the species.
