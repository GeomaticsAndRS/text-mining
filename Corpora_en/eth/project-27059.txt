Drought-RSPI Drought is natural hazard that has hit Europe hard over the last decades. Likely it will become more frequent and more severe due to the increased likelihood of warmer Northern winters and hotter Mediterranean summers. There is an urgent need to improve drought preparedness through increased knowledge, drought management plans and an improved science-policy interfacing that will reduce vulnerability to future drought and the risks they pose for Europe. The EU-FP7 DroughtR&SPI project will address this pressing need. Drought-R&SPI will deliver the following: - enhanced knowledge of past droughts (underlying processes, frequencies, severities and scales), in particular driving atmospheric factors and characteristics of the most extreme historic events at the pan-European scale - in-depth understanding of environmental and socio-economic impacts at a small scale in waterstressed regions (case studies) and considering the large-scale drivers - past responses to drought events at the case study scale, and identify best practice examples and lessons learnt crucial for the development of drought management planning - suite of drought indicators that integrate physical, impact and vulnerability indices, addressing different spatio-temporal scales and water-related sectors - innovative methodology for early warning (monitoring and forecasting) of drought at the panEuropean scale - drought dialogue fora (DDF's) at different scales for science-policy interfacing - drought hazard and potential vulnerabilities at the case study and pan-European scale in the 21st century to identify drought sensitive sectors and regions - web-based information and knowledge exchange and sharing facilitated by the European Drought Centre (EDC)
