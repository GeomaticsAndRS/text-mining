Shape and size control in the preparation of catalytic particles for Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization Identify key factors in the particles formation and growth process and develop strategies to improve their preparation. A feature of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst type is that during the polymerization reaction, the catalyst particles grow by a process of replication, such that the particle size distribution and shape of the catalyst is reflected in those of the polyethylene particles, which in turn determine the flow ability and quality of the final polymer powder. The topic of this project is the preparation of catalytic particles for Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization and is carried out in collaboration with the industry. The catalytic particle under investigation is a MgCl2-supported TiCl3 type catalyst and is currently applied on industrial scale in a slurry process to produce bi-modal HDPE. In the frame of this project, the ultimate goal will be to identify key factors influencing the particle size distribution, with special focus on the aggregation processes. The methods to monitor this process will be focused beam reflectance measurement (FBRM) and light scattering techniques (SASLS), as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
