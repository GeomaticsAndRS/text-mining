The Prism Interpretation of Multi-Leg Mach-Zehnder Switches The principle of Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZI) has been used by various groups in integrated 2x2 optical switches, where two single-mode input waveguides are actively routed to two singlemode outputs. They contain two phase modulators placed between a 3dB power splitter and a 3dB power combiner, where mode interference occurs. We generalized the concept of the MZI switch and investigated active MxN multi-leg MZIs (M = 1, 2, N). In these devices a phase shifting section containing N phase modulators is placed between a MxN and a NxN multi-mode interference coupler (MMI) used as passive power splitter and combiner. The driving conditions of such multi-leg MZIs have been analyzed. The required phase shifts for multi-leg MZI have been calculated. We showed that the complexity is only apparent and can be avoided just by introducing a new natural numbering of the waveguides. The reason for this new numbering is related to basic properties of MMI-couplers. Using the natural numbering, the multi-leg MZI's can be interpreted as integrated prisms in the same way as for the standard waveguide grating multiplexers. This easy analogy helps the general discussion of active and passive 1xN multi-leg MZI's. For wavelength filtering applications, a new design of the phased waveguide array is proposed that improves the spectral response characteristics of the multi-leg MZI as wavelength filter. The interpretation of the transmission curves are facilitated by using the integrated prism interpretation. This work has been published in: Optical an Quantum Electronics 27 (1995) 909-920).
