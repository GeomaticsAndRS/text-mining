Assessment and Further Development of Barriers Composed of Asphalt Concrete andMineral Barrier Material for Landfills for the Depositing of Waste and Residues The common use in Germany of barrier systems composed of a mineral sealing component with low porosity and a plastic sheet with no pores has certain limits. Slope stability problems may occur due to the surface properties of the plastic sheets and the mechanical properties of the deposited materials. Before and after barrier placement, such systems are sensitive to mechanical damage and weathering phenomena. In addition, correct placement of plastic sheets depends on good contact between the sheets and the mineral material, and the high requirements placed on the sewing of joints. Such demands result in high placement costs and extra checking during construction. A combination barrier made of an asphalt covering layer and a mineral bearing layer uses the advantages of both systems, i.e., on the one hand, the high resistance of asphalt concrete to mechanical sollicitations available immediately following placement, its absolute watertightness and good stability, even for steep slopes (1:1.7) and, on the other hand, contaminant retention capabilities from clayey materials. The object of the research is the assessment of the functional security of this new barrier system, with special investigation of the interface surface of the system components. The following problems will also be studied: - Determination of friction values on the interface surface - Influence of the placement temperature of the asphalt concrete on the geotechnical properties of the mineral bearing layer at the interface surface - Writing of recommendations for the placement as a function of the material properties (shear strength, stiffness modulus)
