Oceanic nitrogen cycle during the last glacial/interglacial period The marine nitrogen cycle is investigated during the last glacial/interglacial period with a special focus on denitrification and nitrogen fixation and their role in controlling the total amount of fixed nitrogen in the ocean, i.e. their role in controlling biological productivity in the ocean.
