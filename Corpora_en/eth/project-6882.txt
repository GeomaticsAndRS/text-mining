High Rydberg states: Spectroscopic and dynamical studies The spectroscopic and dynamical properties of highly excited molecular Rydberg states are not as well characterized as those of lower lying, more easily accessible electronic states. What renders these states a particularly interesting subject of study is the weakly bound nature of the Rydberg electron which causes molecules in high Rydberg states to be very sensitive to their environment and, at the same time, to be very insensitive to internal decay processes such as autoionization or predissociation. High resolution vacuum ultraviolet-millimetre wave double resonance spectroscopy is developed as a means to obtain detailed information on high molecular Rydberg states. Special attention is given to (1) the response of these states to pulsed and continuous electric fields, (2) the competition between internal decay mechanisms such as autoionization and predissociation, (3) the effect of external fields on internal decay mechanisms, (4) the determination of the stability of these states under a variety of experimental conditions. The high spectral resolution we have achieved in recent years enables us to study the role of nuclear spins in photoionization and in the energy level structure of high Rydberg states.
