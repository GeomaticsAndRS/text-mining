Simulation of strongly correlated fermion systems In strongly correlated quantum systems the normal semi-classical behavior of metals, semi-conductors, magnets or insulators breaks down due to large quantum fluctuations and new phases with exotic properties emerge. Examples are topological order, orbital currents or high temperature superconductivity. While in non-frustrated magnetic and bosonic systems quantum Monte Carlo simulations allow the accurate simulation of all properties (see the project on quantum phase transitions), in fermionic and in frustrated systems, these powerful techniques cannot be used. There we use other techniques, such as exact diagonalization, series expansions, or the density matrix renormalization group technique to investigate small systems. We compare our unbiased and accurate numerical results to predictions from approximate analytical theories, and try to find mappings to bosonic systems which can then be investigated accurately. Recently, we started sampling Feynman's diagrammatic series with different Monte Carlo methods. The results of this approach are immediately valid in the thermodynamic limit and for specific problems such as the BCS-BEC crossover in the attractive Hubbard model we could devise new sign-problem free continuous-time algorithms.
