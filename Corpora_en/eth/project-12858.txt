Hyperfine Decoupling schemes for nuclei with spin I>1/2 Hyperfine decoupling experiments provide a new class of experiments for resolution enhancement and simplification of complicated ESEEM spectra. The theoretical description of hyperfine decoupling is extended to the case of I=1 nuclei. The aim of this study is the development of new pulse sequences that will correlate the ESEEM frequencies containing the hyperfine interaction, with the decoupled frequencies containing only nuclear Zeeman and quadrupole interactions. It is expected that the implementation of new experiments will allow for a direct determination of nuclear quadrupole parameters from ESEEM-based techniques. Its efficiency will be tested by numerical simulations and applications to different orientationally disordered systems containing nuclei with I>1.
