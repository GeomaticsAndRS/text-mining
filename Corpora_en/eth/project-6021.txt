Semiconductive Properties of Passive Films The corrosion behaviour of many important construction materials such as stainless steels is due to the formation of a thin, protective oxide layer (passive film) on the surface of the materials. For the corrosion reaction, not only the ion flux, but also the electron transport properties through this passive film can be rate determining. Hence, it is of great interest to obtain information about the electronic properties of passive films. In the present project therefore the semiconductive properties of passive films on various metals and alloys (e.g. Fe, Cr, Ni, Fe-Cr alloys, stainless steels, Cu and Cu base alloys) were studied by photoelectrochemical methods and capacitance measurements. Due to the small thickness and in most cases high defectiveness of the passive films, these systems cannot be considered as ideal semiconductors. Therefore concepts for the interpretation of the results had to be evaluated. It was a special aim to find correlations between the electronic properties of the passive films and the corrosion behavior. Further, illumination effects on the properties of passive film on iron were investigated.
