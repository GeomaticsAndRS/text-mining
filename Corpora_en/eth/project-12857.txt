Nanoscale Distance Measurements by Pulse EPR The structure determination of molecular assemblies with little or no long-range order is a major problem of nanoscale science. For many disordered systems in molecular biology (e.g. many transmembrane proteins) or in materials science structural elucidation through x-ray crystallography is severely hampered. Pulse EPR techniques, such as Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) have opened possibilities to measure distances between radicals in solids in the range of approximately 1.5-8 nm. This is done by measuring of the dipolar coupling between two electron spins. We are currently investigating modifications of and alternatives to the established methods in order to expand the applicability and the information content. Some of the goals include: - Applicability of distance measurement schemes to transition metal centres, - Extension of the measurable distance range to electron separations shorter than 1.5 nm and larger than 8 nm, - Extraction of information on the mutual spin-spin orientation.
