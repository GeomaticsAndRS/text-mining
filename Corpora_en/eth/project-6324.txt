New Decisive Structures of Integrated Technology ManagementConcept of T-Bell-Groupäs a Guide to Master the Technological Change 

 Technologically intensive company's competitiveness is largely dependant on the ability of making reliable technological decisions. In our opinion, to master this difficult general aspect of technological change, three demanding deciding tasks stand in the forefront with equal importance, namely: First, the choice of technology for designing the products and processes due to its diversity becomes a challenge. Second, the trend of  make or buy" - deviating from exclusive individual development of the chosen technology to intensively exploring an external source. Finally, of accelerating significance is to regard technology as an individual processing source. In other words, to examine the odds of keep or sell - whether to retain the technology for internal use of products and processes or to market it. Within the frame of integrated technology management the significance of this trilogy of decision-making is reflected by matching the current organizational structure. Traditional structures visualize the fulfillment of these tasks in an isolated approach. In the opinion of the authors the scope of the technology change can only be accomplished and mastered if the three tasks are inter-supportive and represent a coherent unanimous decision. The project suggests and lays the foundation towards this direction with the so called T-Bell-Group.
