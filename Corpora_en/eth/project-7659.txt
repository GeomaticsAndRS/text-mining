Nondestructive Evaluation of Defects using Structural Wave Propagation To ensure the safety and reliability of a component in any mechanicaldevice, the number, size and distribution of faults must be tested. If thestructure is thin in one or two directions, i.e. if it is a rod, plate,shell, etc., the application of structural wave propagation is anadditional method of quantitative non-destructive testing and evaluation.In contrast to classical ultrasonic testing, the wavelength in ourexperiments is large compared to the characteristic dimension of thestructure, i.e. the diameter of the rod or the thickness of the plate orshell.In this project the behavior of structural waves at various defects instructures is considered. Models based on continuum and fracture mechanicsare developed and then checked experimentally. The amplitude, phase,arrival time, etc. of the waves which are reflected or transmitted at adefect are theoretically predicted and compared to experimental results.The agreement for simple defects (lateral cracks in beams, circular defectsin plates) is excellent.
