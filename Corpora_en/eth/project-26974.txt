Switching mechanism of toroidal moment By mean of first-principles calculations, we explore the possible micros- copic mechanisms of the experimentally observed switch of the toroidal moment in lithium orthophosphates LiMPO4 (M = Ni, Co and Fe). Switching experiments in toroidal fields will complement the investigation.
