Functional cross-kingdom conservation of mammalian and moss (Physcomitrella patens) transcription, translation and secretion machineries Plants and mammals are separated by a huge evolutionary distance. Consequently, biotechnology and genetics have traditionally been divided into ’green’ and ’red’. Here, we provide comprehensive evidence that key components of the mammalian transcription, translation and secretion machineries are ...
