Computer Science for Teachers We work on methods for teaching computer science and the use of educational technology; we develop teaching materials for introductory computer science taught at various levels. Sponsored by the Foundation Schweizer Jugend Forscht , we organize a summer school on computing for highschool students. We consulted for various schools and the development of the educational requirements of two new officially designated computer professions ("Informatiker", Geräteinformatiker ). A joint program with the Institute of Information Systems helps Swiss schools gain access to the Internet. It consists of documentation, pilot-projects, an educational Worldwide-Web-Server (EducETH) and presentations to teachers. EducETH is a WWW-based Education Server designed for use in schools. It provides a WWW interface for preview and exchange of educational materials. EducETH, as an educational server for Swiss schools, is the electronic publication medium for the new collection of Physics Exercises for Swiss preuniversity schools.
