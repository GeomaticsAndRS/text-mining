Influence of stratospheric intrusions on surface ozone Lagrangian techniques are used to identify events of deep stratospheric intrusions down to the surface. Measurements from surface ozone stations in the US are then used to validate the Lagrangian results and to quantify the role of stratospheric intrusions for enhanced peaks in surface ozone.
