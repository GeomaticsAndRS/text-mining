NMR Investigations of Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour in Metals We have recently started our NMR investigation on U$_{0.2}$Y$_{0.8}$Pd$_{3}$, searching for evidence of non-Fermi-liquid behaviour in metals at low temperatures. Below 5 K this compound displays thermodynamic and transport properties which cannot be reconciled with the simple behaviour of Fermi liquids. The peculiar behaviour of this material has previously lead to suggestions that its ground state may be described by a model based on the quadrupolar Kondo effect or, alternatively, by assuming a magnetic phase transition at T = 0 K. We have started our investigation of this material using a sample well characterised by thermodynamic and transport properties. At a temperature of 0.2 K we have measured $^{89} and $^{105}NMR spectra, by varying stepwise the field at a fixed frequency of 14.112 MHz. The NMR linewidths corresponding to Y and Pd are 650 and 300 G respectively, and the corresponding Knight shifts are 0.15% and 0.38%. Comparing our results with reported $^{89}NMR measurements above 1.5 K we conclude that there is a very small change of the NMR spectra, below 1.5 K. There are drastic changes of the temperature dependence of the specific heat at temperatures near or below 0.5 K, however. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements in this temperature range are difficult, because of the very small NMR sensitivity of $^{89}and $^{105}nuclei. Therefore our present efforts aim principally at improving the signal to noise ratio.
