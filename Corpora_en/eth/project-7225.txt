Adaptive Multicarrier Access System (ADAMAS) The main objective of the project is to study, implement and validate a novel adaptive OFDM Point-to-MultiPoint (P-MP) outdoor broadband fixed wireless access system. The adaptivity will reside both in the physical layer, employing adaptive modulation schemes, as well as in the DLC layer employing dynamic allocation schemes in an effort to increase the usable bit rates. In technical terms, the maximization of the usable bit rate maintaining a given bit error rate at the highest possible frequency is the target of this work. The bit rate will vary from 64 Kbits/s up to 25 Mbit/s with respect to the channel conditions or the traffic requirements. Two scenarios will be tackled: a licensed and an unlicensed one. The licensed scenario will be located at a carrier frequency of 10.5 GHz. The other scenario is the unlicensed one in the 5.8 GHz frequency band (5.725-5.825 GHz). In both scenarios, the service symmetry will be varied from full broadcasting scenario (where the uplink does not exist at all) up to a symmetric scenario (equal uplink and downlink period). Both scenarios will use DTDMA/TDD in order to obtain a cost reduction and efficient utilization of frequencies.
