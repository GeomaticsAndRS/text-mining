Swiss Efforts in the Field of Peacebuilding This research project deals with how Switzerland has adapted its conceptions of peacebuilding to the changes of the international environment over the last decade and how it implemented these adaptations on the level of its activities in this field. Since the end of the Cold War, the spectrum of risks has widened, and the forms of conflicts have changed. The number of intra-state wars has risen, but such conflicts still have a strong impact across national borders. As a consequence, peacebuilding has gained in importance for the international community. In Switzerland also, peacebuilding has attracted greater attention in the past decade. Peacebuilding has been addressed as very important in both the Swiss governmentSs white papers on foreign policy and in the report on SwitzerlandSs security policy. The military side of contributions to peace support operations has been discussed widely in public in connection with Swiss participation in the work of the international community in Kosovo and in the referendum on armed participation in peace support operations. Swiss efforts to promote peace and stability through civilian means, however, tend to be neglected in this debate. This research project looks at how Switzerland has adapted its conceptions of peacebuilding to changes in the international environment over the past decade and how it has implemented these adaptations in its peacebuilding activities. The growing number of actors involved in conflict prevention (international organizations, states, NGOs), the increasing importance of new concepts like human security, the difficulty of reaching coherence among different fields of politics, and the definition of specific areas of interest and possible opportunities for Swiss foreign policy are just some of the factors that deserve closer examination.
