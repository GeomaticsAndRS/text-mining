Decentralised urine treatment with the nitritation/anammox process (DUNOX) Nitritation/anammox is an energy-efficient and reliable process for nitrogen removal from urine. A comparison of different reactors and an investigation of possible problems such as production of harmful gases or inhibition by organic substances will help to further optimise the process operation.
