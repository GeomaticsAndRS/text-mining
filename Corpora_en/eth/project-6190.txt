Numerical Simulation of Sheet Metal Forming Processes The program AutoForm for the numerical simulation of sheet metal forming processes was developed within the framework of a close cooperation with the Institute of Forming Technology of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich. The program can be applied to different practical industrial problems, e.g. in the car industry, where the bodywork and other parts of a car's frame are made of sheet metal formed by means of cold pressing processes. The geometry of the forming tools (die, matrix and blankholders), which can be very complicated, is specified by numerical data obtained from standard CAD programs. Initially, the sheet is uniformly discretised into triangular finite elements using a simple mesh generator. Then, during the forming process which is subdivided into time steps, parts of the mesh are adaptively refined. In a typical case, an initial mesh of some 1000 elements would be refined so as to result in a final mesh with over 50000 elements. A new algorithm has been developed in which the main membrane effects have been decoupled from the secondary bending effects. One demanding problem that had to be solved numerically was to determine the contact points between the forming tools and the sheet metal as well as the corresponding normal and friction forces. Additionally, large plastic strains of over 50% had to be modelled using specially developed material laws. The program, which was written in C for the operating system Unix, includes advanced visualisation features, making it very user-friendly. Today it is used in the development departments of various German car manufacturers.
