Application of fire protective coatings on concrete elements The aim of the research project is to enlarge the theoretical and experimental background of the fire behaviour of fire protective coatings applied to concrete and to develop a design model for the calculation of the fire resistance of concrete elements protected by coatings. Spalling of concrete may significantly decrease the fire resistance of concrete structures exposed to fire, in particular in the case of high- and ultrahigh-strength concrete. Coatings applied like paint to the concrete surface creates a highly effective thermal barrier for fire, reducing the risk of spalling. The aim of the research project is to enlarge the theoretical and experimental background of the fire behaviour of fire protective coatings applied to concrete and to develop a design model for the calculation of the fire resistance of concrete elements protected by coatings.
