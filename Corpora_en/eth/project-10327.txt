Seismic Investigations of Grimsel lakes, Bernese Oberland Quantifying sedimentation in powerdam lakes This hydroelectric industry-sponsored project quantifies sedimentation in artificially dammed lakes in the Grimsel area. Results will be applied towards infilling predictions, reconstructions of erosion rates in glaciated catchments, and calibration of climate data with proglacial sedimentation.
