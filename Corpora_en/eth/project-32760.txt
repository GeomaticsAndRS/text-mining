Robust catalysts for the production of solar methanol under fluctuating conditions Based on a solar-induced thermochemical splitting of CO2 and H2O, syngas (CO/CO2/H2) can be produced which can subsequently be converted into methanol. Herein, we aim at identifying a solid catalyst which displays stable performance in spite of the huge fluctuations in availability and composition o Methanol is considered as a prospective key intermediate in industry. Syngas, which is the current exclusive feedstock for methanol production, is nowadays solely produced by steam reforming of fossil resources like natural gas, oil, or coal. Global warming and limited resources force future chemical industries to switch more and more to recycled feedstocks. Recently, thermochemical processes have been developed that enable the splitting of CO2 and H2O into CO, H2, and O2 by utilizing concentrated solar energy. Both CO2 and H2O are abundant compounds, considering that CO2 could be captured in large amounts from power plants in the near future. However, coupling a methanol reactor with a solar syngas producing unit imposes great demands on the methanol synthesis catalyst since the solar reactor can be only operated upon daytime. Testing of a commercial catalyst (Cu-ZnO-Al2O3) in such unsteady methanol synthesis evidenced deactivation due to irreversible formation of zinc carbonate. Current research efforts are directed to the design of a catalyst showing improved stability in this demanding application. Upon succeeding in this task, it will further be considered to combine methanol synthesis with its upgrading to olefins, gasoline, and/or aromatics using a hybrid bed comprising the optimal catalyst identified for the preparation of the alcohol and a tailored zeolite.
