Regenerational Ecology in a Group Regeneration Gap. The Natural Dynamics ofMixed Species and Their Competitive Relationship in the Thicket Phase of aYoung Forest Stand The development of a natural regeneration, initiated by a group selection, is being surveyed repeatedly. The study focuses on the developmental tendency of each tree species and their competitive behaviour influenced by several site factors like light conditions, degree of browsing etc. A further investigation compares tended thickets with untended ones. The studies are also used in silvicultural teaching.
