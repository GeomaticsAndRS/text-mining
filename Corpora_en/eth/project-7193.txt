Ecological Behavior's Dependency on Different Forms of Knowledge: A Representative SurveyAmong German-Speaking Swiss Citizens The influence of environmental knowledge on ecological behavior is underestimated systematically. Two reasons can be held responsible. First, it is not the mere amount of knowledge available that determines behavior. Different forms of knowledge must work together in a convergent manner if they are to foster ecological behavior. Second, psychological factors such as knowledge apparently have a limited influence on ecological behavior when strong contextual constraints are effective. When an ecological behavioral measure makes­as a performance test­systematic use of such contextual influences though, knowledge can be expected to affect ecological behavior most remarkably. First a three dimensional measure of environmental knowledge, consisting of system, action, and effectiveness knowledge, will be developed and evaluated, based on item response theory (N = 900). Second, the structure of environmental knowledge will be explored in some detail. And third, representative and valid information about Swiss environmental knowledge and ecological behavior as well as about the relationship between the two concepts will be provided (N = 2700). The newly developed measures for three different types of environmental knowledge are methodologically and theoretically unique. Ideally, the study will help in tailoring future campaigns to promote ecological performance.
