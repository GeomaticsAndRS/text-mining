Multi Functional Wearable Wireless Medical Monitoring Based on A Multi Channel Data Acquisition and Communication Management System on a Chip (WEARMESOC) For both in- and outpatient applications the el. interface to typical sensors and electrodes is still embodied in size and weight that prevents it from being used in the convenient and flexible way. Integration of the plethora of functionalities is therefore required in a wearable medical monitor.
