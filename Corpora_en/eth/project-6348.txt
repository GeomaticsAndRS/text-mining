Physical Environment - Lighting: Perception and Assessment of Artificially Lighted Spaces Lighting engineers and ergonomists are often confronted with the problem that the architect's requests for lighting often do not consider ergonomic needs. Mostly the architects consider aesthetic and psychological parameters of lighting. When planning lighting more care should be taken with the accumulative effect (visual climate). The aim of this study is to develop a procedure, by means of which a measure can be calculated from the distribution of luminance produced by specific lighting and which considers subjective and objective parameters of lighting as well. On one hand this measure shall serve the architects for planning. On the other hand the procedure shall help the light engineer to estimate the qualitative characteristics of an illumination.
