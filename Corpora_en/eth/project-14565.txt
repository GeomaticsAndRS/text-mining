Development of a magnesium-selective sensor Magnesium-selective electrodes based on ionophores developed at ETHZ achieve the highest-selectivity to monovalent ions. Additionally, the basic theories to achieve the best performance of the electrodes were developed in our group. This know-how is transfered to the industrial partner.
