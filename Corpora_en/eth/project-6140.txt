Design of Grouting Cylinder in Tunnelling Tunnel excavation in soil or extreme weak rocks under high overburden and high water pressure is only possible by applying drainage and consolidation of the ground. As a rule, extensive grouting works are carried out to create a zone with improved mechanical properties surrounding the tunnel. The research project deals with design and analysis of the grouting cylinder. Extent of plastification of the grouting cylinder, its deformations as well as the rock pressures acting upon the tunnel lining are estimated by means of elasto-plastic hydraulic-mechanical coupled finite-element computations. Various effects (such as drainage, seepage-flow, length of the critical geological zone) are also taken into account. The results of comprehensive parametric studies will be presented in the form of dimensionless ground respone curves which cover the entire relevant range of parameter values.
