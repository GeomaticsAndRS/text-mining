Optical Waveguide Multimode Couplers for Separation and Combination of Fundamentaland First Order Modes Multimode interference couplers (MMI) are increasingly explored as power-splitters and combiners for fundamental (zero order) modes. New applications in integrated optics make use of first order modes. For example one controls in an all-optical switch a data-signal with a second optical control-signal. The control-signal can perform the data-processing wheter it is a zero order mode or a first order mode. However, if the control-signal is coupled into the all-optical switch as a first order mode the device can be operated bidirectional. Novel multi-mode-interference (MMI)-coupler [1], so called MMI-converter-combiner, were designed in view of all-optical switches that use a first order mode to control the switch. Depending on whether one introduces a fundamental order mode at input one of two possible inputs, the mode is converted into a higher order mode. R. Hess, J. Leuthold, P.A. Besse, H.
