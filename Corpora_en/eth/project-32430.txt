Parasitic plant ecology and Signaling among plants This project focuses on the ecology of parasitic plants in the genus Cuscuta, which actively grow toward and attach to above ground plant parts. This project focuses on the ecology of parasitic plants in the genus Cuscuta, which actively grow toward and attach to above ground plant parts. Our finding that C. pentagona seedlings utilize host-derived olfactory cues to grow towards hosts was one of the first definitive demonstrations of plant perception of and response to environmental odors. In subsequent work we have explored the echanisms of host-location in further detail and characterized plant defense responses to attack by this parasite. Current work is exploring how parasite foraging is impacted by abiotic environmental cues including light and temperature and on characterizing the interactions of the parasite with insect herbivores and exploring how such interactions are influenced by solutes translocated from the host plant (including defensive toxins and signaling compounds).
