Rational Design of Immunotherapeutics Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-encoded proteins form a family of highly polymorphic molecules whose function is the presentation of antigenic peptides to T-lymphocytes. The expression of some MHC alleles is highly related to susceptibility or resistance to autoimmune diseases. The aim of the project is the design of nonpeptide inhibitors for one MHC protein (HLA-B27) whose expression confers susceptibility to inflammatory spondyloarthropathies. Starting from the crystal structure of HLA-B27, several nonnatural ligands have been designed using either iterative modification of the canonical nonapeptide structure of natural ligands or using virtual screening of three-dimensional databases. The binding potency of all designed ligands is measured by refolding the recombinant protein in presence of the inhibitor. Therefore, we used a new fluorescence polarization assay. Such nonnatural ligands represent very promising tools for the selective immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases linked to the HLA-B27 allele.
