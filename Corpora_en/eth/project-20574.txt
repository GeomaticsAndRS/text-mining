RADLAB Spectroscopic characterization of radiative transport phenomena in hightemperature energy conversion processes. The aim of the radiation heat transfer laboratory (RADLAB) is to experiTask description U mentally determine the radiative properties of fluidized beds, packed beds, aerosol flows, porous structures, reticulate ceramics, micro channels, and other solid-gas configurations used in hightemperature solar reactors. For this purpose spectroscopy systems and associated data evaluation methods are being developed. Parameters of interest are the spectral extinction coefficient, the absorption coefficient, the scattering phase function, and the bi-directional reflectivity as a function of wavelength and direction. The current system comprises a double VIS-IR lamp coupled to a double moCurrent system U nochromator as the radiation source, collimating/focusing lenses, a sample group, and a detector. µ m for materials of It enables measuring the intensity distribution in the wavelength range 0.3U4 moderate optical thickness such as reticulate porous ceramics and particle clouds. For materials of larger optical thickness, such as densely packed beds, the wavelength region is more limited and µ m. typically lies within 0.4U2 Planned extensions aim at allowing measurement of wavelengths up to 10 System extension U µ m and at performing measurements on heated samples. This will allow obtaining the radiative properties in the entire wavelength range of interest for solar thermal energy applications.
