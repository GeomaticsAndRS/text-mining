Tree diseases and landscape processes Transdisciplinarity between forest pathology and landscape ecology leads to offspring tackling tree fungal diseases at a coarser scale and with a broader array of tools. We provide literature reviews exploring this new space. Forest pathology inherently involves a landscape dimension, as tree diseases propagate according to heterogeneous spatial patterns of flow and resistance. Landscape pathology is now emerging from the transdisciplinary cooperation of forest pathologists with landscape ecologists. We review recent assessments of tree disease risk at the landscape level, investigations of site and host preferences for several root rot pathogens, and regional historical analyses of pathogen outbreak in plantations. Critical topics comprise fragmentation effects on pathogen spread and geophysical features predisposing forest patches to disease expression. Recent methodical developments allow the spatio-temporal integration of analysis and reciprocal coarse-scale relationships among hosts and pathogens. Landscape pathology studies fill a significant research gap in the context of sustainable forest management, introduction of exotic organisms, and climate change.
