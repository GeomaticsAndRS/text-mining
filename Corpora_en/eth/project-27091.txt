Subglacial Controls on the Short Term Dynamics at the Margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet: Seismic experiments This project is a compliment to the funded SNF proposal SSubglacial ¸ ˇ Controls on the Short Term dynamics at the Margin of the Greenland Ice SheetT. This project includes hot water drilling and borehole geophysical measurements such as englacial deformation and basal water pressure.
