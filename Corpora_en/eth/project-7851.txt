Characterisation of Ferroelectric Surfaces and Ferroelectric Domainswith Scanning Force Microscopy New efforts are paid on the investigation of ferroelectric surface properties on a very local scale. Polarization alignment both within a crystal and with respect to an electric field applied externally is important for optical and storage properties of these crystals. However, these polarization processes as well as the dynamic motion of individual ferroelectric domain walls are badly understood from a mesoscopic point of view. This is mostly because experimental evidences on the molecular scale are lacking. We therefore investigate ferroelectric crystals (i.e. triglycine-sulphate (TGS) and BaTiO$_{3}$) with scanning force microscopy (SFM) in order to differentiate between topographic surface features and the ferroelectric domain structures within these crystals. Specifically, non-contact and contact operation of the SFM reveals the distinct differentiation in polarization and topographic contrast which can be measured simultaneously. Also surface decoration processes due to surface charges seem to play an important role affecting the local surface topographic properties. Further, SFM is able to record the transition from the ferroelectric into the paraelectric phase in direct space and real-time. Additionally, domain nucleation and growth processes can be monitored upon cooling of such a crystal. Our experiments reveal no memory effects which inherently suggest the SFM to be used for the local manipulation of surface molecules and ferroelectric domains.
