Changes in Cerebral Oxygenation in Response to Visual, Acoustic, Tactile andOlfactory Stimulation in Newborns as Measured by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy A largely unsolved problem in neonatal medicine consists of the inability to estimate the functional severity and the progress of a brain injury which may be due to perinatal asphyxia or an infection and to formulate a prognosis of the neurological outcome. An important determinant of brain function is associated with perfusion, oxygenation and cerebral blood volume. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive method suitable for continuous and repetitive bedseide monitoring of critically ill preterm children which allows to monitor relevant hemodynamic parameters. The aims of the project are: 1. Development of a NIRS device for neonatal medicine with a very high S/N ratio which allows to measure minute changes in cerebral oxygenation. 2. Development of a sensor system which enables a local differentiation and resolution of hemodynamic parameters. 3. Implementation and evaluation of a system for functional stimulation and analysis of the responding local areas (mapping) in terms of oxygenation changes in newborns.
