Materials for the Primary Circuit - Their Stress Corrosion Crack Growth Rates This study aims to measure and predict the stress corrosion behavior of materials used in the primary circuit of pressurized water reactors. The materials tested are primarily those actually in use today and wich cause major problems due to their stress corrosion susceptibility, such as alloy 600 and alloy 182. The goal of this project is to obtain sufficient and reliable quantitative knowledge about the actual materials, and, in addition, to evaluate those alloys which are foreseen to replace them in the future, such as alloy 800, 690, and alloy 152.
