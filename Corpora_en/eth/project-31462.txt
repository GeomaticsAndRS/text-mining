Evaluating Climate Policies in the Electricity Sector with a Hybrid Top-Down/Bottom-Up Model This project analyses the impact of climate policies on electricity generation within a general equilibrium framework. This project analyses the impact of climate policies on electricity generation within a general equilibrium framework. A small open economy model of Germany with a disaggregated representation of electricity generation technologies is developed. As transmission of electricity plays an important role, the electricity grid is also represented in the model. The static, dynamic, and stochastic versions of the model are used in order to evaluate important climate policies such as emission trading, renewable energy support mechanisms, and research and development approaches. The project also contains a dissemination strategy to inform stakeholders and decisionmakers in the German climate and energy policy.
