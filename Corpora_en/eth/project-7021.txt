Why War? Fundamental Issues in War and Peace In his famous letter to Sigmund Freud in 1932, Albert Einstein raised the question of Why war? If we had an answer to this question, we would be able to predict wars and conflicts and choose appropriate times for intervention before conflicts began. Because human conflict behavior is determined by numerous factors as a result of human biological and cultural evolution, investigation of this central issue must take an integrated approach. For this reason, the book project Why War? Fundamental Issues in War and Peace seeks to connect the findings of the natural sciences with knowledge from the humanities and social sciences in order to explain why wars continue to dominate human history. A first part of the project examines the inner constellations of human conflict behavior. These constellations are characterized by biological, anthropological, psychological, and behavior theory aspects. Of particular research interest is the relation between biological and cultural determinants of human behavior and their interaction in conflict behavior. The second part of the project turns to the practical handling of war and peace.
