EPR study of heme binding in the CcmE protein CcmE is a heme chaperone that transiently binds free heme from periplasm and delivers it to cytochrome c during its maturation. This protein is known to bind heme covalently but recent studies suggest that the heme binding residue is a histidine instead of a cysteine, which is a completely new motive for hemeproteins. EPR techniques can provide valuable information about such a binding by studying heme coordination. This can be done monitoring the spin state of iron and the hyperfine interactions with magnetic nuclei of the environment. Particularly interesting are the interactions with imino nitrogen of histidine side chains. (in collaboration with Prof. L. ThoenyMeier, ETH, Zürich)
