Parallel certification according to FSC- and Q-label Systems Under the request of the Swiss Timber Industry Board, the WWF, Pro Natura and the Ministry of Environment two certification products were applied in 1999/2000 to 10'000 ha with 18 Forest Enterprises and 156 primarily small owners in the cantons of Grisons and Zurich. The theoretical foundations and processes of both certifications have been analysed and the results compared. Almost all forest enterprises received both labels and were therefore independently positively rated with both systems. Both systems are essentially equivalent, though they do not say the same. The reduction of certifications costs and a narrower definition of the national standard is a primary concern for the future. (completed September 2000)
