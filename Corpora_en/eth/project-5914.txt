Site-directed Mutagenesis of Herpes Simples Virus Type 1 Thymidine Kinase(HSV1 TK) An important target of antiviral therapy against Herpes Simples Virus is the viral enzyme thymidine kinase (HSV1 TK). Knowledge of the structure of the active site of the TK as well as the interaction of single amino acids with the substrate would facilitate the development of more efficient and less toxic drugs against herpes infections. Using computer-aided molecular design, an active-site model has been established and among others the amino acids Q104, R106, D162, H164 and D313 were predicted to be important for the enzymatic activity. To prove this model site-directed mutagenesis was performed. Changes in the active site should alter the enzymatic activity or the substrate specifity. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the phosphorothioate method, using the kit marketed by Amersham. The sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing according to Sanger. In order to obtain an easily availible source for kinetic experiments HSV1 TK was expressed in E. coli strain SF110 (ompT-) as an inducible glutathion S-acetyl transferase (GST) fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified in a fast an gentle one step procedure namely by glutathione affinity chromatography. After proteolytic cleavage of the column bound GST-TK with thrombin we obtained nearly pure TK. The biochemical characterisation of the mutants will be done by determination of the Km values for thymidine, ATP and aciclovir.
