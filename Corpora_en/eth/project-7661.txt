Dynamics and Failure of Sandwich Structures under Impact Loading Energy absorption due to short impacts is one of the new applicationfields in which sandwich structures are used with increasing success. Inorder to understand the dynamic mechanisms leading to damage, experimentsare carried out on sandwich specimens loaded by a gunshot with relativelyhigh impact velocities of 200-300 m/s and short impact duration times of 30microsec. The penetration of the specimen is avoided by a coin shaped steelplate which is attached to the upper facing. It acts as a very stiff loaddistributor and has significant influence on the damage development.Investigations are concentrated on a particular type of damage in the coreof the structure which is not visible from outside. Theoretical hypothesesconcerning this damage pattern are checked by numerous experimentalparametric studies.In the central region of the plate (or the beam) the extremely stiff steelplate distributes the impact load evenly on the facing surface anddetermines an area, where mainly longitudinal waves propagate across thethickness of the core. Connecting this central region to the structuralmodel of the sandwich plate by a transition region, one can predict theprincipal stresses in the core due to the impact, from which the location,the starting time and the angle of the first crack can be determined. Basedon the theoretical and the experimental results, efforts will be made inorder to increase the impact resistance of the investigated type ofsandwich structures.
