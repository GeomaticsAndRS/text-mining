Solubility of Silica and Magnesia in Hydrous Supercritical Fluids at High Pressuresand Temperatures Silica (SiO$_{2}$) and to a lesser extent Magnesia (MgO) are very soluble in aqueous supercritical fluids at high pressures. Experimental data exist to 3 GPa and 1200\dgC. The quantification of the solubility of these two components, which contribute 85% of common upper mantle rocks, is essential in understanding the role of silica metasomatism by supercritical hydrous fluids in the upper mantle as the result of dehydration of subducted oceanic lithosphere (basalts to harzburgites). Experimental studies are performed, using the multi-anvil ultrahigh pressure apparatus in the range from 4 to 10 GPa and 800\dgC to 1500\dgC on compositions in the forsterite - enstatite quartz - H$_{2}system (MSH).
