Encoded self-assembling chemical libraries (ESACHEL) At present, antibodies and aptamers are the only classes of molecules which can be generated with high-affinity against virtually any target. The pharmaceutical relevance of aptamers remains to be demonstrated. Antibody derivatives can be immunogenic in vivo, are slow at crossing endothelial cell barriers in vivo and cannot be used to target intracellular targets. The isolation of specific binding molecules (e.g. organic molecules) is a central problem in chemistry, biology and pharmaceutical sciences. Typically, millions of molecules have to be screened, in order to find a suitable candidate. The preparation of very large libraries of organic molecules is typically cumbersome. Furthermore, the complexity associated with the identification of specific binding molecules from a pool of candidates grows with the size of the chemical library to be screened. In ESACHEL technology , we use self-assembling libraries of organic molecules (typically forming dimers, trimers or tetramers), in which the organic molecules are linked to an oligonucleotide which mediates the self-assembly of the library and/or provides a code associated to each binding moiety. The resulting library can be very large (as it originates by the combinatorial self-assembly of smaller sub-libraries). After the capture of the desired binding specificities on the target of interest, the binding code can be decoded by a number of experimental techniques (e.g., hybridization on DNA chips or by a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique followed by sequencing).
