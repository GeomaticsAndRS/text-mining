Controlled release of nanostructured nutrients in food fortification and supplementation We produce nanoparticles in a top-down process (from 50Âµ m to 100nm) by micro media milling. Factors, as bead size, rational speed, residence time and effect of surfactants, influencing the grinding efficiency. The aim is to reach a high surface area and bioavailability.
