ARCHEOLOGICAL PROSPECTING Most critical archeological targets are hidden in the shallow subsurface. The thickness of the overlying soil cover may range from centimeters to meters. Logistical and financial constraints and the risk of destroying the archeological structures often preclude complete excavation of interesting areas. Non-destructive testing with geophysical methods is a powerful alternative to image the subsurface and to locate critical features for selective excavation. Main problems to be addressed include consideration of structural complexity at typical archeological sites and the smallness of some targets. Successful application of geophysical techniques thus requires highly sensitive equipment, very dense spatial sampling and sophisticated data analysis tools. The ETH group of applied and environmental geophysics owns state-of-the-art equipment for high-resolution prospecting. Furthermore, extremely efficient methods for rapid data acquisition have been developed. In the framework of this project, we have developed new inversion algorithms suitable for delineating shallow two- and three-dimensional structures. The archeological site near Unterstammheim, which contains the remains of an early medieval settlement, was chosen to test a new inversion algorithm for magnetic data. The targets were pit houses, an important form of accommodation during medieval times. The magnetic anomalies were caused by magnetic susceptibility differences of humus infilling the pit house and the surrounding host sediments. Inversion of the magnetic data provided the horizontal locations and three-dimensional shapes of the pit houses. The reliability of the subsurface model was checked by drilling a short hole through the pit-house. The base of humus filling the pit-house was encountered within a few centimeters of that predicted by the model.
