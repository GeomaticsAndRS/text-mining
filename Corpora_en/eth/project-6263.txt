Dynamic Model for Water Management in Urban Systems (Synaqua) Water is the most important mass commodity to support the human activity to  clean . The importance of anthropogenic water economy in the study region of SYNOIKOS is hardly perceptible anymore. There is no identification with the activity to clean and its relation to water. Practically 100% of the total water supply stems from regional groundwater sources. The aquifers are situated mainly under settlement areas (60%) and agricultural land. During the last decades several drinking water pumps showed pollution by anthropogenic activities. These perturbations were overcome by an enlargement of the number of groundwater pump stations and by connecting the different individual sources to a large water supply network. It allows a very flexible distribution with respect to varying demands and to changing qualities.
