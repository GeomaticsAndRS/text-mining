Trusted components Trusted components are reusable software components equipped with a guarantee of quality. The Trusted Components project develops tools and techniques for achieving this goal, based on Component Quality Model . Development of reusable software elements ("Trusted Components") with a guarantee of high quality. These can be existing commercial components, for which we provide analysis and certification, or components developed specifically for this purpose, enabling proofs of correctness (see Classes Proved Correct project). The project also involves systematic, push-button techniques for component testing, and the development of a Component Quality Model.
