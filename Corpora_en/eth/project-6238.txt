Supercritical flow in bend manholes Bend manholes are a typical element of wastewater hydraulics. These behave different in subcritical and supercritical flows, given the development of shock waves for the latter flow type. The research intended to develop a novel manhole design that allows to discharge supercritical flows without danger in terms of clogging, transition to choked two-phase flow and eventually resulting in lift-off of manhole cover. The manhole flow may be described for both the 45\dg and the 90\dg deflections similar: Due to flow deflection, a bend wave occurs along the outer manhole wall, with a maximum wave height depending on the relative bend curvature and the upstream Froude number in the partially filled circular shaped sewer. In order to discharge such highly non-uniform into the downstream sewer, a socalled manhole extension was added to the conventional manhole, corresponding to a straight U-shaped piece of two diameter length. Accordingly, the bend wave may be reduced before entering the downstream sewer. The discharge capacity of that novel bend manhole may simply be expressed with the pipe Froude number, i.e. the ratio between discharge and the square root of gravitational acceleration times the sewer diameter in the fifth power. The internal flow features of the manhole flow were also analysed. It was found that the bend manhole is the most critical manhole structure in a sewer system, given its relative small discharge capacity.
