Understanding the causes and future direction of the present rapid thinning of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland Jakobshavn Isbrae is the fastest of three large outlet glaciers known to be thinning rapidly in Greenland. Coinciding with surface drawdown was the retreat of the calving front by 10 km, and a doubling of flow speed to 14 km/year in the last 10 years. This will be anlaysed in a modelling study.
