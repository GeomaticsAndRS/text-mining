Gene-specific Transcription Regulators Specificity of gene regulation in eukaryotic cells relies not only on genespecific DNA recognition by transcription factors, but also on cooperative interactions between these heterologous factors. Our current research on gene-specific regulators is on enzymes that modify the chromatin template. Specificity of gene regulation in eukaryotic cells relies not only on gene-specific DNA recognition by transcription factors, but also on cooperative interactions between these heterologous factors. Although the structures of many DNA-binding domains of transcription factor proteins bound to their cognate DNA sites have been determined (e.g. [1-3]), only a few examples of multiple factor complexes are available. We have solved the high-resolution X-ray structures of the yeast MCM1/MATalpha2/DNA [4] and the human SRF/SAP1/DNA [5] complexes which play critical roles in yeast cell-type determination and the expression of the c-fos oncogene respectively. One highlight from these structures is that they show how protein-protein interaction sequences which are part of long, flexible stretches of the polypeptide chain can be responsible for cooperative interaction. Our structures of the yeast MCM1, the human SRF (serum response factor) and the human MEF2a (myocyte enhancer factor-2a) proteins bound to DNA were the first three MADS-box structures determined for this family of transcription factors. Our current research on gene-specific regulators is directed at enzymes that modify the chromatin template [6].
