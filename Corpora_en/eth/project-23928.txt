OPEN HOUSE OPEN HOUSE U lity on the EU based on transparency and openness (open source and availability) from model to implementation. The overall objective of OPEN HOUSE is to develop and to implement a common European transparent building assessment methodology, complementing the existing ones, for planning and constructing sustainable buildings by means of an open approach and technical platform. OPEN HOUSE will develop a transparent approach able to emerge collectively in an open way across the EU. This approach will be communicated to all stakeholders and their interaction and influence on the methodology will be assured in a democratic way. The baseline will be existing standards (both CEN/TC 350 and ISO TC59/SC17), the EPBD Directive and its national transpositions, and methodologies for assessing building sustainability at international, European and national level.
