Plasticity of RuAl Alloys The intrinsic brittleness of most intermetallics is one of the major obstacles to their use as high-temperature structural materials. In this respect, RuAl and ternary ruthenium aluminides are exceptional, since they exhibit a significant room temperature ductility. Moreover, with a melting point above 2000 rC, they are noted for good high-temperature strength, excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance, good electrical and thermal conductivity as well as thermal shock resistance. In this project, the mechanical properties of stoichiometric RuAl were investigated. Uniaxial compression tests were performed to determine the thermal activation parameters of the deformation process at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 900 rC. Experiments on ruthenium aluminides have been conducted mostly on polycrystalline samples. Some single crystals of RuAl have been obtained that have been used in uniaxial compression tests. Investigations concentrated on the temperature and strain-rate dependence of yielding, the activation volume and the stress exponent as determined from stress-relaxation experiments and strain-rate changes, and the activation enthalpy obtained from temperature changes. The results are currently being analyzed and will be rationalized in terms of microstructural features obtained for deformed and undeformed specimens by transmission electron microscopy.
