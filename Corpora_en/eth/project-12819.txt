CellMAC: a novel technology for encapsulation of mammalian cells in cellulose sulfate/pDADMAC capsules assembled on a transient alginate/Ca2+ scaffold Microencapsulation of desired mammalian cell phenotypes in biocompatible polymer matrices represents a powerful technology for cell-based therapies and biopharmaceutical manufacturing of protein therapeutics. We have pioneered a novel jet break-up-compatible process for encapsulation.
