Taxonomy of Acetic Acid Bacteria The aerobic acetic acid bacteria, composed of the genera Acetobacter and Gluconobacter, represent together with Rhodopila globiformis, Acidiphilium and Acidocella a cluster of acidophilic bacteria with a distinct line of descent in the a-subclass of Proteobacteria (M. Sievers. W. Ludwig. M. Teuber, 1995: System. Appl. Microbiol. Vol. 17, 189-196). The closely related species Acetobacter europaeus (used for the production of vinegar) and Acetobacter xylinum (component of the tea fungus fermentation) were phenotypically distinguished by the absolut requirement of acetic acid for the growth of the A. europaeus strains. Acetobacter contains four ribosomal RNA operons on the chromosome. Transfer RNA genes for isoleucine, alanine and antitermination sequences are present in the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA spacer region of A europaeus and A xylinum (M. Sievers, L. Alonso, S. Gianotti, C. Boesch, M. Teuber: 1996, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. Vol. 142, 43-48). Differences in the nucleotide sequence of the 23S rRNA enable the development of specific oligonucleotide probes for discrimination between A. europaeus and A. xylinum strains on the DNA level (DNA for 23S ribosomal RNA gene, database accession no.: A. europaeus X89771, A. xylinum X89812).
