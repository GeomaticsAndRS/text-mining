Ultra High Pressure Metamorphic Rocks, Cima Lunga Suite The detailed structure, geochemistry, and metamorphism of the ultramafic-mafic Cima Lunga suite are studied together with a surrounding melange of crustal rocks to evaluate the origin and history of the suite; the question of which rocks were affected by the ultra-high pressure metamorphism. Ultra-high pressure metamorphism is crucial in understanding collisional orogeny in syntaxial mountain chains.
