Pillared Clays Clay liners may be exposed to temperatures above 70\dgC from biological and chemical reactions in the waste above the liner. There have, therefore, been some doubts about the quality of clay liners with respect to the drying effect and the occurrence of heat produced cracks in the liner. The clay minerals are supposed to adsorb organic and inorganic pollutants from the leachate. Pillared clays are known as good adsorbers and are also heat resistant. The project involves the producing and testing of various pillared clays for use in or as liner material.
