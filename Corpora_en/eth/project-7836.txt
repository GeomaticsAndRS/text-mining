Information Storage in Ferroelectric Crystals Development of high density, high capacity storage devices will inevitably force the manufacturers to exploit the third dimension of the storage medium. We are exploring the future capabilities of holographic optical storage systems by using the state of the art materials and by using the advanced multiplexing schemes. Inorganic electro-optic crystals as well as organic materials can be considered. Inducing changes in material properties lies at the heart of information storage in crystals. Such changes may be either permanent (in the case of read-only memories) or reversible (for read/write memories). Inducing these changes optically adds the advantage of parallelism. Photorefractive gratings, which normally decay under illumination, can be fixed in two ways. Through the formation of ferroelectric domains or through the motion of optically inactive ionic charges, which both electrically compensate the primary space-charge field. We are also exploring advanced multiplexing techniques such as mixed spatio-angular multiplexing, phase encoding and wavelength encoding. We have designed a holographic optical storage system to act as a buffer memory for a fast optical correlator for image recognition. Construction of the system is under progress.
