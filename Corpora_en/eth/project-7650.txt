Mechanical Properties of Microstructures In this project, materials commonly used in micromechanics are characterized withthe aim of deducing design-parameters of micromechanical elements. Static (e.g.tension, torsion, bending) as well as dynamic testing methods (vibrations, fatiguetests) are performed on microstructures. In a first step monocristalline silicon (SCSi)and metallic specimens made with the LIGA technique are investigated. Theevaluation of the experimental results is made with analytical models and by usingFEM. The question whether the concepts of critical stresses and failure mechanismsof classical theories can be applied to structures with dimensions of some micrometersis also studied. From the results of microsample tensile tests with SCSi structures,a new design criterion is proposed for failure at sharp notches (based on energyconsiderations). Elongations of 10 nm are resolved by analysing optical microscope imageswith a new method (LSM-algorithm developed by G. Danuser, Image Science Lab., ETHZ).Dynamic experiments have already been performed. Several modesof vibration (bending, torsional, longitudinal) have been excited with electrostaticforces or piezoceramic transducers. Having the microstructure vibrating in avacuum chamber, very high Q-factors have been measured: 60000 for bending and 120000 for torsionalmodes. From the measurement of the resonance frequencies and a FEM modalanalysis it was possible to determine the elastic parameters (Young's modulus E frombending and shear modulus G from torsional vibration).Torsion experiments are also performed. The tiny torques of \gmNm aremeasured using micro-torque-sensors based on differential force measurement with aresolution of 0.3 \gmNm. The combination of tensile tests and torsion tests allows todetermine the structural resistance under complex loading conditions.
