The role of autophagy during oogenesis in Drosophila Autophagy is a degradation process regulated by the target of Rapamycin (TOR)/Insulin signaling pathway. Interestingly, growth factor signaling and nutrient availability affects ovary development in Drosophila. The aim of this project is to delineate the function of autophagy during oogenesis.
