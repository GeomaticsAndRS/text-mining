Application of 3D Geographic Information Systems for transparent and sustainable planning of electric power systems The project aims to develop an integrated GIS-based 3D DSS web-platform to compute optimal paths for new power transmission lines, to visualize them in 3D and to enhance the communication among all involved stakeholders in order to minimize time efforts and to reduce social opposition. Defining the optimal path of transmission lines is a time consuming planning task that is often impacted by strong social opposition. The scope of this project is the development of an integrated 3D GIS web-platform to define the optimal path of a new transmission line, to enhance the communication among all stakeholders involved in a project and to reduce the social opposition. An improved 3D visualization to be utilized for community-based decision-making will demonstrate to the stakeholders the impact of the new project on the surroundings.
