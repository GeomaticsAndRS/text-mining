L3, a New Tool for Cosmic Ray Muon Studies The muon spectrometer of the L3 detector at LEP, CERN, will be used to measure the cosmic ray muon spectrum in the momentum range 20 to 2000 GeV/c with high precision. In addition the angular dependence, the charge ratio, and the time variations of the muon spectrum, as well as multimuon events will be studied. These data will give new informations about the primary composition, the muonic neutrino flux (neutrino oscillation) and the air shower development. In a second phase it is foreseen to increase the acceptance, in order to search for astrophysical sources, to detect the moon and sun shadow (this allows to search for primary antiprotons of 1 TeV energy), or to record and analyse exotic events (dark matter?). The L3 spectrometer (30 m under ground) consists of large drift chambers installed in a huge magnet with a volume of 1000 m$^{3}$and a field of 0.5 Tesla. The momentum resolution at 50 GeV is 1.5%, a unique feature among all existing cosmic ray detectors.
