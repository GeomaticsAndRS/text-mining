Paleomagnetic and Deformation Studies in the Appalachian Fold Belt and Appalachian Plateau A series of projects has dealt with the following geologic problems in the central Appalachians: (1) the relationship between the timing of remagnetization and folding across the fold belt and plateau has been examined. (2) Two projects have investigated the origin of the Pennsylvania Salient in the fold belt and on the Plateau. (3) A correlation of magnetic anisotropy with strain and seismic anisotropy on the Plateau has been established. (4) Magnetic anisotropy and strain have been correlated across the fold belt. (5) The relationship between lithology, deformation and magnetic anisotropy within the fold belt is being investigated.
