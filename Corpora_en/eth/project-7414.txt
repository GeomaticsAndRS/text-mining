GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATION OF AN ALPINE ROCK GLACIER Rock glaciers are an important form of Alpine permafrost. Due to their potential instabilities, possibly caused by global warming, they pose a serious natural hazard for mountainous regions. To quantify the mechanical behavior of rock glaciers, a multidisciplinary research program consisting of geophysical, geotechnical and glaciological studies has been initiated. The Muragl rock glacier, located in the eastern Swiss Alps, has been chosen as a test site where a number of surface and borehole experiments were conducted in order to establish efficient monitoring procedures. Some of the problems that made this investigation difficult were: (i) strong heterogeneities of the rock glacier material, (ii) pronounced topographic variations, and (iii) logistic constraints in an Alpine region 2600 m above-sea-level. High-resolution seismic profiles have been recorded on the surface of the rock glacier followed by the drilling of four 70 m deep boreholes in which crosshole seismic and georadar measurements have been conducted. Tomographic inversions of the surface and borehole data have allowed the bedrock depth and extent of intact and degraded permafrost to be mapped.
