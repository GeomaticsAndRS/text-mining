Betonstahlbruchortung mittels magnetischer Streufeldmethode / Break Detection in Reinforcing Bars Using the Magnetic Flux Leakage Method Tests are planned to localize breaks in the reinforcement of concrete structures by measuring the magnetic flux leakage fields of the reinforcing bars. The aim of this investigation is to develop a modular measurement system and to gain experience interpreting experimental data.
