Man Machine Interaction - E-Learning E-work: http://www.iha.bepr.ethz.ch/e-work/ E-Work is a distributed team-work between students of three universities (ETHZ, Uni-Karlsruhe, Uni- Frankfurt). E-work has been running since 1998 (ETHZ Lecture No 32-731 G). Students in the distributed student teams work together on a common student assignment. E-Work enables the participating students to experience the state of the art of the CSCW technology (computer supported co-operative work). The project groups apply the technology on practical tasks and work together in gaining practical and theoretical knowledge. Our assignments are sampled from E-Themes. Although most of the co-operation, team interactions and development during the semester proceeds virtually with videoconference technology and other co-operation tools, we also advocate the importance of face to face meetings. Such meetings are arranged at the beginning and at the end of the semester. E-work offers a unique possibility to study real computer supported distributed work. The participants use the state of the art videoconference technology and group ware, and do present their end Work as a Web product. The fact that the students work under time and performance pressure (their product must be finished in 16 weeks and will be graded), makes the working conditions to some degree comparable to fields outside the university. In E-work, we have the possibility to adapt the conditions to fit actual research interests.
