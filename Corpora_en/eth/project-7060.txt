Occupational Trajectories and Socio-economic Change. The project investigates the effects of social and technological change over the past decades on occupational careers in Switzer-land. We try to answer the following questions: What are typical occupational career patterns in Switzerland? How did these patterns change? To what extent are the observed changes related to the impact of new technologies and how do they affect different social groups? In order to answer these questions we compare the educational and occupational careers of two Swiss birth cohorts born 1949-1951 and 1959-1961 respectively. The analyses are based on a 1989 mailed retrospective survey of representative cohort-samples.
