Measurement of the Transverse Polarization of the Positrons fromthe Decay of Polarized Muons This experiment is designed to make a precision measurement of the two possible transverse components of the positron polarization from the decay of polarized muons. It will be performed at the PSI accelerator with a high intensity muon beam. These muons are highly polarized and arrive in individual bunches every 20 ns at a graphite stopping target in the center of a pair of Helmholtz coils. The magnetic field strength is chosen so that the precession frequency of the stopped muon spins equals the accelerator frequency which is responsible for the time structure mentioned above. This stroboscopic method allows to stop many muons simultaneously. In our experiment 200 muons will be in the target at any moment corresponding to a stopping rate of 100/s. Positrons from the decay of these muons and emerging parallel to the field are then detected by a plastic scintillator and a drift chamber array. They then can interact with polarized electrons in a magnetized iron foil transverse to their line of flight. Annihilation in flight of the decay positrons with the polarized electrons is sensitive to any transverse positron polarization. In that case the resulting two-gamma distribution is not azimuthally isotropic any more. The anisotropy of the gamma quanta will then be measured by an array of 127 BGO counters. We expect to reach a precision of 3*10$^{-3}$for the two transverse polarization components P$_{T1}$and P$_{T2}$. The energy dependence of P$_{T1}$ will yield an improved value for the muon decay parameter eta which enters directly into the determination of the Fermi coupling constant G$_{F}$. Any non-zero P$_{T2}$will signal violation of time reversal invariance. This is the only test of this symmetry in a purely leptonic reaction up to now. Both polarization components can also be analyzed in the framework of the most general four-fermion interaction. On the basis of the experimentally observed dominance of the standard model interaction V-A these components depend linearly on a scalar coupling which could be due, for example, to charged Higgs bosons.
