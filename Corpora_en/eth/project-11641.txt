Non monotonic flow of fluids near phase transition Flow instabilities are observed, if macromolecular microstructures either in a bulk fluid or at interfaces form flow-induced structures supporting local phase transion. Such phenomena are observed in rheometric flows using optical means like light scattering technique and quantified.
