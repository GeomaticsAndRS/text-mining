Use of Young Forest Stands by Birds During Autumn Migration Conservation of suitable breeding, wintering and resting habitats is one of the most important conditions for maintaining viable populations of migrating bird species. However, relatively little knowledge on stopover ecology of migrants has yet been gained by using standardized methods. Especially the role of forests as stopover habitat is almost unknown. For an initial study, a reafforestation plot was selected. In Switzerland, young forest stands cover a total area of 85'000 ha, therefore having a large potential as resting habitat. Because of their low and open vegetation cover, birds can be recorded by the same methods as are used in comparable studies in marshlands. Finally, the range of species expected to occur in these habitats during migration is likely to include not only forest birds, but also some farmland species which would not be found in older stands. The project focusses on (a) the influence of different types of vegetation structure on habitat use by resting birds, and on (b) habitat quality of young forest stands for migrants. Capture-recapture methods with mist nets provide informations on the range of species, number and habitat choice of individuals, changes of body mass, etc. On the practical side, the results of the study will help to include the promotion of biodiversity as a forest management objective.
