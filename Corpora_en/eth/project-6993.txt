International Price Differentiation Different prices of identical products in industrialised countries suggest international price differentiation by multinational enterprises. The aim of this research is to measure international price differences for several products, to determine whether they are caused by price differentiation or cost differences and to look for determinants of successful price differentiation strategies. International price discrimination is a signal for monopoly power and for trade barriers, because otherwise international arbitrage would level the prices. From an economic point of view it is interesting to understand why and how cost independent price differentials can be maintained. Do all enterprises of a certain sector have the same capacity of price differentiation? If not, are the reasons of successful price differentiation the particularity of the product, the industry structure or the organisation of distribution? These questions are of theoretical interest, because of the central role prices play in micro- and macroeconomic theory and their political relevance in the context of European economic integration. The narrowing of price differentials through the abolition of all trade barriers is supposed to be one of the main sources for welfare gains in the common market. The reduction of price differentials should be accelerated by the introduction of the Euro, which ends currency fluctuations and simplifies price comparisons between countries. The empirical analysis of some cases of international price differentiation will be the focus of the research.
