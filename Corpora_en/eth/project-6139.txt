The importance of the dehydroxylation temperature of swellable clay minerals for their environmentalgeotechnical properties Swellable smectites are used as liners and adsorber in waste deposits, for hazardous waste remediation or for isolating radioactive waste. The bentonites in these deposits are exposed to heavy metal lecheate and water steam at temperatures between 50\dgC and 120\dgC caused by reactions in the waste deposit. These conditions lead to changed material properties and a loss of quality. Montmorillonite is the main component of bentonites and therefore reponsible for the properties of the barrier material. We will show the relationship between the changes of the structure of dioctahedral smectites and their dehydroxylation behaviour, respectively, and the geotechnical macroscopic properties. Montmorillonites, which adsorbed heavy metals from the lecheate, are subjected to the HofmannKlemen-effect at temperatures >50\dgC. E.g. Cu$^{2+}$-ions migrate from interlayer positions into octahedral vacancies and could cause a loss of swellability. Water steam at T>100\dgC also causes a movement of Cu$^{2+}$-ions into octahedral positions and Mg$^{2+}$occurred exchangeable in interlayer positions. As the result of these movement of ions in the structure, the specific bonds of the hydroxyl groups have changed and a changed dehydroxylation behaviour could be expected, which is related to geotechnical properties.
