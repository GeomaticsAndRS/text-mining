Transformation of municipal solid waste to raw materials for the construction industry An innovative way in treating municipal solid waste is to melt it at 1500\dgC and therefore removing its heavy metal compounds metallurgically. The remaining melt is basaltic in composition and can be solidified in different manners in order to obtain marketable products ranging from pebble to porous slab. An important product type is a glassy granulate with pozzolanic properties, i.e. this granulate builds up a stone when mixed with Portland cement and water. The granulate can therefore substitute to some extent the primary mineral resource Portland cement. The pozzolanic properties are primarily dependent of the glass structure. Thus the intentional influencing of the glass structure before and/or after solidification of the basaltic melt enhances the reactive behaviour of the granulate and in correlation to it its price.
