Fundamental thermofluidic and interfacial phenomena in fountain pen"based micro/nano-writing and curing of nanoparticle inks This project studies sub-micrometer sized electronic structures by gold ˇ nanoparticle deposition using the Sfountain-pen ¸ T-setup. To achieve consistent patterning in the nanoscale, better understanding of the thermophysical phenomena related to the stability of nanosized colloidal films is required.
