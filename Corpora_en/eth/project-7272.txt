Flexible Power Management by Condition Monitoring of Parallel Converters Flexible power management means that subunits can easily be connected to and disconnected from two or more parallel converters during operation. In large systems, this method reduces the amount of converter power required as well as the cost and size of the system. The principle of flexible power management is new and up until recently existed only in theory. In this project, efforts have been made to improve the theory concerning systems with flexible power management. Initially, the functional blocks of the system were described and their interactions shown. Next, the current distribution control system was examined more closely. This system uses large controller output as is normal in flexible power management. The feasibility of the flexible power management principle was proven in a study completed in June 1993. The three-phase parallel converter developed in that study has been improved, and a new design has been implemented to utilize the theoretical advances. A universal modulator has been constructed, installed and put to work. This modulator allows the user to specify the maximum current into the load with respect to the number of subunits connected to the load. In systems with flexible power management, this number changes during operation. With our three-phase parallel converter, open- and closed-loop operation is possible. In the open-loop operation, the subunits are distributed to the loads by man or by a supervising control. In the closed-loop operation, this is done on the basis of the current demands of the prioritized loads. The three-phase parallel converter has also been used to examine the output currents of the subunits at the time of switching a subunit to another load.
