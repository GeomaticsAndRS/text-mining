Finite Element Analysis of the Human Heart Myocardial fibre stress and the anisotropy deriving from the layered architecture of the ventricular wall are primary determinants of heart muscle mechanics. In various diseases of the heart the spatial fibre arrangement may be distorted which may ultimately lead to heart failure. In order to better understand the anisotropic contractile process in conjunction with ventricular deformation and ejection of blood, the forces and motions associated with the heart cycle have to be analysed. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is particulary well suited for this purpose, as it represents a method to calculate continuum mechanical problems which are characterized by a complicated geometry. Modelling of the geometry, material properties and boundary conditions are the essential steps in the formulation and execution of a FE analysis. To obtain the geometry of the human heart, short axis slices from the apex to the base are performed with Magnetic Resonancs Imaging (MRI). Anisotropy is thereby extrapolated from myocardial tagging techniques (see projects of Prof. Peter Boesiger). The primary boundary conditions are the pressure in the left and right ventricle, which are applied as surface load at the inner side of both ventricles. The incompressible material behaviour and the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the myocardium can be described by a Mooney-Rivlin material law which has to be extended in order to include anisotropy. Of particular importance is furthermore the active phase of the muscle which causes contraction of the ventricles and ejection of blood. To describe this phase of the heart cycle, active material behavior has to be included in the constitutive description. In a future step, the fluid motion (blood) within the ventricle will be modelled in addition by combining the calculation of the fluid and solid components.
