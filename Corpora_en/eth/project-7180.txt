Long-term Habitat Alterations in Swiss Lowland Forests by Changing Forestry Practice Changes of human demands on forest resources (e.g. fire-wood) result in changing management practices. This process has effects on structure and habitats in the forest. The study deals with the following questions: How did the preferred management practices (e.g. simple coppice, coppice with standarts) change in time with respect to importance and spatial distribution? How was the species composition of stands transformed? What were the consequences for habitat types, habitat quality and biodiversity in the forest? The study area is in the Unterland and Weinland region in the Swiss canton of Zurich, and the period since 1820 is being analysed. Special attention is given to the critical assessment of the different types of information sources. The results of this study will help to understand the role of forest practice in determining current biodiversity patterns in managed forests in the lowlands of Switzerland.
