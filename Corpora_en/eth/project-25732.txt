Thermal Storage System for Concentrating Solar Power Project aimed at the design, fabrication, testing, modeling & validation, and optimization of a high-temperature thermal storage system for concentrated solar power. Concentrated solar power (CSP) technology, coupled to thermal storage systems, Background U enables continuous dispatchability of solar electricity. One of the simplest and yet most costeffective and efficient storing mechanisms with air as working fluid is based on a packed bed of rocks: The rocks are heated as hot air from the solar field flows through the packed bed during the day and the energy is extracted during the night by pumping air at ambient temperature through the hot packed bed. The project is aimed at the design, fabrication, testing, modeling & validation, and Objective U optimization of a thermal storage system. The project encompasses the following phases: - Thermal Storage Modeling: Formulation of a dynamic heat transfer model to simulate the transient operation of the storage system. Validation with experimental results from previous campaigns. - Thermal Storage Design and Construction: Design and fabrication of an improved 100 kW thermal storage system using information obtained from the simulations and previous experiments. - Experimental Demonstration: Experimental campaign with the complete system comprised of the solar concentrator, solar receiver and thermal storage. -Evaluation of the thermal performance according to its (solar-to-heat) thermal efficiency. - Model Validation and Optimization: Validation of the heat transfer model by comparison with the results of the experimental campaign. Parametric study to optimize the design and operation, and for scale-up of the thermal storage unit.
