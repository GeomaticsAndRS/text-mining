Tailored matrix systems for highly fatigue loaded glass fiber reinforced polymer structures The mechanical properties of dynamically high-loaded structures out of glass-fiber-reinforced polymers shall be optimized through an aimed modification of the matrix flexibility, which shall lead to a more efficient utilisation of the load capacity of the fibers that lie in the main load direction. Nowadays epoxy resin systems are normally employed as duroplast matrices of glass- and carbonfiber composites. They present advantages in the fiber-matrix bonding and the chemical resistance in comparison to alternative matrices. However the typical disadvantages of the epoxy resin systems, such as low strain at rupture and high fragility, are also present. Such disadvantages come above all through a reinforcement using glass fibers, which present a significantly higher permissible strain at rupture. The glass transition temperature of epoxy resin matrices lie typically in a range of values which are higher as the maximal operating temperature. In this project supported by KTI epoxy and polyurethan matrix systems with different stiffness and toughness values will be formulated and used in the preparation of GFRP components. The properties of the pure matrices, their behavior during processing and the static and dynamic mechanical behavior of the composites will be analyzed by several testing methods, e.g. 3-point-bending, fatigue tests, rheological behavior, curing behavior etc. Based on the results, a method for choosing the optimum matrix for dynamically highly loaded structures out of GFRP will be developed with the assistance of simulation models. Additionaly, a demonstrator part will be fabricated and tested: a scaled rotor blade.
