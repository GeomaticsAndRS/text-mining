Dynamics of Mid-latitude Weather Systems Transient propagating low and high pressure systems together with their accompanying frontal features are the dominant weather systems in mid-latitudes. The generation, structure and prediction of these systems is examined using empirical and theoretical approaches. Diagnostic analyses of observed systems is undertaken based upon the global atmospheric data set of the European Centre for Medium-range Forecasting and using conventional synoptic analysis, potential vorticity concepts, and a Lagrangian-based technique. Theoretical studies are undertaken using a hierarchy of physico-mathematical models extending from simple heuristic to state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction models. Particular attention is being devoted to the factors determining the nature of the surface frontal palette and the upper-level flow features responsible for trans-tropopause transport of mass and chemical constituents.
