Malaria This project explores malaria-induced changes in host odors, the implications of such changes for vector-borne malaria transmission, and the potential for using olfactory cues as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. This project explores malaria-induced changes in host odors, the implications of such changes for vector-borne malaria transmission, and the potential for using olfactory cues as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. This research entails work with rodent malaria in a mouse model (conducted at Penn State University) and work with naturally infected humans in Kenya. To date we have documented consistent differences in the volatile profiles of infected and healthy mice and humans. And we have demonstrated increased mosquito attraction to infected mice, relative to healthy controls, during a key period of infection when the transmissible stage of the parasite is present. We are currently conducting large-scale volatile collections from humans in Africa (including individuals with symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections, as well healthy controls) as well as mosquito behavioral trials with human volatiles. And we are using bioinformatic approaches to identify characteristic signatures of infection.
