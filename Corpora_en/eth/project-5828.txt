Investigation on the Deformation Behaviour of Emulsion Droplets in Steady and Unsteady Shear Flows Emulsion droplets are deformed by shear and normal stresses acting in shear flows. High stresses lead to droplet break up. The extent of droplet deformation in shear flow depends on the rheological behaviour of the dispersed (droplet) and continuous phase fluids. Interfacial behaviour also influences droplet deformation and break up significantly. Many studies have been carried out on the droplet deformation and break up behaviour in fluid flow. In experimental studies the steady state deformation of the droplets has mainly been studied. In this work, the time dependent deformation behaviour of single droplets (100-500 mm) under planar steady shear flow conditions, as well as the relaxation behaviour, are studied. For the experiments, an optical flow device was constructed. The time dependent deformation behaviour was studied theoretically as well as experimentally. The droplet (interface and disperse fluid) was modelled with a rheological model. The behaviour of the model under shear flow conditions was compared with experimental results of the droplet deformation behaviour. The knowledge of the time dependent droplet deformation behaviour is useful for design and development of emulsification processes and related recipes. Using the mechanism of droplet deformation in steady shear flow, a process to create multiphase systems with shape-adjusted particles was developed. The shaped particles are shear-induced structured emulsion droplets which are solidified when they reach a steady ellipsoidal deformation state. As a consequence of the ellipsoidal shape, the viscosity of these suspensions is reduced compared with spherical particle suspensions. These results provide new tools for multiphase product development, e.g. in the field of spreads (improvement of spreadability).
