Exploring rice genetic resources for identification of novel alleles of rice blast resistance genes Rice blast is one of the most devastating fungal diseases in rice, causing heavy annual yield losses. We undertake large scale allele mining on a geographically diverse set of over 4Å 000 rice germplasm accessions to identify novel rice blast resistance genes.
