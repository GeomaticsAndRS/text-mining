Foundations of Statistics A new approach to the philosophical foundations of statistics is being developed, which builds a bridge and reaches a certain symmetry between an (extended) frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach, which clarifies problems of traditional statistics by the distinction between aleatory and epistemic probabilities and by the introduction of upper and lower probabilities, and which solves the old enigma of fiducial probabilities that has puzzled some of the best statisticians for decades. While one specific paradigm for the new approach has been completed for a limited range of problems, showing that it works in principle, there is still a number of open problems, including interpretability versus mathematical elegance, ease of applicability, asymptotic behavior, and extension to higher dimensions. There are also questions about other approaches and their relation to the present approach.
