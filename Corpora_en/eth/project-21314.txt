Hindered diffusion of bio-molecules in porous chromatographic beads. The diffusive process of bio-molecules inside porous chromatographic beads is influenced by the shrinkage of the effective pore cross-sectional area during adsorption. A model, taking into account this phenomenon, is being developed for better understanding of macromolecule diffusive behavior. Diffusion of proteins in chromatographic column is one of the crucial phenomena which control the purification process. Usually, the pore radius and the diffusion coefficient are considered constant along the pore. However, when the protein size is similar to the particle pore radius, the adsorbed proteins occupy a finite volume and can partially obstruct the pores. The aim of this PhD research project is to study the intra-particle diffusion taking into account the shrinkage of the effective pore radius during the adsorption process. Two kinds of diffusive processes are investigated: the pore diffusion of the non-adsorbed components and the surface diffusion of the adsorbed components. A model is developed based on a simple representation of the pores (cylindrical, dead end and independent pores) which fits the experimentally determined pore size distribution in the column. The pore radius and the diffusion coefficients are considered varying along the pore length and are functions of the quantity of adsorbed proteins. The diffusion aspect is further analysed in the case of a multicomponent system with competitive adsorption/ desorption processes occurring inside the pores. The model will be validated against uptake and breakthrough experiments using experimentally determined diffusional data. The project should generate new insight regarding intra-particle diffusion and on the adsorption/desorption process and will also enable to perform a better analyses of the purification processes of bio-molecules.
