On the lattice engineering of magnetoelectric coupling Magnetoelectric responses (ME) ­ that is the electric polarization created by an applied magnetic field ­ are small. Here we investigate, by first principle methods, the lattice contributions to the ME to find new routes for engineering materials with enhanced couplings. We present results of first-principles calculations of the microscopic origin of the linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect in Cr$_2$_3$. In general magnetoelectric responses ­ that is the electric polarization created by an applied magnetic field ­ are small. Since they are composed of both electronic- and lattice-mediated contributions, however, an increase in the response can in principle be achieved by phonon engineering. Here we investigate this possibility by first calculating how the magnetic interaction parameters are affected by phonon modes of different symmetry, focussing particularly on those that are active in the ME coupling. We find that the exchange interactions are most strongly modified in the non-IR active rotational phonon modes which do not contribute to the ME response. We then calculate the effect on the ME response if these phonons are disabled. Based on our results we suggest new routes for engineering materials with enhanced ME couplings.
