New apparatus for processing and thermophysical characterization of metallic glass-forming liquids In this project new equipment is developed for the processing, casting, and characterization of metallic glass-forming liquids. In particular, apparatus are developed for netshape casting of metallic glasses via superplastic forming and for measuring their thermophysical properties.
