WTP for cleaner air and trade-off between economic development and environmental quality: A case study in Mexico City By means of a single bounded, referendum-format contingent valuation elicitation, this paper finds evidence suggesting individuals trade environmental improvements for economic development when stating their willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. By means of a single bounded, referendum-format contingent valuation elicitation, this paper finds evidence suggesting individuals trade environmental improvements for economic development when stating their willingness to pay (WTP) for cleaner air. People under study live in one of the most polluted counties in Mexico City. They state their opinion on the relevance of economic development and air pollution problems. Results show WTP for cleaner air decreases when respondent poses very high priority on economic development. This result contributes to the literature on micro-foundations of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This literature has not provided convincing evidence on whether people trade economic development and environmental quality because estimation of income elasticity of demand for environmental quality has proven challenging. By gathering opinions about priority of economic development, this paper provides an alternative to test whether individuals trade environmental quality for economic development. A discussion is provided on i) why income elasticity of demand is a poor indicator of the trade-off under study, and ii) reasons behind the empirical regularity of the magnitude of income elasticity of WTP.
