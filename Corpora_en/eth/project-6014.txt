Localized Corrosion of Stainless Steels at Elevated Temperatures Localized corrosion is the main cause for failure on austenitic stainless steels. Factors influencing passivity and its breakdown at room temperature are extensively studied. However stainless steels are also used at higher temperatures. In this work the influence of the temperature on the passivity and its breakdown have been investigated in the range from 0 \dg up to 100 \dgC. Improved macro- and microelectrochemical techniques (i.e. current-density potential curves and current transient technique) will give an insight in the mechanisms of pitting and metastable pitting of stainless steels at elevated temperatures. Results have shown that the temperature is an important parameter for the dissolution kinetics of inclusions (structural inhomogeneities as weak sites) and the stability of the protective passive film.
