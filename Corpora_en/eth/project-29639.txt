High Temperature phase transition in hexagonal manganites We investigate the para-to-ferroelectric phase transition in hexagonal manganites by optical second harmonic generation at temperatures higher than 1300 K. Our goal is to identify how the ferroelectric order emerges and to clarify the phase transition properties. The hexagonal rare earth manganites h-RMnO3 (R= Sc, Y, Dy-Lu) are prototypical multiferroics, i.e. combing electric and magnetic order. h-RMnO3 features an unusual ferroelectricity which is geometrically driven and of improper nature. At around 1300 K a structural transition sets in with a tripling of the unit cell, the trimerization. In a previous work we could show that the domain structure is determined at this temperature [1]. A change in the ferroelectric polarization was observed by pyroelectric measurements at much lower temperatures of around 900 K [2]. Also data from X-ray and neutron scattering indicate a two-step process in the emergence of the ferroelectric order. A comprehensive overview over the different experimental results are summarized in [3]. But it is still under debate at which temperature the spontaneous polarization emerges, what the phase transition properties are and how the interplay between the underlying structural trimerization and the emergence of the spontaneous polarization looks like. In this project we investigate the high temperature phase transition in h-YMnO3 by optical second harmonic generation. This technique allows us to trace the strength of the ferroelectric order up to the phase transition of 1300 K and to clarify the questions above. (2013) 1. D.
