Integrated Methods for Advanced Geothermal Exploration (IMAGE) The project is funded by the EU under FP7, and involves many participating groups in Europe and within ETHZ. The focus of the work in Engineering Geology is to evaluate the possibility of constraining fracture length distributions within reservoirs from measureable stress variations and b-values.
