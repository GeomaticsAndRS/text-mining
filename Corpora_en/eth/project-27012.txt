Is fullerene a nonmetal catalyst in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene? A recent report claimed that fullerene is a nonmetal catalyst for mol. activation of hydrogen, and that its catalytic activity is comparable to that of a noble metal catalyst. The mechanism of the mol. hydrogen activation in these systems is unclear at present. a A recent report claimed that fullerene is a nonmetal catalyst for mol. activation of hydrogen, and The mechanism of the that its catalytic activity is comparable to that of a noble metal catalyst. a They also showed activated fulmol. hydrogen activation in these systems is unclear at present. a lerene (fullerene anion) to effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline, under We were interested in dark conditions and at elevated temp. and pressure, with high selectivity. a the mechanism of the mol. hydrogen activation under dark conditions and the subsequent transfer Herein, we demonstrate that C60- is of hydrogen to the substrate, and thus reproduced the expts. a To produce the active catalyst, C60 was treated with not a nonmetal catalyst for hydrogenation. a After adding THF and water, a redn. occurred solid NaOH and a Ni-Al alloy in a nitrogen atm. a The product diffused into the and a red cloud-like fullerene monoanion (C60) product formed. a After approx. 15 min, the violet THF phase THF layer, the color of which became dark violet. a The THF phase was then used for the hydrogenation of niwas sepd. from the colorless aq. soln. a Because nickel is a active hydrogenation catalyst and is used during C60- synthesis, trobenzene. a we wanted to det. whether the catalyst in the reaction was nickel.
