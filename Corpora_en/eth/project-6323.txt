Market Segments for Electric Vehicles in Europe The market for electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe can at the present time be described as rather small, but developing. In most countries electric vehicles are used only in demonstration and test related fleets. Essentially, EVs have only captured a market share with so-called pioneers. This project presents the current situation in EV representation in European countries. Our idea is that EVs must be successfully introduced in market segments before they can capture significant shares of the main market. The most promising segments for EV growth are described in terms of potential and barriers. Based on our research, marketing strategies for public and governmental agencies will be presented to promote growth of EVs. This project is part of the work which is carried out in the Programme on collaboration between CEC and National Programmes on EV in Europe which is sponsored by the European Commission (JOU2-CT94-0291).
