Secondary Structure and Dynamics of beta- and gamma-Peptides Peptides containing homologated amino acids such as beta- and gammapeptides fold into new secondary structures different from those of the natural peptides. In a close collaboration with the group of D. Seebach (Synthesis) we determine their solution structure and dynamics by NMR. see group website (Link1)
