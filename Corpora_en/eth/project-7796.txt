Developement of an object oriented CMS software simulation system Major revisions of the data handling software are required by the increased complexity and huge amount of the LHC/CMS data. A modern and flexible CMS software system based on the Object Oriented paradigm has thus to be developed. We are working on the relevant programs for the simulation of the CMS experiment within the GEANT4 environment and for the software reconstruction and analysis of CMS events. Our emphasis is especially related to the software of the electromagnetic calorimeter.
