Isolation and Determination of Procyanidin Oligomers and Polymers in Crataegus sp. More and more emphasis is put on quality control in phytopharmaceutical drugs. Selective and validated methods for the standardization of major active compounds are therefore essential. Flavonoids and procyanidin oligomers are thought to be the active principles in Crataegus sp. For the determination of O- and C-glycosides an HPLC method has recently been developed in our group. The determination of oligomeric procyanidins remains an unsolved analytical problem and is currently our research target. The determination of procyanidins is difficult because of their structural diversity (several chiral centers, oligomeric and polymeric compounds) and their instability. So far procyanidin analysis is based on conventional methods. Most commonly cyanidin is determined after acid hydrolysis. This method however lacks specifity. Currently procyanidins are being isolated from Crataegus sp. A method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of procyanidins using HPLC is being developed. As suitable modes of detection UV-DAD, electrochemistry and MS are being evaluated.
