Optimization of Emulsion Polymerization Processes Based on Coagulation Behavior of the Obtained Latexes Understand the correlations between particle surface properties and particle stability in intense flow, in order to develop polymerization processes that warrantee not only good stability during polymerization but also easy coagulation after polymerization under shear without using any electrolytes.
