Physical properties of crystal- and bubble-bearing magmas This project is an ongoing initiative to determine the rheologic and elastic properties of 3-phase magmas composed of silicate liquid, solid crystals and vapor-bearing bubbles using experimental petrology and rock deformation equipment at conditions prevailing in shallow-level magma reservoirs.
