Thixoforming of Aluminium Alloys Thixoforming is a modern casting process that permits the near net shape production of of complex shaped components combined with a high degree of productivity and reliability. Apart from these economical advantages, components produced by Thixoforming exhibit outstanding quality features. Compared with die casting and permanent mould casting a clear advantage in mechanical properties as well as in quality of forming is established. From the scientific point of view these improvements in properties are not understood till today. A profound understanding of the relation between microstructure and properties will be developed. The expected results have a scientific, an economical and a technical importance. The scientific aspect is important through the explanation of the relation between microstructure and properties of thixotropic formed parts that represents an important contribution to the research on Aluminum alloys. The aspect of political economics lies in the developmend of a process to be used successfully by the industry. The technical importance results from improved mechanical properties. Higher values of strength, fracture toughness and fatigue strength are expected, leading to parts with increased security and duration of life. This will especially evoke advantages in transport and traffic applications.
