Nondestructive Determination of the Stiffness of Materials with largeInhomogeneities Concrete and asphalt concrete are solids with large inhomogeneities. Withstructural waves whose wavelengths are larger than the characteristicdimension of the inhomogeneities, the global stiffness of the structuresare obtained nondestructively.Two different types of experiments can be performed for this purpose:In one of them a specimen is vibrating in resonance. We calculate thestiffness of the materials from the measured resonance frequencies.In the other possible type of experiment we send structural waves throughthe specimen. We measure the velocity of propagation in a rod, pipe, plateor shell. The stiffness of the materials is derived by comparing themeasured and theoretical phase velocities.Both methods were used to determine the tensile and shear moduli ofconcrete asphalt rods quite precisely.
