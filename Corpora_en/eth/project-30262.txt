Quellinhibitoren für Anhydrit führende Tonsteine The objective of this project is to determine clay-swelling inhibitors that may be incorporated in fluids used in tunneling. For this we establish a novel approach to the swelling of anhydritic claystones that separates contributions from clay swelling and anhydrite to gypsum transformation.
