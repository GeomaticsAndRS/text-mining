Engineered Streptomyces quorum-sensing components enable inducible siRNA-mediated translation control in mammalian cells and adjustable transcription control in mice Capitalizing on well-evolved quorum-sensing regulatory networks in Streptomyces coelicolor we have designed a mammalian regulation system inducible by the non-toxic butyrolactone SCB1.
