Micro EDM Drilling Process technology in EDM sinking to enable holes with small diameters lower than 3mm in difficult to cut materials. Since decades, micro EDM has been used widely for drilling applications requiring holes with diameter smaller than 3 mm because of its advantages to machine materials irrespective of its hardness with high aspect ratios, high form precision and accuracy; making it a choice of technology for automobile sector, energy and aerospace industry along with others such as biomedicine. Here, ever increasing demands from industries to improve process efficiency has to be met for various engineering materials which are difficult or in some cases impossible to machine with alternative manufacturing processes for given specifications. In order to have quicker and robust market entry of the EDM drill machine for specified interest industries, the process technology has to be avantgarde to sustain in an increasing global market competition environment, which is the main aim of this project.
