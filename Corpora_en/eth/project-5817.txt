Superoxide Dismutases in Anaerobic Bacteria Oxidative stress and therefore the occurrence of oxygen radicals (O$_{2}^{\md}$)hydroxyl radicals (OH$^{\md}$), and hydrogenperoxide (H$_{2}$_{2}$) enforced nearly all biological systems to establish detoxifying enzymes for such compounds, mainly superoxide dismutases (SODs), catalases and peroxidases. In aerobic organisms, there is evidence for the key role of SOD among such defensive enzymes. However, in some strictly anaerobic organisms, the existence of SODs was detected, but their function and regulation has to be investigated. The aim of this project is to survey the distribution of SOD activities among important anaerobic bacteria from food and human intestinal tract and to select isolates harbouring SOD activity which is regulated by oxidative stress factors. High attention will be focused on the genera Bifidobacterium and Clostridium. Regulation studies will be performed at the molecular level using isolated sod genes and their transcripts. Finally, the application of cloned sod genes as selective markers in anaerobic organisms will be investigated.
