Interfacial coupling in multiferroic - ferromagnetic heterostructures Magnetic coupling at the interface between multiferroic thin films and a ferromagnetic thin layer. An amorphus ferromagnetic layer is deposited on multiferroic magnetoelectric thin films. The interfacial magnetic exchange coupling between the two layers is locally and macroscopically probed. The scanning electron microscopy equiped with polarization analysis (SEMPA) data analysis will reveal the competition between interlayer and intralayer magnetic coupling contributions.
