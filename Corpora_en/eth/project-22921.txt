Herbivore-vegetation interactions in tall grass savannas: exploring the limits for grazers to drive landscape dynamics This project is about the grazing activity of large herbivores in humid tall-grass savanna, Tanzania. Grazing strategies of wildebeest and reedbuck are compared, and the influences of herbivores, fire and nutrients on vegetation composition and the dynamics of grazing lawns are studied. Savannas are roughly defined as continuous grass layers interspersed with tree and shrubs. The coexistence of the two life forms is dynamic and driven by well known factors such as fire and herbivores which on their part largely depend on abiotic parameters, such as rainfall patterns and nutrient availability. The aim of this project is to increase our understanding of how large herbivores are able to exist in a tall grass savannah ecosystem, and how thereby they contribute to drive vegetation dynamics. In a first approach we therefore analyses the mosaic-like patterns forming the grassy vegetation with a special focus on the intensively grazed patches (grazing lawns). In a second approach we study the grazing strategies of two species thought to represent the two ends of a gradient across the grazer community in this tall grass ecosystem, namely wildebeest (bulk grazer) and bohor reedbuck (selective grazer). The importance of fire and nutrient availability for mediating grazing intensity will be tested in a field experiment using controlled burning, cutting and fertilisation.
