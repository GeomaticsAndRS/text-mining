Analysis of the success factors of the reforestation activities on the hills of thehighlands of Central Madagascar, in particular of the difficult sites such as thosein the sphere of activity of the Programme de Foresterie et Developpement PaysansAntananarivo (Programme of Rural Reforestation and Development Antananarivo). The highlands of Central Madagascar have been the focus of important reforestation activities for several decades, in particular since the beginning of the eighties. The results have not always been convincing, so that an analysis of the situation suggested itself. The aims of the project are als follows: a) investigating different hypotheses regarding ecological issues in order to determine the principal causes of the problems by dealing more extensively with the parameters of pedology and plant nutrition b) differentiating the problems of the main species (Pinus kesiya, Eucalyptus robusta, E. camaldulensis) c) suggesting simple reforestation solutions, in particular defining the problems of the establishment of reforestation with regard to the soils. The project has an ecological focus; the technical and socio-economic questions are integrated in the issue.
