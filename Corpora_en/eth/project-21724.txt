New Spectroscopic Tools for the Detection of the Catalytically Active Sites in Heterogeneous Catalysis New spectroscopic tools are developed that enable the detection of the structure of catalytically active sites, that of adsorbates, and their interaction. The aim is to understand how catalysts function in selective hydrogenation and oxidation. The tools are based on XAS and NMR spectroscopies.
