The Functional Analysis of an ABA-Regulated ABC Transporter ABC transporters function in the movement of a wide variety of metabolites across membranes. Their role in the acquisition of multidrug resistance by bacteria, the onset of mammalian disease, and the transport of xenobiotics in plants has led to intense interest in the control and mode of action of these molecular pumps. As a result of a study of hormone- (abscisic acid, ABA) regulated gene expression in the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrrhiza, we have identified a cDNA (TUR2) encoding a novel member (PDR5-like) of the ABC superfamily. This transporter shows a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation by both hormonal and environmental effectors. The factors shown to up-regulate TUR2 expression suggest that this transporter might play an analogous function in plants to the yeast PDR5 gene in the excretion of cytotoxic factors that accumulate during growth. However, the molecular nature of the TUR2 substrate(s) and the physiological significance of their transport is as yet unknown. Our present aim is to identify and analyse TUR2-like genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and to use a molecular genetic approach to unravel their function. This includes a biochemical and physiological analysis of mutants either overexpressing or containing reduced levels of specific ABC transporters. Via this approach we aim to address the questions: is ABA regulation a general feature of this class of ABC transporters in plants? do these transporters play a general role in the growth response to stress conditions? what is nature of the endogenous molecule(s) transported?
