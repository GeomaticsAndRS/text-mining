Global population genetics and phylogeography of the rice sheath blight, maize banded leaf, and soybean aerial blight pathogen Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group 1 IA Microsatellite markers will be used to quantify genetic diversity and estimate population genetic parameters for R. solani AGI-1A populations from rice, soybeans and maize. DNA sequence loci from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes will be used to determine the center of origin of this pathogen.
