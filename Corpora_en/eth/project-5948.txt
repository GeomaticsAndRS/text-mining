Mechanisms of Receptor Desensitization Homeostasis in signal transduction frequently involves the desensitization of neurotransmitter and hormone receptors following chronic activation by an agonist. The mechanisms by which ligand-gated ion channels desensitize are largely unknown. Since activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors is relevant to the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases, their mechanism of desensitization will be analyzed as a means of affording neuroprotection. It was found that NMDA-receptors can be down-regulated not only by chronic exposure to an agonist but also by inhibition of Ca$^{2+}$-Calmodulin-Kinases. These studies point to new strategies for the regulation receptor desensitization. They promise to be of importance for therapeutic application.
