Low Pressure Metal Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy for Compound III-V Semiconductors Low-pressure metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (LP-MOVPE) is used at our institute to grow III-V compound semiconductor materials with excellent control over their structural and electrical characteristics. Amongst the various epitaxial growth techniques available for III-V semiconductors, MOVPE is the key, preferred epitaxial process due to its large throughput capabilities. Moreover, compared to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) -like environments, the realization of optoelectronic integrated circuits is facilitated due to superior regrowth properties. The epitaxial growth of a III-V compound is achieved when column III metalorganic compounds react with hydrides of the column V elements at elevated temperatures over a single-crystal substrate. MOVPE permits a fine control of layer thickness, interface structure, material composition, and impurity concentration. In addition, very thin structures can be grown for investigating quantum effects and dimensionally reduced systems are easily fabricated. Our MOVPE is equipped with six hydride lines and eight metal-organic lines and is able to satisfy the demand for a large variety of layer structures and materials. We grow Al$_{x}$_{1-x} on GaAs substrates, In$_{1-x}$_{x}$_{y}$P$_{1-y}$and InAlAs on InP substrates. These materials can be doped with Si, Sn, Zn and Fe. Virtually all III-V semiconductor devices fabricated at our institute are grown with MOVPE. This includes JFETs, HBTs, p-i-n photodiodes, lasers, semiconductor optical amplifiers, optical switches and optical filters.
