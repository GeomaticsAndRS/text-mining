Towards simulating cell adhesion sites at Angstrom resolution (SNF CSCS) Learning how mechanical forces in addition to biochemical signals co-regulate cell functions and behaviour, from migration to differentiation and ultimately apoptosis, has become feasible only recently through the availability of various nanotechnologies and of large-scale computational resources. Since tensile force can stabilize proteins in otherwise short-lived structural intermediates, deciphering how the structure-function relationship of proteins is altered by mechanical forces is prone to open totally new avenues in biotechnology, systems biology, pharmaceutics and medicine. Since experimental techniques are missing that can provide high resolution structural information about force-stabilized intermediate states, we will focus in this project on using computational tools (molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD)) to (a) learn how force is transmitted through force-bearing protein networks that connect the cell exterior via integrins to the contractile cytoskeleton, (b) gain insights into the mechanism by which force potentially activates some of the force-bearing proteins, including integrins and the scaffolding proteins that link integrins to the contractile cytoskeleton, (c) derive relative dissociation forces of critical noncovalent protein-protein contacts, and (d) determine the detailed mechanisms how these contacts brake and the role of point mutations in either reinforcing or weakening these contacts. Our longrange goal is to understand how cells sense mechanical forces and convert them into biochemical signals when adhering to surfaces from the experimental and computational perspective. We are grateful to the Swiss Super Computer Center (CSCS) for providing the necessary computational resources (CSCS-ALPS Project).
