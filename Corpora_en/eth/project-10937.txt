Structural characterization of thymidine kinases and design of new antiviral compounds Several studies dedicated to structural characterization and elucidation of thymidne kinase (TK) of different species are in progress. Aim is to supply the information needed for performing rational design of antiviral compounds interfering with key processes in virus replicative cycle.
