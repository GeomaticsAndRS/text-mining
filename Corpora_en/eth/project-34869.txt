Glycerol oxidation to dihydroxyacetone over iron zeolites The increasing amounts of glycerol obtained as the main by-product of biodiesel production is motivating the identification of viable processes for its valorization. In this project, we target the generation of C3 polymer building blocks through a high-productivity gasphase oxidationof the triol ov
