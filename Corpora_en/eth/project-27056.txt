Protein level regulation by the ubiquitin proteasome system and in different leaf cell types Protein levels are determined at transcriptional, translational and posttranslational levels. In this project we will study protein level regulation by the ubiquitin proteasome system with proteasome inhibition and affinity purification under different conditions and in different leaf cell types.
