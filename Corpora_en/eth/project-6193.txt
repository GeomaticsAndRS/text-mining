Numerical Modelling of Rockfall Protection Systems The nets of todays rockfall protection systems consist of flexible and loosely connected steel-wire rings. Steel posts and cables support the net and deforming brake elements dissipate the rock's energy which results into a overall energy capacity of up to 3000kJ. Due to the increasing costs of full-scale field tests a computational simulation of the protection system provides a convenient method for optimizing the development of systems with higher energy capacities. A special purpose finite element application is capable to simulate the brake-down process of the rockfall event as well as the loads of the single components of the barrier. The validation process of the finite element simulation takes place by the comparison and with the results of quasi-static laboratory tests and full-scale dynamic field experiments.
