CPMAS spectroscopy applied to uniformly C-13, N-15 labelled proteins In recent years, much progress has been made in the field of protein structure determination by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution liquid-state NMR spectroscopy. Still, large classes of proteins cannot be investigated with these methods because either the proteins cannot be crystallized to a sufficient crystal size for X-ray diffraction, or they cannot be brought into a sufficiently concentrated solution for liquid-state NMR. Therefore there is a considerable interest in the development of methods for protein structure determination which do not have these limitations. High-resolution solid-state NMR is a promising technique in this respect. So far, most studies have employed selective isotope labeling of the proteins under investigation. For practical purposes, however, it would be desirable to have tools at hand with which it is possible to extract structural information directly from uniformly isotope-enriched samples. In the last few years, a whole arsenal of such tools has been developed by several groups all over the world. We are currently applying, evaluating and improving these methods on uniformly 13C-, 15N-labelled peptides and intermediate-size proteins. Examples include the decapeptide antamanide and the alpha-spectrin SH3 domain (62 amino acids).
