Functional analysis of ribosome assembly factors in eukaryotes Large macro-molecular assemblies exert their function in a variety of cellular pathways. One such assembly is the ribosome that is composed of rRNA and ribosomal proteins and carries out the activity of protein synthesis. In eukaryotes, the highly dynamic process of constructing this large ribonucleo-protein complex that begins in the nucleolus, is poorly understood at the molecular level. Recent proteomic approaches in budding yeast have unraveled >200 proteins termed as transacting factors that aid the formation of the ribosomal subunits. Despite the plethora of factors that have been identified, our knowledge about their spatial and temporal role(s) in promoting ribosomal subunit maturation is rudimentary. Employing the powerful combination of genetic, cell biological and biochemical methods in yeast, we aim to unravel parts of the blueprint for eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. Such analysis will lead to deciphering design-principles that underlie the assembly/disassembly of large dynamic macromolecular complexes.
