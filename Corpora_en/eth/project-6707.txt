General Insurance Risk Processes Risk processes are becoming increasingly important in applications in insurance and finance. In this project we investigate risk processes where the intensity is driven by economic factors. The loss distributions are assumed to be heavytailed. The classical risk process consists of a deterministic (often linear) premium income process and a stochastic (typically compound Poisson) claim process. The inclusion of economic factors like inflation, dividend payments, reinsurance, borrowing, stochastic interest rates, etc. lead to mathematically more complicated models. These models are investigated from a probabilistic as well as statistical point of view. A key question concerns the statistical estimation of the Lundberg (or adjustment) coefficient if the latter exists. Also the numerical calculation of analytic bounds and/or asymptotic estimates lead to interesting methodological questions, especially in the large claim case. The results obtained so far concern ruin estimation when an extra stable component is introduced in the classical model, the applications of resampling methods (bootstrap, Jacknife) for the estimation of the Lundberg coefficient and the use of piecewise deterministic Markov processes for analysing general risk processes.Further extensions include models where the intensity is modelled by a Markovian process driven by endogenous economic factors. This leads to applications of time chsnge methodology. Applications include credit risk and operational risk, the latter in the context of the Basel II proposals.
