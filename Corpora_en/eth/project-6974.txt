Optimized knowledge transfer from science to public by the example of gene technology The goal of this project is to develop a concept of an optimized knowledge transfer from science to school in order to promote the pupils' capability of rationally based judgement. A technology assessment study (TA-study) represents an ideal source for this purpose because it includes a variety of information, all referring to one special topic. However, a TA-study is very complex and demanding in its original form. It therefore has to be rewritten in order to be used in class. A suitable format would be a case study. A current problem in public discussion is the safety of transgenic organisms. A TA-study on this topic referring to Genetically modified disease- and pathogen resistant plants was edited by BATS in 1996. This TA-study was chosen as a basis for constructing a special kind of case study, a TA-case study. The TA-case study will be tested in class for its capacity to promote critical thinking and profound, rational argumentation more than it is the case with traditional teaching. The target group will be pupils of a final-year class of a secondary school.
