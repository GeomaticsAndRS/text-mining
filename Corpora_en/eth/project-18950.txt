General Equilibrium Theory and Group Formation In this project, we analyze general equilibrium models with multi-member groups using three interacting mechanisms, each operating at a particular level of aggregation. Individual decisions are made to join or leave groups. In this project, we analyze general equilibrium models with multi-member groups using three interacting mechanisms, each operating at a particular level of aggregation. Individual decisions are made to join or leave groups. Collective decisions within groups determine the consumption plans of group members. Competitive exchange across groups achieves a feasible allocation of resources. We study the effects of these interdependencies in the context of households and firms.
