Supramolecular Nanosystems 1. Dynamic receptors undergoing conformational switching (T, pH, Zn(II)) betw. vase form (guest complexation in deep cavity) and kite form (large flat surface). 2. Dendritic iron porphyrins as reversible O2-binders. 3. Self-assembling amphiphilic dendrimers as transfection agents for gene delivery.
