Biocompatible Austenitic Stainless Steels without Nickel for Application to theHuman Body Allergic reaction to nickel containing alloys has become a serious medical problem in industrialized countries. The goal of the research project is the development of biocompa-tible and therefore nickel-free, corrosion-resistant, tough, non-magnetic alloys for application at and in the human body. The basic materials are austenitic iron-base alloys with high chromium, high molybdenum and high nitrogen contents. The development of such materials requires a precise metallurgical knowledge of the joint action of all alloying elements, primarily to avoid the precipitation of intermetallic phases which not only embrittle the alloys but also promote corrosion. Moreover, embrittlement by cleavage cracking has to be avoided by appropriate alloy element concentrations. Processing and production of the new alloys will is performed by using high pressure electro-slag remelting or powder metallurgy (HIP, Powder Injection Moulding). The research program evaluates the optimum processing routes.
