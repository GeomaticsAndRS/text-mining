Improved Phosphorus Resource efficiency in Organic agriculture Via recycling and Enhanced biological mobilization (IMPROVE-P) Phosphorus (P) from urban areas and the food industry needs to be recycled to the cropland of organic farms. We will study the plant use efficiency of recycled P fertilizers and test agronomic measures to improve their P availability by e.g., plant mechanisms and Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria
