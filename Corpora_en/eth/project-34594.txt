THiGER: Thermoelectric microgenerators based on silicon nanowire arrays for powering micro/nanodevices In this project, bottom-up silicon nanowire arrays will be integrated vertically in top-down microstructures to fabricate silicon-based thermoelectric generators. This novel thermoelectric material opens new ways for compatibly integrating thermoelectric generators into silicon microtechnology.
