Composition, Structure and Development of a Formerly Used Rain Forest on theSandy Coasts of Eastern Madagascar In a small forest near Fenoarivo we are fortunate in the possession of a long row of data concerning location and range of earlier exploitation. The aim of this project is to ascertain the present composition and forest structure and to analyse the same with the help of information on exploitation. An exact description of regeneration processes will allow us to propose methods to achieve a sustainable yield production.
