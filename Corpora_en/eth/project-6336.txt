Systems Ergonomics - The FIT-System: A tool for mobile computerised data collection The FIT-System (Flexible Interface Template) is a new technique (pat. pend.) for event recording with small, handheld computer devices. Event recording means a form of data collection, where an observer wants to analyse processes in a dynamic system (such as work systems). It is one of the basic analysis methods in Ergonomics and Design. The intention of the FIT-System is to overcome some of the fundamental difficulties humans have in understanding and using computer applications. Therefore the users of the FIT-System can design their own interface matching their mental model and without any human-computer interaction. The advantages of this technique are the fast interaction mode and the high usability and variability for different applications. The FIT-System works with the Apple-Newton and the 3Com PalmPilot devices. Further development is the synchronous registration of noise levels or other analog sensor signals. This will allow to use the FIT-System in long-term field studies and to scan or detect subjective annoyance of noise emissions. News of this project are presented at www.SmileDesign.ch
