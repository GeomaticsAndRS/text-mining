SIMGIS - GIS for thermal simulations in the built environment Building simulation programs perform thermal simulations in a standalone scenario and can't handle a broad scenario of environmental changes. Target of the project is to develop a methodology to optimize building thermal performances by coupling GIS, simulation and on line meteorological data.
