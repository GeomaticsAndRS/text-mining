Concepts and Experiments Towards a Tunable Mid-infrared External Cavity Diode LaserSystem for Environmental Sensing Laser spectroscopy for environmental monitoring is a well known technique. For the midinfrared range, however, simple and compact tunable laser sources are rare and more sophisticated solutions are needed. In the frame of the Swiss priority program OPTIQUE we have been working towards a system the main parts of which are two tunable external cavity diode lasers (ECL) around 1.3 and 1.55 \gmm, respectively, and the non-linear crystal AgGaSe$_{2}$in a way such as to obtain difference frequency (DFG). By using two tunable diode lasers we expect to cover with this method the wavelength range around 8 \gmm. We have realized ECLs tunable over several tens of nanometers. The maximum power that was coupled in to a single-mode fiber, however, is limited to about 1 mW in fiber whereas the stability and tunability deteriorates at higher power levels. Since the DFG is expected to have low conversion efficiency, we have been searching for possibilities of amplification of the diode emission. We have measured the overall performance of a external cavity diode laser in combination of a Erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and obtained up to 10 mW in the fiber. DFG experiments are in progress.
