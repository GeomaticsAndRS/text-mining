Methodological Pitfalls of Scenario Analyses in Energy Planning For decades long range forecasts have been playing an important role in public planning. Energy and transportation planning are perhaps the most well known. Scenario analysis is one useful method for the elaboration of long range planning perspectives. This method is used especially when uncertainties are high and when the relationship between the influence factors cannot be described in quantitative terms alone. Many methods for scenario creation have been developed since the fifties when the term scenario was introduced for the first time into scientific language. The possibility to make use of both qualitative and quantitative data is regularly mentioned as an advantage of this method. However, the relationship between these two sets of data as well as the possibilities for integrating them have so far not been analyzed thoroughly. Energy planning in Switzerland has made use of scenarios already for decades. However, the specific applications have not always reflected the essential features of the method of scenario analysis. The aim of this study is to use three cases from the Swiss energy planning history of the last dirty years to discuss possibilities and limits of the method scenario analysis in energy planning.
