Photorefractive ferroelectrics for photonics and optoelectronics In this project we investigate light-sensitive ferroelectric materials for realtime laser beam wavefront and spectral manipulation and light-induced dynamic optical switching and steering. Photorefractive materials present a special group of nonlinear optical materials that operate already at moderate light intensity levels, which is possible due to their unique combination of photoconductive and electro-optic properties. In such materials, the excitation of charges induced by light creates an internal electric field, which, in turn, initiates an electro-optic effect that alters the optical properties of the medium. Thus, the optical properties of the medium are indirectly controlled by light incident on it. The possibility of controlling light by light in a photorefractive medium gives rise to a number of interesting effects that enable for example volume holographic optical memories or dynamic holography for optical data processing, including image amplification, the removal of image aberrations, cross correlation of images, optical switching, filtering... Our research in this field is focused on one hand on the development of suitable nonlinear optical materials and on the investigations of the involved physical processes, and on the other hand on real-time laser beam wavefront and spectral manipulation, and light-induced dynamic optical switching and steering devices.
