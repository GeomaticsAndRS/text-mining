Fast Track Trigger for the H1 experiment The HERA collider was upgrade to provide higher luminosity in the period 2000 to 2003. Within this context, the H1-Experiment needed to expand its trigger capabilities in particular for events displaying characteristic track signatures such as charm and bottom quark production. This has been done by building a so-called Fast Track Trigger (FTT). The goal of the FTT is the fast on-line reconstruction of charged particles, which enables particle identification at the earliest possible trigger levels before events are fully reconstructed. The FTT consists of three stages, called L1, L2, L3 according to the trigger levels at which they are active and form trigger decisions. Such an ambitious task has become possible due to achievements in modern electronic designs using high density programmable circuits, such as programmable gate arrays (FPGA), integrating millions of gates on single chips. The FTT L2 design and development were performed by the ETH in cooperation with the company Supercomputing Systems (SCS) in Zuerich which signed mainly responsible for the construction of the hardware. The FTT trigger levels L1 and L2 have been fully operational since 2005, and serve as standard H1 track trigger elements.
