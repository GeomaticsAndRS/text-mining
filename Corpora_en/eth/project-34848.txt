Evolutionary diversification and changes in host-plant selection by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Characterize perceptual and behavioral aspects of host-plant selection by larvae and adults of three subspecies of the Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar asiatica, L. dispar japonica, and L. dispar dispar) and elucidate evolutionary changes associated with reduced female dispersal in the Europ. subspecies
