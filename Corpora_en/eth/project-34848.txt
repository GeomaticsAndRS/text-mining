Evolutionary diversification and changes in host-plant selection by gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). Characterize perceptual and behavioral aspects of host-plant selection by larvae and adults of three subspecies of the Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar asiatica, L. dispar japonica, and L. dispar dispar) and elucidate evolutionary changes associated with reduced female dispersal in the Europ. subspecies The Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), a generalist herbivore that feeds on a broad range of trees and shrubs, is one of the most devastating invasive forest pests world- wide. This species appears to be undergoing evolutionary diversification, and at present there are three recognized subspecies: The Asian Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar asiatica), the Japanese Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar japonica) and the European Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar). While European Gypsy moth females are flightless, Asian and Japanese females can fly and disperse over extended distances. This may, in turn, have implications for host-plant principle, female herbivores frequently selection. According to the so-called Smother ¸ knows bestT provide a degree of parental care by selecting host plants that are well suited to the development of their, relatively sedentary, offspring. The evolution of flightless females might thus be expected to entail a reduction in parental investment and perhaps increased selection pressure on larval stages to discriminate among potential hosts. The gypsy moth system thus provides an ideal model in which to study changes in perceptual and behavioral aspects of host-plant selection by both adults and larvae in an evolutionary context. Furthermore, improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying host-choice for this invasive species may aid to the development of new control methods.
