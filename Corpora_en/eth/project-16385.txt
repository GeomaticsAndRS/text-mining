Monte Carlo algorithms for lattice field theories We devise and test more efficient algorithms for the numerical simulation of field theories discretized on a lattice, with a particular interest in theories containing fermions. Numerical simulation is an established method to study non-perturbative properties of field theories. The theory is discretized on a regular lattice, and Monte Carlo algorithms are used to select, among all possible lattice field configurations, a representative sample. The computer expense required to obtain such a sample grows as the size of the system is increased (thermodynamic limit), as the lattice spacing is reduced (continuum limit). Further difficulties arise when the theory includes fermions, since they anticommute and cannot be directly simulated. These difficulties are compounded when the fermion mass is reduced (chiral limit). We try to address the slowing down of simulations in these three limits. We have had particular success so far in the simulations of interfaces ("snake" algorithm) and in the acceleration of fermionic simulations ("Rational Hybrid Monte Carlo" and multiple time-scales).
