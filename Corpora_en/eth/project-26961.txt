Spectroscopy, Quantum Dynamics and Electroweak Parity Violation in Chiral Molecules The PI and his group have in theoretical and preparatory experimental efforts approached one of the most fundamental questions of molecular physics, concerning the role of parity violation in chiral molecules, with consequences for physical stereochemistry. The project is on this problem.
