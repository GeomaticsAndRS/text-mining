Preparation of the Higgs search at the LHC The discovery of the Higgs boson in the mass range between 100 GeV and about 1 TeV is the major goal of the LHC program. An optimal preparation for the Higgs search over this mass range requires not only the necessary experimental possibilities of the CMS detector but also optimal analysis strategies. We are working on the optimal exploitation of various detectable Higgs signatures over the entire mass range. Work for the well established signatures like the four charged lepton final states and the Higgs decay to two photons concentrates now on the optimization of signal to background ratios with highest possible efficiencies. These clean signatures suffer however from the low cross sections. It is thus mandatory for an optimal Higgs search strategy to exploit also other less clean channels like the decay to W or Z boson pairs with their subsequent decays into two charged leptons and two undetectable neutrinos. We have recently shown that for example the Higgs decay to WW provides an excellent discovery signature in the previously almost detection gap region between 155-180 GeV. We are now working on a strategy on how this signature can be exploited over a much larger mass range. Due to the lower expected Higgs rate at masses above 500 GeV signatures involving hadronic W and Z decays are considered as important additional channels. However, the possible sensitivity of such decays is still not well known.
