Gene flow, virulence and evolutionary potential of the ash dieback pathogen Chalara fraxinea We study gene flow, virulence and evolutionary potential of the new ash dieback pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph: Chalara fraxinea) and its presumably non-pathogenic sister species Hymenoscyphus albidus. Gene flow, virulence and evolutionary potential of the ash dieback pathogen Chalara fraxinea The mitosporic fungus Chalara fraxinea (teleomorph: Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus) causes an emerging lethal disease of ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior, F. angustifolia) in large parts of Europe. In addition, a very similar presumably non-pathogenic species, Hymenoscyphus albidus, occurs in Europe. The biology of C. fraxinea is only very superficially known and the origin of its pathogenicity is completely enigmatic. We hypothesize that an invasive cryptic species, hybridization of the endemic fungus with an introduced species or a novel mutation can explain the epidemic. Currently, the epidemic front is moving through Switzerland. This provides the unique opportunity to analyze the structure of the pathogen population at the epidemic front and to compare the invading fungus with its presumed non-pathogenic sister species. In addition, we envisage to unravel the mating system of the pathogen. This will significantly contribute to our understanding of the processes, which are driving this highly destructive tree disease. Knowing the evolutionary context of virulence emergence in C. fraxinea is an essential prerequisite for the development of disease control techniques and conservation strategies for ash trees.
