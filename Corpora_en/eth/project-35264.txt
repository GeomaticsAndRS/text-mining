Hyperelastic Hybride Membrane For Biomimetic Blood Propulsion Project is dealing with the development of an implantable single-ventricular pump based on a hyperelastic hybrid membrane. Objective is to design, fabricate, control and validate a blood propulsion device based on pulsatile hybrid membrane, made of an endothelial cell layer with a highly deformable synthetic substrate. The challenge lies in designing and realizing a viable concept that minimizes the in-plane deformation and wall shear stress (WSS) in the hyperelastic hybrid membrane, while fulfilling the main task of the pump, namely to ensure the perfusion of the supported patient. Dynamic finite element models of the pump and the blood are created and employed to first analyze and then minimize these parameters by adapting the pump geometry based on representative boundary conditions and actuation strategies. Thereby, a fluid structure interaction (FSI) model will be established. Control oriented zero-dimensional models will be used to investigate the effect of the actuation strategy on the membrane mechanical loading as well as for an optimization of this strategy.
