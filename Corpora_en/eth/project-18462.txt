Suitability of IBM/Sony CELL processors for scientific work This computational science project test the suitability of IBM/Sony CELL processors for scientific work. Begun in late 2006 it is a collaboration of ETH Zurich, the University of Zurich, and the company qubits (see http://cluster.qubits.ch/ ). - The main objective of our project is to build a cost-effective cell prototype cluster for scientific computing out of eight Playstation 3 (PS3) consoles. - We want to learn how to code and to optimize the Cell for scientific applications, e.g. we intend to implement elements of a MPI based parallel-parallel BLAS (sparse/dense) library on it. - The experiences of this project will enter into a potential study for an upscaling of such a cluster. - Experiences and code are portable to a future Cell based cluster (out of IBM Cell Blade Servers or similar).
