Elasticity Coefficients of Existing and Future Metric Gauge Track Systems Today there is practically no knowledge about values of the elasticity coefficients of metric gauge tracks. Of 1435 mm gauge tracks there is also only a small number of publications on this matter. It is planned to measure a number of elasticity coefficients on different types of existing track structures on Swiss metric railways (36 kg and 46 kg rails; concrete, wooden and steel sleepers; different soil structures). The measurements are planned with defined train compositions with different axle loads to find correlations axle load and elasticity coefficients.
