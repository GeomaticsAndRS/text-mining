Erm√ºdungsverhalten von kreuzweise bewehrten Stahlbetonplatten | Fatigue Performance of Orthogonally Reinforced Concrete Slabs The fatigue behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs will be investigated in a series of fatigue tests. The progression of the fatigue damage mechanism will be monitored with emphasis on the detection of individual reinforcing bar fractures by non-destructive testing methods.
