Ion-Selective Electrodes for Trace Analysis The lower detection limits and selectivities of polymeric membrane ionselective electrodes (ISEs) have been improved by many orders of magnitude. Rugged systems are being developed for environmental monitoring of different ions including Pb2+ , Cu2+, Cd2+, and Àù at trace levels. ClO4U
