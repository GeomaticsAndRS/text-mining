Scaling behavior of topologically protected ferroelectric vortices in hexagonal manganites We investigate the scaling behavior of topologically protected ferroelectric vortices in hexagonal manganites by performing annealing experiments and subsequent ferroelectric domain imaging by piezoresponse force microscopy. The hexagonal rare earth manganites h-RMnO3 (R = Sc, Y, Dy-Lu) are prototypical multiferroics, i.e. combing electric and magnetic order. h-RMnO3 features an unusual ferroelectricity which is geometrically driven and of improper nature. The ferroelectric domain structure reveals this unusual driving mechanism by the occurrence of ferroelectric vortices, intersections of six individual domains with alternating orientation of the polarization [1,2]. Local poling experiments showed that these vortices cannot be erased under the influence of an electric field [1] and are therefore topologically protected. In this project we study the formation of these ferroelectric vortices by cooling across the phase ~ transition at 1300 K with varying cooling rates and subsequent imaging of the ferroelectric domain structure by piezoresponse force microscopy [3]. The observed scaling behavior is interpreted by a theory of topological defect formation, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism [4], which is also applied to topological defect formation in the early universe. Thus the ferroelectric domain formation in h-RMnO3 allows us to take a deeper look into the general phenomenon of topological defect formation. 1. T. Jungk et al., Appl. Phys.
