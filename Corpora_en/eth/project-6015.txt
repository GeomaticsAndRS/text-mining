STM Characterization of Passive Alloy Surfaces and Tapping Mode ScanningElectrochemical Microscopy (TSECM) The formation of protective oxy-hydroxide films (passive films) on stainless steel DIN 1.4301 has been studied by in-situ STM and AFM techniques. During active corrosion in the prepassive region the metal is not dissolved uniformly. STM images show spots of about 500 nm starting to dissolve (high substrate current). After some time the corrosion process stops and another spot becomes active. This leads to an overall macroscopic uniform loss of metal. Studies on pure iron in borate buffer solutions show that a thin passive layer is formed on the surface at low passivation potentials which lowers the tunneling barrier by inducing localized states. dI/ds and dF/ds spectroscopy can detect inclusions in stainless steels DIN 1.4301 and DIN 1.4529 down to a size of 10 nm. A decreasing total sulfur content in the steel leads to smaller inclusions. In these stainless steels a large amount of extremely fine inclusions was discovered. As a methodical extension of the work mentioned above we are combining electrochemical and scanning probe technology. In a startup phase we are constructing a scanning probe head containing a thin glass capillary with a diameter in the range of one micrometer or even below rather than a conventional tip for electron tunneling or scanning force microscopy. Such tips will both be used either for local electrochemical experiments or lithographic deposition processes. Operating the glass capillary in the tapping mode (TSECM) enables us to use the glass capillary as a miniaturized electrochemical cell in order to determine corrosion effects of single material inhomogeneities at the surface of metals and alloys.
