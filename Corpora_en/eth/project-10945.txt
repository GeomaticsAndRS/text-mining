Development of new screening methods for studying metabolism at molecular level and predict metabolic pattern early during the drug discovery process The aim is the development of new methods for studying metabolism at molecular level that will allow to efficiently screen large number of compounds and create the basis for a homogenous set of metabolic data to icrease prediction during early phase of drug development.
