Metaproteogenomics of phyllosphere microbiota We combine ultra high throughput DNA sequencing technology and portein identificatioan by shotgun proteomics to entire bacteria phyllosphere communities in situ. Identification of proteins will shed light on general adaptation mechanism of the commensal microbiota on plants.
