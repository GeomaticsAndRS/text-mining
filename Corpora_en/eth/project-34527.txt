SCCER: Future Energy Efficient Buildings Districts (FEEBD): Active Building Management Advanced predictive control will be used to develop strategies for improving building efficiency while maintaining occupant comfort. Cooperative optimisation methods will be used to manage energy (via electrical, gas and hot water grids) in collection of buildings - referred to as an Energy Hub Active Building Energy Management in modern buildings is facing significant new opportunities and chal- lenges regarding energy efficiency. The energy supply options have increased with the introduction of renew- ables and the possibility of cooperative energy management within energyhubs. Significant efficiency gains can be envisaged but require sophisticated control systems that can handle the variability in energy prices, supplies and reliability in the presence of operational uncertainties, such as weather and occupancy. Ad- vanced predictive building control technologies to address this problem are only at the initial demonstration stage: the fundamentals of highly efficient building control systems have been demonstrated at the office building scale, showing up to 20-30% yearly energy savings for space heating. To advance the technology to the product stage requires a much broader consideration of uncertainty and flexibility.
