Planar Antenna with Fiber Optic Link In optical subcarrier multiplexed (SCM) transmission links, the current of the transmitting laser diode is modulated by various microwave or UHF carriers. Therefore it is essential to understand the nonlinear distortion and noise behavior of the laser diodes used in these links. A Volterra-Wiener model based on the carrier-photon rate equations has been derived to calculate analytically the second and third order harmonic and intermodulation distortions. The model is the most complete known of its kind and includes spectral/spatial hole burning effects, spontaneous emission and external optical feedback. The theory has successfully been verified experimentally over a large range of modulation frequencies. Various types of lasers have been characterized and classified with respect to their usefulness in fiber optic SCM links. A study of intermodulation distortions caused by many arbitrary placed carriers in Natel C and D channels has been made. The carrier placement has been optimized using a genetic algorithm. Laser diode test mounts and matching networks have been developed. To investigate the differences between single and multimode lasers with respect to nonlinearities and noise, phase-sensitive (field-) and phase-insensitive (photon-) multimode rate equations including cross saturation and internal scattering effects are studied using numerical methods and circuit simulators (time and frequency domain). Kinks and hard limiting laser nonlinearities are analyzed as well. A compensator for laser nonlinearities with an C/IM increase of 20dB..30dB has been developed. FM schemes for fiber optic links to minimize the nonlinear distortions are studied theoretically using the Volterra-Wiener theory of nonlinear systems. New laser types and techniques applicable to fiber optic links to minimize noise and nonlinearities are being studied.
