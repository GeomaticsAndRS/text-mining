Ecological and evolutionary significance of size in planktic protists Part II We study size variability in today≈†s major shell-forming oceanic plankton groups and link these characters to the genetics of living species. In sediments we then test their response to the last global warm period ca. 3 million years ago, the most recent analog to the future warm climate.
