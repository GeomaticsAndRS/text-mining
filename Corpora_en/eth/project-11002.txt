Low-cost sensors for single use Bioreactors (LoCoSens) The continuous control of nutrients in small scale bioreactors is of high importance. Based on investigations of miniaturized screen-printed amperometric electrodes for ß-D-glucose and L-lactate, CCS focused on immobilization of oxidases and on chemical modification of the matrix. The continuous control of nutrients in small scale bioreactors where highly valued products such as 3-dimensional cell cultures are cultivated is of high importance. Traditionally, pH, oxygen and CO2 are controlled as secondary indicators of cell growth. The objective of this project was to develop glucose- and lactate-selective sensors to monitor these primary indicators of cell metabolism. alfa-D-glucose is the main C-source for most cell cultures whereas L-lactate is an end product of the metabolism which influences buffer capacity and lastly the pH of the medium. CCS has a fundamental long-term experience with the investigation of amperometric, enzymatic and mediator-catalyzed sensors. The requirements of such sensors to be implanted into bioreactors are: 1. dynamic range of 1 to 100 mM 2. response time <30 s; 3. operating lifetime of two weeks; 4. sterile after production; 5. no cell toxicity; 6. comparably low prize. Based on previous investigations of miniaturized screen-printed electrodes, CCS focused on immobilization of the enzyme and on chemical modification of the matrix incorporating the mediator. The correlastion between alfa-D-glucose and cell growth was shown. Toxicity studies showed no influence of the sensor matrix on cell growth. Investigation are ongoing.
