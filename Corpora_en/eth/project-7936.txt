Order-Parameter Symmetry of the Heavy Electron Superconductor UPt3 There has been a great deal of speculation about the correct superconducting order parameter for the heavy electron superconductor UPt$_{3}$. The presence of several superconducting phase transitions and antiferromagnetism indicates that the appropriate order parameter may be unconventional and complex. The crystal symmetry combined with transport measurement probing the gap anisotropy have narrowed the candidates down to the even parity E$_{2u}$ representations. Unfortunately, at this time no phase sensitive tunnelling measurements have been performed to directly probe the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter of this material. As a natural extension of our work on probing the order parameter symmetry of the cuprate superconductors, we intend to perform similar experiments on UPt$_{3}$. The primary challenge in these experiments will be to conclusively demonstrate the Josephson effect between a conventional superconductor and UPt$_{3}$. We have developed and custom built a magnetically shielded He$^{3}$cryostat to perform these experiments at temperatures below 1 K. This cryostat contains mechanical feedthroughs to enable Josephson point contact measurements. If Josephson supercurrents are indeed obtained, further experiments involving directional tunnelling into single crystal UPt$_{3}$> and eventually phase sensitive tunnelling (DC-SQUID) measurements between appropriate combinations of junctions will be performed. We anticipate that the results of these experiments will contribute greatly to the understanding of the mechanism of superconductivity in these materials.
