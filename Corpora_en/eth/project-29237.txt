ESA CCI Clouds Project The ultimate objective of Cloud CCI is to provide long-term coherent cloud property data sets by exploiting the capabilities of different Earth observation missions. This project seeks to utilize the increasing potential of the synergic capabilities of past, existing and upcoming European and US satellite missions in order to meet the increasing needs for coherent long-term cloud property datasets required by the scientific community. Within this project, ETH is using this data to validate and improve high-resolution cloud-resolving climate models.
