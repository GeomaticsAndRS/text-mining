ASREM (Advanced Sensor Research for Environmental Monitoring) The project is aimed at developing optical sensors applicable to the needs of the European water industry. Stringent environmental controls require cheap and robust in situ monitoring instrumentation for a range of different determinands such as oxygen, pH, ammonia, trace metals, organic chlorinated and aromatic compounds and several anions. So far, optical solvent polymeric membranes containing ionophores which are selective for trace metals, several anions and cations had been developed. For calibration of those optode membranes, the Pitzer calculus is used to estimate the activity coefficients of electrolytes in mixed solutions. In continuous flow systems, the detection limit of these membranes lies in the nmolar or ppb (5g l$^{-1}$) range. The selectivity required for landfill and groundwater was shown to be unsufficient since the copper concentration exceeds the concentration of heavy metals (Pb$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$) by a factor of 50 to 100 in these specimens. A concept to get rid of the copper interference by complexation or reduction of Cu$^{2+}$was made in line with a concept for the development of new ionophores. The synthesis of a first sample of such an ionophore was started.
