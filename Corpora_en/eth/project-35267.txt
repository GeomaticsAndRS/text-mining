Efficient Technologies and Systems for Mobility This project aims at developing knowledge and technologies essential for the transition to sustainable transportation systems, focusing in particular on the minimization of the energy demand by reducing vehicle mass with novel, recyclable high performance thermoplastics composites. This research is in the field of high volume lightweight thermoplastic composites. Promising processing routes will be evaluated based on scientific, environmental and economic criteria. We investigate the direct consolidation of fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites based on novel approaches on hybridization and commingling . With regard to mass production, press-forming technologies represent a promising processing route. On the one hand press forming technologies are a common standard for other materials as well, on the other hand they offer the possibility to produce lightweight structural parts without the penalty of long production cycle times and high process costs. In this context, novel yarn technologies possess the potential to fill the existing gap along the value chain, between the constituent materials and the manufacturing step.
