A Web-based Infrastructure for the Internet of Things This project investigates approaches to provide a management architecture for the integration, description, discovery, and lookup of smart devices. Based on such an infrastructure, clients will be able to find and utilize services and to integrate device functionality within physical mashups. The Web of Things is a concrete implementation of the Internet of Things vision that focuses on establishing application-level connectivity between heterogeneous devices based on protocols and patterns that have proven to be successful in the World Wide Web. This development of integrating and connecting sensors and actuators within a single Web-based network generates substantial added value by opening up new interaction possibilities between static documents, smart items, software applications, and human users. It brings with it the ability to manage real-world processes in real time and in an automated manner that reacts and adapts to events in the physical world. Given the high number of devices that we expect to be integrated into this Web of Things within the next few years and their communication requirements, in this project, we will investigate approaches to provide a management architecture that will support the integration, description, discovery, and lookup of smart devices and their associated services. This system will include a mechanism to allow physical things to provide semantic descriptions on the data and functionality they offer. Utilizing a search engine that is based on such descriptions, human users as well as machines will be able to find and utilize relevant items and services on demand and - given a service composition frontend - will be able to integrate information and functionality of devices within physical-virtual mashups.
