Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy of unstable species Pulsed jet Fourier transform (FT) microwave spectroscopy is a very high resolution spectroscopic technique that is particularly suited to the study of unstable species. In this method, samples are introduced into the probe region of the spectrometer through a supersonic expansion of a gas-phase sample entrained in an inert gas flow. Thus, highly reactive species, such as free radicals, created in or immediately after the pin-hole nozzle used in the expansion are stabilized in the nearly collision-free environment of the molecular jet long enough for their FT microwave spectra to be recorded. Analysis of these spectra can yield not only information about the geometry of a molecule through an analysis of the positions of the rotational transitions, but also information about the magnetic and/or electric fields surrounding non-zero spin nuclei through the analysis of hyperfine splittings of the rotational transitions. Thus, insight into the nature of the molecular structures, bonding, and nuclear shielding parameters for these unstable species can be obtained. Methods for preparing these unstable species in situ include the use of electric discharges, and the use of lasers. For several years now we have been using electric discharges to successfully prepare a variety of unstable species for FT microwave spectroscopic study. This techique has proved to be very effective, but suffers from the drawback that it is not at all specific. Laser photolysis, on the other hand, offers the possibility to very specifically cleave certain bonds in an appropriate precursor, thus providing a very clean source of molecules of interest. Experiments to develop an effective and reliable laser photolysis sample preparation source are currently underway. Reference: B. Brupbacher-Gatehouse, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122 (2000) 4171.
