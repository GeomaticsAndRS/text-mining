Non-destructive Techniques to Assess Corrosion Rate of Steel in Concrete Maintenance, planning of the restoration work, quality control and the evaluation of structure live cycle-cost need rapid, non-destructive field test methods for locating corroding zones as well as for measuring the corrosion rate of reinforcing steel in concrete structures. A few commercial devices based on electrochemical linear polarization technique are available today. During this research work a very rapid new technique, galvanostatic pulse measurements (GPM), has been developed and tested succesfully in the laboratory and on site. Experimental data from on-site measurements have shown that in the frequent case of chloride induced, localized corrosion attacks the average corrosion rates determined from electrochemical measurements under-estimate the real, local penetration rates by a factor of five to ten. From an engineering point of view such local reduction in cross section of the rebars are dangerous for the safety of structures. In this project a new approach to measure experimentally localized and not average corrosion rates shall be tested in the laboratory on artificial macro-cells and compared to the traditional techniques. Numerical simulations with a network will help to develop the algorithm for calculation of the local corrosion rates. Finally on-site measurements with the new technique will be performed.
