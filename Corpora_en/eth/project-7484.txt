Thermodynamic Properties of Aqueous Solutions Fundamental thermodynamic data for solutions containing aqueous electrolyte and neutral species are of importance in a variety of natural processes and also are important in numerous environmental problems. This research program has dealt with the determination of thermodynamic properties for species involved in various mineral solubility reactions important at elevated temperatures and pressures. Partial molar heat capacities and volumes of various aqueous species are being measured and presently measurement techniques are being extended to allow determination of relative partial molar enthalpies and equilibrium constants. Previous results for the Al-O-H system have allowed calculation of various aluminum mineral solubilities to high temperatures and pressures using theoretical guidance of lower temperature results. Ongoing research is directed primarily at the need for fundamental thermodynamic data on species important to model mineral dissolution and elemental transport, and those involved in complex ion formation. Work to date has focussed on iron, uranium, and boron elements, complexes and hydroxides. Future work is underway or planned involving the investigation of precious metals and their complexes, rare earth elements and complexes, selected actinide species (including uranium) and complexes, transition metals and their hydroxides, and various metal ions with organic complexing agents.
