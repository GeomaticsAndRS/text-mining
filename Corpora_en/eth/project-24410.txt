Experimental investigation of transport mechanisms in milli-scale reaction systems with static mixing elements This study investigates the flow and mass transfer in tubular reactors with structured packings. In a first stage the thesis focuses on the investigation of simplified geometries with optical access. In a second stage the complexity is increased and in a third we investigate multiphase flows.
