Phase transitions in quantum systems Phase transitions in many body problems are one of the key areas in statistical mechanics. Universality at second order phase transitions is one of the most intriguing properties of such phase transitions: the properties close to the critical point depend only on the symmetry of the phases and the dimensionality of the problem but not on the details of the material. This universal behavior can be observed in experiments and lends itself to numerical simulations: results on a toy model can directly be applied to real systems. While analytical theories, such as renormalization group theory can predict the functional form and the existence of universal quantities, numerical simulations are essential in quantitatively determining this universal behavior. Progress in computational algorithms now allows us to perform simulations on quantum systems thousand times larger than was possible only a few years ago. This enables the simulation in the critical regime, where the correlation length diverges and large system sizes are needed. Up to now we have focused on quantum phase transitions in magnetic and bosonic systems. In particular, we studied : ground state and finite temperature phase diagrams of two-dimensional hard-core bosons quantum critical behavior in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
