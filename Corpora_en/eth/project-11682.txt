Antibiotic resistance genes in food: Molecular identifiation and transfer between microorganisms The antibiotic resistance (ABR) pattern of a representative bacterial group, the enterococci, in ready-to-eat food is analyzed, a methodology for direct determination of ABR genes in food was established and the impact on ABR gene transfer in food and environment will be experimentally approached.
