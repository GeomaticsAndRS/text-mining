Solar Energy Harvesting Nanograss Improvement of solar cells performance lies at the core of solar-electricity conversion. Rational design, nanomanufacturing and characterization of our functional nanowire arrays promise an engineering solution to solar energy harvesting. Collaboration: Prof. Wood (ETH) & Dr. Patscheider (EMPA).
