Biomaterials Based on Nanometric Calcium Phosphates Bone repair and regeneration offer a complicated and serious clinical problem in orthopedic surgery. We are applying a most recently developped technology for the manufacturing of extremely porous calcium phosphate biomaterials as nanoparticles for their possible applications as medical implants.
