Solubility and Complex Formation in Aqueous and Non-Aqueous Systems at HighTemperatures and Pressures The solubility of sparingly soluble compounds in aqueous solutions up to $500\dgand 1500 bar are being measured in large volume autoclaves containing flexible gold cells. The aim is to obtain information on the stability of certain complex ions under extreme conditions. For example, data on the stability of hydrosulphido-complexes of gold(I) and copper(I) are being obtained. These results provide information about the mechanisms of transport and deposition of transition metals by fluids in the crust. In addition, there are applications to the storage and isolation of toxic metal and radioactive waste as well as to hydrothermal corrosion in energy systems and hydrometallurgical processing. The solubilities of uncharged molecular species in supercritical carbon dioxide are also being measured with potential applications not only to geochemistry but also to chemical processing.
