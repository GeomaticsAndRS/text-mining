Transactions and E-Commerce Electronic Commerce over the Internet is one of the most rapidly growing areas in todays business. However, considering the most important phase of Electronic Commerce -the payment- it has to be noted that the different approaches currently exploited cannot be unified to obtain more complex payment protocols. These approaches are not compatible and do not allow several merchants and clients to be involved in complex Internet transactions. For such complex scenarios, atomicity and security requirements have to be achieved and a fast deployment of such application is crucial. To achieve this goal, we follow two main approaches. The first one is to use the benefits of transactional process management and to provide easy-to-use, predefined building blocks which could be easily combined into complex processes. Due to the provable correctness of transactional processes and the exploitation of process support systems developed at ETH, heterogeneous, and reliable complex payments can be generated interactively. The second one is to provide a general framework for secure transactions. For each transaction where money is involved, high security requirements are needed. Currently, these requirements are met by separately using cryptographic mechanisms and database technology. This is however not sufficient: a way to prove the execution was correct and that a given participant has not acted malicious is needed. Existing systems achieve this goal by highly specialized, non-portable solutions. By creating a transaction model which offers such guarantees, one could just specify a business transaction using the secure transaction semantics and profit from the automatically generated evidence and proof of correctness.
