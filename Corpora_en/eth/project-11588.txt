( See also http://www.ifd.mavt.ethz.ch ) The goal of the project is to validate LES using ADM for swirling flows in cylindrical geometries. The development of a high-fidelity numerical code for the simulation of compressible flows in cylindrical geometry has been completed. For code validation simulations of a tripole vortex formation have been performed. Comparisons with a high-resolution simulation of the same flow case using a Cartesian flow solver show excellent agreement. These results demonstrate that the new code incorporates a reliable centerline-singularity treatment that avoids a contamination of the flow solution by numerical artifacts. A viscous linear stability code based on the linearized compressible Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates was developed which incorporates different numerical discretization schemes (i.e. spectral collocation, implicit compact differencing and central finite-difference schemes). The computational framework has been cross-checked with a variety of results given in the literature and excellent agreement was found. Besides validating the recently developed flow solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with this linear stability code, we are interested in investigating the development (temporal as well as spatial) of disturbances of a laminar base flow as predicted by linear theory by comparison with the evolution of the analogous nonlinear system by means of direct numerical simulations and large-eddy simulations.
