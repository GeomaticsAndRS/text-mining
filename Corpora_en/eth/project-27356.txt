Investigating the mode of action of fatty acids against ruminal methanogens Ruminant livestock husbandry is the most important contributor of methane, an important greenhouse gas considered detrimental to global climate. Several promising, plant derived, inhibitors of ruminantSs enteric methanogenesis have been evaluated, where certain fatty acids are amongst the most effective. However, various puzzling finding make the prediction of level and occurrence of the methane suppressing effect difficult. Various factors of influence seem to be involved in the inhibitory effect these fatty acids exert on the ruminal methanogenic Archaea. There is evidence that fatty acids act directly upon methanogens and inhibit their growth. A major step forward in understanding the boundary conditions when fatty acids are efficient against methanogens would consist of the knowledge on how and where these fatty acids are influencing the methanogen cells. The aim of the present project is to determine possible mechanisms in this respect.
