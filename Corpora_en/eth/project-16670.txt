Changes in Radiation and Heat Budget of the Earth since the International Geophysical Year (IGY) Investigation of major problems in earth’s energy balance by reconstructing high-resolution energy budget for the earth’s surface and its variations. The major questions are 1) missing absorption; 2) cloud radiative forcing; 3) evidence of the enhanced greenhouse effect; 4) trend in evaporation.
