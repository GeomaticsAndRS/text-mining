Using spatial patterns of trees to build mechanistic models of species distributions in tropical forests The spatial patterns of tree populations leave a signature of the underlying processes that drive plant population dynamics. This project is developing new statistical tools for the spatial analysis of tree populations and using data from large forest plots to test a number of hypotheses.
