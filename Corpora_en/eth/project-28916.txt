Functional ecology of oceanic island floras We investigate functional diversity of oceanic island floras based on a broad range of plant functional traits to gain a better understanding of the ecological differences of island and continental plants ('island syndrome'), and support plant conservation and habitat restoration. In this project we investigate the functional diversity of oceanic island floras based on a broad range of plant functional traits to gain a better understanding of the ecological differences of island and continental plants ('island syndrome'), support plant conservation and habitat restoration, and improve predictions of alien species invasion risks on islands through comparative studies of native and alien functional trait spectra. Currently field work is under way in Seychelles and the Canary Islands.
