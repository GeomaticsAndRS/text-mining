SBaeyer-Villigerase ¸ clone libraries for biocatalysisT We are investigating various (cyclo)aliphatic compounds degraders as a source of Baeyer-Villiger Oxygenases. Heterologous expression and characterization of the different BVMO genes isolated using a degenerate PCR approach will result in a clone library as a valuable tool for biocatalysis.
