Implications of Age-Related Muscle Loss (Sarcopenia) for Spinal Posture, Loading and Fracture Risk The risk of osteoporotic fractures of the spine is compounded by postural decay with age and muscle weakening. Combining MR imaging of muscle volume and composition with multi-body dynamic simulation of skeletal loading, we aim to elucidate the relative contribution of each risk factor.
