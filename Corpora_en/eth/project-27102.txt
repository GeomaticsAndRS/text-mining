Bioavailability in humans of micronutrients from biofortified plants Recent developments in biofortification resulted in crops rich in iron and zinc. The aim of the proposed project is to assess zinc (and iron) bioavailability of micronutrient biofortified wheat using stable isotopes and to compare it to the bioavailability of conventionally fortified wheat flour.
