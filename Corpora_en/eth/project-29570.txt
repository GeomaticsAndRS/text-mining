MAQUIS: Modern Algorithms for Quantum Interacting Systems Understanding the properties of interacting quantum particles is one of the major challenges of condensed matter physics. On the fundamental side the very large number of coupled degrees of freedom, and the interplay between the quantum statistics and the interactions, leads to a host of novel physics. This ranges from superconductivity, new types of insulators (such as Mott insulators), quantum magnetism and several exotic other phases with remarkable properties. On the practical point of view most of today's material research involves materials in which strong correlations play a major role. The field of strong correlation is a field where the numerical techniques have proven an invaluable help and sometimes key methods to make progress in problems that would have been totally intractable otherwise. Over the past two decades a large number of new algorithms have been developed. Scaling these schemes to hundreds of thousands of nodes requires a concerted software development effort. There is potential for synergies with many other projects and the impact of the development efforts will go far beyond the scope of the MAQUIS proposal.
