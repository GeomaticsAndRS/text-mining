Historical stages of the landscape and their significance for landscape conservation and landscapedevelopment Although the landscape is changing quite fast, landscape conservation is of little social importance. The main reason for that is the lack of clear aims. So far, the main question in landscape conservation has not been answered: yet, why can which stage of the landscape be a model - as a reference stage of the landscape - for measures in landscape development. So, which stage of the landscape should be conserved or developed. In the planned project we establish the following three aims: Defining stages of reference and elaborating an argumentarium for the conservation and development of historical stages of the landscape . Comparing existing landscape development plans with this argumentarium. Proofing the relevance of historical stages of the landscape for local politics. The investigation area is the Linth-plain between the Lake Zurich and the Lake of Walenstadt. It is suitable thanks to its long and well-documented history of land-use.
