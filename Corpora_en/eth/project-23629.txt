Synthesis of block-copolymer surfactants Short, ampliplilic block-copolymers are attractive not only synthetically but also as surfactants, which could possibly be advantageous over conventional surfactants or as drug delivery media. Their synthesis is realized via living polymerization and their applicability is subsequently evaluated.
