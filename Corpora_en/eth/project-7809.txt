Correlations in Negative Muon Capture on Nuclei Various QCD-based models predicting scaling laws for nucleon and meson masses, the pion decay constant and the pion-nucleon coupling constant in nuclear media can be tested very precisely through a measurement of the induced pseudoscalar form factor F. Since the sensitivity to the induced couplings increases strongly with the momentum transfer in the reaction, muon capture by nuclei is an ideally suited tool for studying the semileptonic weak interactions. In our project we aim at a precise determination of F via a combined measurement of average polarization, longitudinal polarization and alignment of the residual $^{16}nucleus produced in the negative-muon capture reaction on Oxygen. The experimental method utilizes a stack target technique, sensitive to the recoil direction of the produced nuclei and the beta-decay asymmetry measurement as an analyzer of their spin orientation. Thorough tests have led to a design of the optimized experimental setup, which provides a perfect tool for nuclear polarimetry following muon capture. Within relatively short measuring periods a residual polarization of one percent can be measured with an absolute accuracy of about 0.3%. The first tests indicate the presence of a non-zero longitudinal polarization signal. However, additional efforts to produce and test a suitable stack target are necessary.
