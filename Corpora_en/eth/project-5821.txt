Applied genetics of propionibacteria Propionibacteria are used as dairy starter cultures in Emmental cheese production. They metabolize lactate to acetate, propionate and carbon dioxide. Their role in cheese ripening process is not fully understood and is still under biochemical investigation to increase the knowledge about enzymes like proteases, peptidases, esterases, lipases, autolytic enzymes and other enzymes which contribute to the development of the typical cheese flavors in the long ripening process. At the genetic level, neither the responsable genes nor the propionibacteria were generally studied in detail. An aim of this project is the development of genetic tools for Propionibacterium. We will search for single elements of such a genetic system like suitable strains, plasmids to be used as vectors, bacteriophages to find the conditions for transformation by electroporation of their DNA , cloning vectors and a method for transposon-mutagenesis in Propionibacterium driven by conjugatively mediated transposon-transfer from other organisms. Using the genetic tools we will study autolytic and bacteriocidic actions of selected Propionibactertium strains at the molecular level. .
