SEletrochemical Â¸ enzyme catalysis of stereoselective epoxidation A bacterial monooxygenase is isolated on preparative scale (multi gramm), lyophilized and can now be used as reagent for stereoselective epoxidation. The goal of the project is an understanding of factors influencing the catalytic efficiency of a chemoenzymatic reaction system.
