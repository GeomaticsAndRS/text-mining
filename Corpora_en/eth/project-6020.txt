Growth of Oxide Layers on Stainless Steels under Boiling Water ReactorConditions The aim of the project is the study of the ionic and electronic properties of oxide films on stainless steel as a function of oxidation time in high temperature (290 \dgC) water. The knowledge of the mechanism and kinetics of oxide layer formation is of a general technical interest in all cases where stainless steels encounter high temperature aqueous solutions - e.g. in nuclear technology. The corrosion of the nuclear grade stainless steel AISI 316L begins with the reaction of iron-hydroxide into a black, compact iron-chromium spinel and iron-nickel spinel. On the top of this spinel a loose, rustbrown maghemite layer is formed. The electrochemical corrosion processes can be observed only at low temperatures. Above 250 \dgC the corrosion rate is controlled by solid state diffusion. The electronic properties of the oxide films were characterized by photoelectrochemical methods and Mott-Schottky-analysis. The results clearly show that during longer exposure times not only the film thickness is increased but complex changes, e.g. Me(II)-ions -$\to$Me(III)-ions causing changes of the conductivity as well as the spinell layers growth increases with diffusion rate in the order Cr « Ni < Fe. Surface analytical methods (Secondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry) confirm these results and enable the correlation of the electronic properties with the chemistry of the film. Electrochemical impedance spectra show a highly complicated behaviour as a function of time. Thus a combination of various methods for the oxide layer characterization is necessary for a profound understanding of the film growth kinetics.
