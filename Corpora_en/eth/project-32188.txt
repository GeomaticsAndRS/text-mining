Reputation-seeking and Capacity-building? Compliance with EU rules in Western and CEE member states across different policy areas The project analyzes variation in compliance with EU law across the mem- ber states of the European Union. Research on member statesS implementation of EU legislation into national settings is abundant, but has mostly focused on the 15 Western member states with regards to their efficiency (speed) in adopting the EU requirements. However, there is little understanding whether national legislators and implementers in the enlarged Europe actually meet the European standards in a correct and appropriate manner. To fill these gaps in knowledge, the project addresses the following research questions: Descriptive questions: Do we observe systematic variation in compliance (a) between different EU member states, (b) between different forms of compliance with EU law such as efficient and correct legal and practical implementation? Explanatory questions: What factors account for variation in compliance across (a) EU member states and (b) different forms of compliance? For example, do the same mechanisms that explain variation in the 15 Western member states also influence the countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) or patterns in the latter group are explained by a different set of factors? How can we explain why some member states may notify timely measures that do not correctly meet the EU standards? To address such questions, the research project aims to analyse a comprehensive data set substantive compliance with EU rules in 25 member states (15 Western member states + 10 CEE countries) regarding directives from four policy areas: Internal Market and Services, Environment, Social Policy (employment and anti-discrimination) and Justice and Home Affairs.
