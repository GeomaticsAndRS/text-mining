Road Safety Management System This study intends to acquire the basic elements for a specially sampled network of all road types, on which data on traffic flow are collected periodically. The data on accidents (reported to police) are taken from the corresponding files. Both data types are then evaluated. The operation of such a management system (data bank) pursues three aims: - Identification of dependencies between accident occurrences, road design and traffic flow - Early identification of variations of traffic and accident occurrences, especially unfavourable trends with respect to road safety - Tailoring and testing of measures to improve road safety. This study should provide information about the sample size of data required, the type of analyses needed, as well as the organization of the databank operation, including its installation and operational cost. The prototype of this management system is operational, working on the basis of dRoad Software (Deighton Assoc., Oshawa, Canada). An extensive test series is currently undertaken.
