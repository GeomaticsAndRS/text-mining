Do plant communities converge over long time scales? The roles played by species identity and interspecific interactions in changing plant communities. The project addresses the question of convergence in given communities with the same set of species but with different relative species abundance at a particular time. We investigate whether the species' identity, interactions between species or environmental conditions are more important in changing plant communities. Near Lake Huettwilen (Canton Thurgau), the Seebachtal foundation aims to restore 55 hectares of formerly drained area to fen meadows. Topsoil has been removed on 3 hectares with subsequent sowing of appropriate seed mixtures. In these areas, we set up an experiment investigating long-term changes in designed plant communities. A total of thirty plots (plot size 10 x 10 m2) were established in spring 2005 at two sites and the communities were sown following the simplex design. All mixtures consisted of the same twenty fen meadow species; three species were sown in dominant proportions, and the remaining species in varying codominant and subdominant proportions. The communities will be monitored each year in late summer with vegetation-relevés; the data will be analysed using regression models. The results will allow differentiation between the influences of the species' identity and interspecific interactions causing changes in relative species abundance. The project provides a link between studies with planted, small-scale compositions and descriptive studies of changes in natural plant communities. It has relevance not only for basic ecological questions but also for fen meadow restoration and nature conservation.
