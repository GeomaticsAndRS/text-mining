High Speed Optical-Electrical Network Interface The goal of this project is the design of an optical-electrical network interface compliant with ATM on the electrical and SDH/SONET on the optical side. Different speeds from 155 Mb/s up to 10 Gb/s are to be realized. For the lower speeds up to 622 Mb/s, commercial components will be used. At higher bitrates, off-the shelf components are still very rare and expensive, thus new, more cost-effective solution must be developed. The challenges on the transmit side include the design of the fast serializer and the laser diode driver circuit. On the receiver side, a transimpedance amplifier for the optical detector and a robust clock and data recovery circuit are required. Furthermore, the network interface shall support fail-safe modes to enable bypassing of a node with local power failure.
