Decay, Weathering and Conservation of Monuments made of stony materials This work is object and practice oriented. Processes of decay are traced through continuous observation and analysis, accompanied by measurement (climatic parameters) and laboratory experiments. This enables the determination of specific, controlled and individually adapted conservation actions The highlight of this work is research into decay caused by salt and moisture, internationally renowned for its results. In addition, it is essential to watch over the decay and preservation process of the monument as a whole, from initial examination to maintenance. This work is co-financed by project-related loans granted by the client (cantons and other public owners).
