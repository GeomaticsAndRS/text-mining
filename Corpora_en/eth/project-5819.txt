Differentiation of Bacillus cereus from Bacillus thuringiensis Using Specific DNA Probes Bacillus cereus is a toxin producing and food poisoning bacterial species which seems to be closely related to the species Bacillus thuringiensis, an apathogenic biopesticide (insecticide). The selective media MYP and PEMBA which are used for Bacillus cereus are approved in the SchweizerLebensmittelbuch , although it turned out that these selective agars deliver indistinguishable colonies of both Bacillus species. The final goal of this project is the routine laboratory application of specific DNA probes which are specific either for Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis. Two approaches are chosen: first, we sequenced the 23S rRNA genes from each type strain and deduced an oligonucleotide probe which is now applicated to industrially used strains referred as Bacillus thuringiensis and second, a PCR-derived and randomly selected DNA probe has to be applicated. Additional information on the genome organisation from both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis will be needed for such differention studies
