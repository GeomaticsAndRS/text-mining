Phosphorus availability and its interaction with plant belowground carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus input to soil Low P availability is often the main limitation for plant growth and biomass production in tropical soils. We will investigate the role of P availability on the regulation of belowground C, N and P inputs by plants (grass, legume) and on the turnover of these inputs in soil.
