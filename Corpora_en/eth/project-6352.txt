Man Machine Interaction - Educational Software: ErgoLight: Simulation based learning of illumination ergonomics ErgoLight simulates the effects of different illumination conditions on people. It is currently being implemented in JAVA, the main application support the generation of applets, which can represent specific learning tasks. It teaches illumination ergonomics by letting students interactively explore different combinations of light sources and positions of the working place. Several parameters can be varied in the program, which makes it possible to study ergonomic lighting under different conditions. The program is designed to support the students in developing own hypotheses, and to test these in order to create a mental model of ergonomic lighting.
