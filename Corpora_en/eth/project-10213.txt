Nucleosome The nucleosome is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin. Its structure is paramount to our understanding of how DNA functions in the nucleus. Our aim is to determine many high-resolution X-ray structures of the nucleosome core, each containing a different genomic DNA sequence. The nucleosome is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, and both its internal and higherorder structures are crucial to the functioning of DNA in the nucleus. We solved the X-ray structure of the nucleosome core of chromatin originally at 2.8 Å resolution [1] and ultimately at 1.9 Å resolution [2-4]. This is the largest protein-DNA complex for which a three-dimensional, atomic image has been produced, containing 147 base pairs of DNA and two copies of each of the four core histone proteins. This highly reliable and detailed structure shows, for example, all the direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds between protein and DNA molecules. The structure also shows unusual, sequence-specific DNA conformations important for nucleosome positioning on DNA. Special features of the DNA observed support a twist-diffusion mechanism for nucleosome mobility. In order to achieve these results, we assembled particles from proteins and DNA produced recombinantly in bacteria [5, 6]. We developed analytical tools to assay the results [7, 8]. Currently, we are using robotics to extend the amount of high-resolution structural data available for DNA in the nucleosome.
