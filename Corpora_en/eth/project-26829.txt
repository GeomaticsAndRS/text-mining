Distributed Load Management Building on prior work at the ETHZ, we aim at using themostatically controlled loads to even out energy infeeds of renewbale energy sources and to provide ancillary services to the grid. We take into account both limitations imposed by available communication channels and existing infrastructure. It has been shown in previous projects that Load Management can be used to shift consumption peaks, to level load prediction errors or even to offer ancillary services. Adjusting the load to the production (as opposed to the current paradigm of adjusting production to the load) will be necessary when solar and wind are major sources of power generation. A grid, in which consumers and producers of electric power communicate with each other in order to guarantee a more reliable, highly flexible, automatized operation, can truly be called a smart grid. Research in Load Management has so far assumed perfect communication between the controller and the loads. Limitations imposed by bandwidth and latency of the communication channels may make adjustments of the control strategy and design necessary. A controller taking into account power line communication as used in current smart meter technology will be designed. A second focus of the project is in understanding the impact of Load Management on the distributi while it can have adverse effects, when used properly Load Management may be able on grid U to reduce strain on transformers and power lines as well as to guarantee the quality of the power supplied. Together with our partners EKZ and Landis&Gyr, we have applied for funding from the KTI. The decision is pending.
