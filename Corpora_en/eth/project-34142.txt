In situ/operando spectroscopic investigation of heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenations on chirally-modified metal catalysts The origin of enantiodifferentiation at chirally active solid-liquid inter- faces is investigated by means of in situ/operando vibrational spectroscopy combined with modulation excitation spectroscopy to provide fundamental insight into heterogeneous asymmetric hydrogenations.
