Soils and water regime of Swiss forests and forest sites under present and future climate (BOWA-CH) For the forest area of Switzerland, we will map soil properties that are relevant for the water regime of forest stands. Based on this data we will run a water balance model for 6000 plots of the National Forest Inventory (NFI)o detect regions that likely will suffer from drought in the future.
