Structural behaviour of glued-laminated timber reinforced with fibres The projectSs aim is to develop basic input data and advanced calculation models for the design of glued-laminated timber members reinforced with fibres. Because of the positive effect of the reinforcement, the influence of the large variation of the mechanical properties of wood can be reduced. The structural behaviour of glued-laminated timber beams is strongly influenced by the mechanical properties of wood and finger joints. Beams subjected to bending usually fail in the tensile zone starting from wood defects like knots or finger joints. The structural behaviour of glued-laminated timber beams can be improved by the use of fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) made of fibreglass, carbon or aramid. In this project in cooperation with the industrial partners Häring AG and Roth AG, the application of different fibres will be studied. The projectSs aim is to develop basic input data and advanced calculation models for the design of glued-laminated timber members reinforced with fibres. The results of a preliminary series of tensile tests on timber boards reinforced with basalt fibres showed that the reinforcement led to a strong homogenisation of the mechanical properties. The tensile strength of the timber boards was increased markedly in comparison to the theoretical value based on composite theory. Because of the positive effect of the reinforcement, the influence of the large variation of the mechanical properties of wood can be reduced and the 5% fractile values can be increased, making the design of glued-laminated timber members more safe, robust, efficient and economic.
