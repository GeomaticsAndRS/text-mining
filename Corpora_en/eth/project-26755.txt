Structural behaviour of glued-laminated timber reinforced with fibres The project≈†s aim is to develop basic input data and advanced calculation models for the design of glued-laminated timber members reinforced with fibres. Because of the positive effect of the reinforcement, the influence of the large variation of the mechanical properties of wood can be reduced.
