X-Ray Irradiation Sterilization of Pharmaceuticals With the increased awareness of the toxic problems associated with the ethylene oxide, greater attention is being paid to g-irradiation. Several pharmaceuticals in solid state, in solutions and in ointments were irradiated with doses of 25 and 50 kGy. Chemical, physical and biological investigations had been carried out, in order to study the feasibility of radiation sterilization and to elucidate the reaction mechanism for sensitive products. For the intention to protect pharmaceuticals from radiation damage, about 15 scavengers and their combinations have been tested. In some cases a successful protection of the active substance was possible. At this time we are able to sterilize an eye-ointment in its original package without significant loss of its chemical properties and biological potency. For the future it is planned to apply our strategy of radiation protection to various pharmaceutical formulations.
