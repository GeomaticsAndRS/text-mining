  The Action  aims to merge the efforts of the European research groups working on the Wind Energy Technology and the pathways to introduce it by means of robust applications to the urban and suburban built environment, thus enhancing the concept of Smart Future Cities. This Action  revisits safe, cost-effective and societally accepted wind energy technology for consideration in the design and development of the future urban/suburban habitat. The principal objective of WINERCOST is to collect the existing expertise on the Built environment Wind energy Technology (BWT) recently developed as a follow-up of the Onshore/Offshore Wind Energy Technology (ON/OFF-WET) and to investigate effective adoption methods for enabling the concept of Smart Future Cities. In addition, the utmost important issue of the social acceptance strategy will be scrutinized in close collaboration with municipality authorities, industry, manufacturers as well as the international wind energy organisations and platforms. A meticulously developed dissemination plan centrally based on the Action 's website, scientific publications in international journals, conferences and training schools, as well as the motivation of senior prominent experts, early stage researchers and opinion makers and involvement of industry and city authorities leaders to enhance the relevant social acceptance strategy.
