 Lead Lay summary One out of five women abuse drugs while pregnant (NIDA Notes 1995). Although this obviously affects the health of the mother, it may also indirectly compromise the well being of the offspring. In addition, drugs of abuse can have direct effects on the fetus. Both legal drugs such as nicotine and illicit ones such as cocaine can produce severe deficiencies in brain development.  
We hypothesize that both nicotine and cocaine exposure to the fetus delays the postnatal maturation of glutamatergic tranmission onto dopamine neurons (DA) of the ventral tegmental area in mice. These alterations may have an impact directly on properties of DA neurons and secondarily, on target regions of dopaminergic system, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), altogether leading to neurobehavioral changes in the offspring.  
The completion of this project will allow us to understand the rules governing maturation of synaptic transmission in both the VTA as well as the dopamine-ascending pathway that arises in the midbrain in the situation of excessive dopamine levels during development. We will identify changes in brain reward circuitry that may contribute to the vulnerability of adults who engage in drug seeking or drug consuming behavior after exposure to the same drug pre-natally. These changes could also have a potential impact on global child intellectual function and play an important role in learning dysfunction such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
