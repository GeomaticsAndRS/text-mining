 Lead Lay summary Dynamic orchestration of its molecular components is key in allowing a cell to exist and react to stimuli as a coherent system. This regulation can be achieved through various mechanisms acting at different cellular levels. Improper regulation can lead to cellular abnormalities and various diseases. We, and others, have recently identified a molecular pathway responsible for the modification of nucleotides in a specific subset of transfer-RNA (tRNA) molecules. tRNA molecules are key elements in the synthesis of proteins from messenger-RNA (mRNA) (i.e. protein translation). The proposed experiments aim at determining the functional consequences of tRNA modification on protein translation. Particularly, we are interested in determining if this mechanism can be used by the cell to achieve differential translation of specific protein sets. This would represent a major advancement in our understanding of growth control and regulation of cellular functions and could potentially provide a novel avenue for drug development. More generically, the proposed research will help elucidate the functional significance of nucleotide modifications. Surprisingly, as of today this still remains largely unknown, in spite of over 100 characterized modifications and many pathologies associated with improperly modified RNA molecules (e.g. MERRF, MELAS, familial dysautonomia, ?). We also propose to follow up on preliminary evidence suggesting that the same pathway we have identified as being responsible for the modification of tRNA nucleotides might be involved in the modification of additional RNA molecules. To achieve these goals we will use a combination of various approaches encompassing classical biochemistry, genetics, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Indeed, part of our research will focus on the establishment and further development of mass spectrometry-based workflows for modification-aware RNA sequencing.
