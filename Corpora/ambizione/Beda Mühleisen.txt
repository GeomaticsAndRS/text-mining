 Lead Lay summary Our overall goal is to define the role of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) in skin innate immune defense. PTHrP is a peptide with homology to parathyroid hormone but produced in the skin and with largely unknown function. Our key preliminary findings are that PTHrP can strongly induce expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin in keratinocytes and that PTHrP/PTH-signaling can enhance protection against bacterial skin infection. Cathelicidins are small peptides with antimicrobial properties and important immunomodulatory functions. Recent scientific evidence has shown that cathelicidins are critically involved in several diseases: Relative absence of cathelicidin enhances the risk for certain types of skin infection, impaired wound healing and atopic dermatitis, whereas too much cathelicidin and abnormally processed forms thereof trigger inflammation in psoriasis and rosacea. Upstream factors that may control the expression of PTHrP or its receptor PTH1R in the skin are still unknown. Understanding these factors and the exact mechanisms involved would improve our understanding of the role of the PTHrP/PTH1R signaling pathway in controlling cathelicidin in skin biology and disease. This project aims at elucidating the molecular events that control PTHrP and PTH1R in the skin and at defining its role in wound healing.
