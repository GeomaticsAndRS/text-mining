 Lead Lay summary Many Arctic and Antarctic species (fish, insects, plants) survive extreme cold by producing antifreeze proteins (AFPs) that depress the freezing point of their bodily fluids in a non-colligative manner without altering its melting point. Several mechanisms have been proposed for this thermal hysteresis, including the compelling adsorption-inhibition mechanism wherein AFPs are thought to adsorb onto the ice crystal surface at preferred growth sites thereby halting the ice crystal growth process. In pharmaceutical and food applications, this natural cryoprotective ability could be useful in the preservation of organs and food products upon freeze storage for example. Moreover, proteins with a strong binding towards interfaces may be efficient emulsifiers and useful for biomineralisation and bioremediation purposes. The project will tackle some of the remaining fundamental questions related to in vivo AFP efficacy and investigate the potential of AFPs as stabilizers of air-water and oil-water interfaces by means of an integrated physico-chemical approach. Key aspects concern (1.) a potential link between AFP solubility, surface activity, and thermal hysteresis activity, (2.) whether AFP changes its conformation upon adsorption, (3.) whether AFP adsorption is reversible or irreversible, (4.) what factors can be considered as driving forces for adsorption, (5.) whether AFPs can be used as potent emulsifiers, and (6.) whether AFPs form ordered structures at interfaces. The results will contribute to a deeper understanding of AFP functioning on a very fundamental level. In addition, we hope that this knowledge will ultimately be translated into innovative solutions in medicine and (bio)technology where interface adsorption and regulation of ice crystal growth are important determinants of product performance and quality.
