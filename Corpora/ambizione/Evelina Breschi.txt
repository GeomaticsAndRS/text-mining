 Lead Lay summary This project will investigate a branch of atomic magnetometry which has been poorly investigated to date. The proposed atomic magnetometer measures the magnetic field by a phase-sensitive comparison of the atomic Larmor precession frequency with the frequency of a specific electromagnetic radiation interacting with the atoms. For precise and sensitive applications the external frequency should be referenced to a frequency standard such as an atomic clock. We propose to study a variant of the coherent population trapping (CPT) effect, the so-called push-pull optical pumping, recently proposed by the Happer group of Princenton University. The enhancement of the resonance contrast in the case of push-pull excitation of hyperfine coherences (clock application) has already been proven, but its use in magnetometry has not yet been explored. We want to demonstrate that with this approach we can efficiently access both magnetic field sensitive and magnetic field insensitive resonances in order to develop a device consisting of a sensitive atomic magnetometer containing its own intrinsic time-reference. 
The project is organized in three phases: the realization of the experimental apparatus, the investigation of the relevant features of the light-atom interaction and finally the characterization of the self-referenced magnetometer.
