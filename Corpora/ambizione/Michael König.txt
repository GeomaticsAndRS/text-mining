 Lead Lay summary Many studies have been devoted to the investigation of the consequences of a certain R D network structure on a firm's performance. However, only little is known about the evolution of this structure, or the antecedents of this evolution. The goal of this project is to understand the evolution and performance of R D networks. In particular, I focus both on the relationship between the structure of an R D network and its performance, on an individual and aggregate level, and on the dynamics of network creation and evolution. I use the network structure to model the way in which an industry of firms generates and diffuses knowledge. I try to explain the formation of R D networks as a purely endogenous phenomenon, emerging from the behavior of individual firms. I study how this behavior affects the types of networks that emerge at the aggregate level, and how a firm's position in the network affects its knowledge productivity and performance. My analysis intends to reveal that R D networks are highly dynamic structures that can only be understood by taking into account the two-way influence from the individual behavior of firms to the emergence of the network and the dynamic feedback from the network to the behavior of the individual firms. 
In doing so, this study is genuinely interdisciplinary in its attempt to combine methods from economics, sociology, mathematics, computer science and physics. The successful combination of these disciplines shall point at practical implications for policy makers to strengthen the competitiveness of an R D intensive economy in which firms exchange knowledge through R D collaborations.
