 Lead Lay summary One of the central goals in Neuroscience is to understand the mechanisms mediating the enormous information storage capacity of the brain. Associative learning is the process by which we form connections between environmental stimuli, thoughts and feelings. A large body of research has characterized plastic changes in the strength of connections between single nerve cells, termed synaptic plasticity, which are thought to underlie learning. However, neuronal networks are composed of many different types of nerve cells with specific functions, which interact during information processing. Therefore, our focus is to understand how the various circuit elements are modified by learning, and how the sum of these changes translates to altered network function. We have established a set of advanced physiological techniques utilizing 2-photon imaging combined with viral and transgenic tools to simultaneously measure activity in many, identified neurons in auditory cortex of the intact mouse. These approaches are applied to study classical (Pavlovian) fear conditioning, a simple form of associative learning. In addition to recording activity patterns, we are also able to manipulate the activity of identified neuronal populations in behaving animals during learning using optogenetic approaches. This allows us to directly test the effect of activity in specific neuronal populations on memory formation. Our results will define the roles of specific neuronal sub-populations in neocortex in the acquisition and expression phase of associative learning. In addition, fear learning in mice shares major hallmarks with human anxiety disorders, and we expect to gain insights into the cortical mechanisms determining whether learning leads to the formation a specific (appropriate) memory, as opposed to a generalized (pathological) memory.
