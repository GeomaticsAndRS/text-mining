  Gas-Selective Polymer Membranes 

 Membrane technology for filtration and separation of gases or liquids has achieved an immense importance during the last 25 years. Waste water treatment, purification of natural gas, sea water desalination, and recovery of volatile organic compounds in the chemical industry are typical examples where organic and inorganic membranes are used today. The mechanism of separation is generally based on size-sieving or solubility differences in the polymer matrix. In this project we are going to study the so-called concept of facilitated transport of volatile organic compounds (e.g., formaldehyde, toluene, acetone, dichloromethane, or ethanol) through new tailor-made polymer membranes. Facilitated transport is based on molecular recognition between host and guest molecules. Selective host molecules (developed for use in chemical sensors) for alcohols, aldehydes, amines, water, sulfur or carbon dioxide are to some extent already reported in the recent literature and will be incorporated into the membrane bulk. Moreover, the following factors are significant for our new polymer matrix: - Polymer backbone and host molecule are chemically crosslinked - The use of plasticizer is rejected - Polymerization generates no residues (e.g., metal catalysts) - Heat resistance of at least 50-70\dgC is required
