  Project PRIMALP - Sustainable Primary Production in the Alpine Region: Core Project  

 The so-called 'Core Project' is an integral part of the project 'PRIMALP - Sustainable Primary Production in the Alpine Region'. The objective of the Core Project is the development of a sectoral model for the assessment of different strategies of the Alpine primary production with respect to their sustainability. For this evaluation specific indicators will be used. In the model the three aggregation levels farm, region and Swiss Alpine area are included. This is necessary on the one hand to integrate the results of the disciplinary projects of PRIMALP, on the other hand to meet the requirements of sustainability. The effects of different political, economic and institutional scenarios on the sustainability can be studied by means of a change of the indicators integrated in the model. Political decisions and their implications can also be presented this way. Different strategies of land use in mountain regions will emerge that meet the requirements of sustainability; an unequivocal solution is not likely to be found. Another task of the Core Project is the internal and external communication. Internal communication is defined as an exchange between the participants of the project 'PRIMALP'. Consistent concepts for a future sustainable primary production shall be communicated externally.
