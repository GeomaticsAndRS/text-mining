  The Effects of Crustal Melts on the Chemical and Isotopic Composition of the Harzburgite-ComplexNear Finero, N-Italy  

 The mafic-ultramafic massif of Finero, N-Italy contains highly depleted peridotites which have experienced a pervasive metasomatic overprint including formation of phlogopite, amphibole, \pm apatite, \pm carbonates. The 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, 206Pb/204Pb ratios, and incompatible trace element pattern of the phlogopite peridotites clearly indicate that the melts causing formation of phlogopite and amphibole derived from subducted sediments. On the other hand peridotites and pyroxenites of the Finero massif are characterized by oxygen isotope ratios typical for mantle rocks. One of the goals of this project is to develop a model that can explain this apparent contradiction. In addition, the behavior of e.g. platinum group elements will be investigated using the new UV-laser-ICPMS and UV-laser-MC-ICPMS techniques at the IGMR. A basic assumption of this project is that metasomatism of the Finero peridotites has been caused by crustal melts that percolated and reacted with harzburgitic rocks in a subduction zone environment. Similar hydrous melts might cause fluid-induced melting in cpx-rich, lherzolitic mantle at temperatures between 1200 and 1300 $^{\uo}. The Finero peridotites gives us a unique opportunity to look directly at processes in the mantle above a subduction zone without having distortions by partial melting, crystal fractionation and crustal contamination as seen in volcanic rocks. The results of this study will improve the understanding of processes in the mantle causing volcanism above subduction zones and complement investigations on the same topic using volcanic rocks.
