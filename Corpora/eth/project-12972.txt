  Stepped Spillways  
Stepped spillways allow to continuously dissipate a considerable amount of the kinetic energy. Also, the cavitation risk along the spillway decreases due to smaller flow velocities. Nowadays stepped spillways tend to be designed for increasing dam heights and design discharges.
