  Well-conditioned Boundary Integral Equations for Scattering  
We develop novel second-kind single-trace boundary integral equations for acoustic and electromagnetic scattering at composite objects. They are inherently well-conditioned  and allow discretization by means of discontinuous boundary elements.
