  Numerical Simulation of Particle-laden Flows  
In order to study fundamental mechanisms of particle suspensions, an initially spherical suspension drop settling in a fluid under gravity is investigated by direct numerical simulations. A second configuration concerns an initially random suspension of particles in homogeneous turbulence. 
A special class of disperse two-phase flows is considered, in which the particles are much smaller than the smallest relevant scales of the fluid motion. This allows for the particles to be modeled as point-forces without resolving their finite size. In the simulations an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is used: the Navier-Stokes equations are solved in an Eulerian framework by a Fourier pseudospectral method, whereas the particles are individually tracked along their trajectories (Lagrangian tracking). The mutual exchange of momentum between particles and carrier fluid is taken into account (two-way coupling). In order to study fundamental mechanisms of particle suspensions, a suspension drop (initially spherical cloud of particles) settling in a fluid under gravity has been investigated. The focus is on moderate drop Reynolds numbers between one and a hundred, at which the drop gradually disintegrates while settling. The process involves the formation of a torus eventually breaking up into a number of secondary blobs. Different physical and numerical aspects of the settling process were studied in detail, such as the number of secondary blobs depending on the Reynolds number, the influence of the initial conditions, the instability mechanism leading to break-up, the influence of the periodic boundaries and the influence of the interpolation method used to interpolate both the fluid velocities onto the particle positions and the particles' feedback force onto the computational mesh.
