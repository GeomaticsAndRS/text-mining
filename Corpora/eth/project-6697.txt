  The R Project for Statistical Computing  

R is 'GNU S' - A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is similar to the award-winning S system, which was developed at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers et al. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques (linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, ...). R is designed as a true computer language with control-flow constructions for iteration and alternation, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Here at the http://stat.ethz.ch/ Seminar für Statistik\rh, we are using R as primary tool for research, data analysis, and teaching. We have (one of the first) mirrors of the http://cran.CH.r-project.org/ The Comprehensive R Archive Network\rh, and manage the http://www.r-project.org/mail.html R related mailing lists\rh.
