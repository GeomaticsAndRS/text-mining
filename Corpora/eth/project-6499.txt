  Evolution of the forest uses and their impact on the forest structure with regard to sustainabilityin central Bhutan  

 The aim of the study is to analyse the impact of the traditional forest uses on the forest structure. It analyses the structure of the different forest types present in the study area and defines the use and management of different forest products which are used and managed traditionally by the rural population. Both forestry and sociological surveys were conducted, as one of the underlying hypotheses of the research is that the use and management of natural resources in general, and forest resources in particular, has to be approached by conducting investigations both of the actual resource use and the socio-cultural perception of the local resource users towards their environment. On the average, the forest uses proved to be extensive and no impact on the structure of forest used traditionally by the villagers could be traced. The only forest product which has a significant impact on the forest structure is the extraction of blue pines to be used as beams, for which nearly all blue pines with a dbh around 30 cm are felled. The structure of the forests, in which the extraction of trees for beams takes place, is thus strongly affected. The traditional use and management of the forest products have been strongly influenced by the social and natural conditions of the rural population. Whether the present system can be carried on or should be replaced by a more economical management of forest resources in the long run is what the final discussions is all about, as there is neither a single nor a simple answer to this question.
