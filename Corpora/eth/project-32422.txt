  Horsenettle inbreeding  
This is an ongoing long-term project aimed at elucidating the effects of infraspecific genetic diversity and inbreeding on plant-insect-microbe interactions in the invasive weed horsenettle, Solanum carolinense. 
This is an ongoing long-term project aimed at elucidating the effects of infraspecific genetic diversity and inbreeding on plant-insect-microbe interactions in horsenettle, Solanum carolinense. This invasive weed possesses an rnase-mediated gametic self incompatibility system. However, there is both phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability in the degree of self compatibility, and considerable inbreeding occurs in incipient populations under natural conditions. We have documented significant inbreeding depression under field conditions and shown that inbreeding compromises diverse aspects of the plant defense phenotype, so that inbred plants are far more susceptible than outbred plants to damage from insect herbivores and pathogen infection. In recent work, we are attempting to document the molecular mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects of inbreeding and to exploit the disruptive effects of inbreeding to gain insight into the normal functioning of the well-adapted phenotype seen in outbred individuals.
