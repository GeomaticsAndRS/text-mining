  Mimulus  
This project is exploring the effects of inbreeding on plant-pollinator interactions in Mimulus spa. We are characterizing differences in floral odors between inbred and  outbred lines of these plants as well as the impacts of inbreeding on pollen quality and abundance.
This project is exploring the effects of inbreeding on plant-pollinator interactions in Mimulus spa. We are characterizing differences in floral odors between inbred and outbred lines of these plants as well as the impacts of inbreeding on pollen quality and abundance. Our objectives are to to determine the extent to which floral volatile phenotype plays a role in bumblebee attraction to Mimulus guttatus and to elucidate the roles of (i) mating system, (ii) pollinator syndrome, and (iii) phylogeny in Mimulus floral volatile production.
