  Acoustic Noise Emission of Magnetics - Silent Power for Smart Grids  

In future energy transmission systems more and more inherently fluctuating renewable energy sources as well as storage systems will be integrated. This requires a more dynamic control of the power flow, which could be achieved with compact and highly efficient solid-state transformers operating at a few kHz. The solid state transformers also could replace bulky and heavy transformers operating at grid frequency in case of space and/or weight limitations as e.g. in offshore wind turbines. However, such medium-frequency transformers usually have significant acoustic noise emissions mainly due to the vibration caused by the electromagnetic forces in the cores and windings. In order to predict the noise emission by such transformers without building prototypes, acoustic models with reasonable accuracy are essential. So far, the investigations on acoustic modeling are mainly carried out for electrical machines operating at a few 10Hz. In this project, the modeling approach for predicting acoustic emissions for magnetic components operating at medium frequency will be investigated. The most promising modeling approach will be identified based on the review of existing approaches for electrical machines and numerical simulations. An acoustic model of the transformer will be developed and the performance of the model will be evaluated with a test transformers. Based on the acoustic models, also transformer design improvements as well as modulation optimizations for reducing the noise generation are investigated.
