  Investigation of Secondary Metabolism and Biological Activity of Cyanobacteria  

 Cyanobacteria, also termed blue-green algae, occupy a unique phylogenetical position between bacteria and higher plants. Although being procariotic organisms they possess the ability of oxygenic photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria species are distributed worldwide in ecollogically diverse habitats and are capable of surviving under different inhospitable conditions. Earlier work has shown cyanobacteria to be a rich source of novel natural products and promise a diverse array of potential pharmaceutical lead compounds. Our research project concentrates on the isolation and structure elucidation of new biologically active secondary metabolites from collected and cultured cyanobacteria of terrestrial and freshwater origin. In a first step chosen species are extacted and characterized by several biological test systems revealing antimicrobial, cytotoxic and molluscicidal activity. Various chromatographic methods are used to fractionate promising extracts. Pure compounds are isolated with bioassays serving as a guide to isolation procedures. Their chemical structure is characterized by several spectroscopic methods, mainly high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but also mass (MS), ultraviolett (UV), infrared (IR) spectroscopy and others. Isolated compounds are evaluated for their detailed biological and pharmacological properties by several biotests performed in-house as well as in cooperation with other academic institutes and the pharmaceutical industry.
