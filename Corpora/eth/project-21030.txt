  Fire behaviour of glued-laminated timber beams  
The aim of the research project is the development of a calculation model  for the fire resistance of glued-laminated timber beams taking into account the behaviour of the bonding adhesive at high temperature.
The structural behaviour of glued-laminated timber beams is strongly influenced by the behaviour of finger joints. The behaviour of the adhesive used for bonding can influence the fire resistance of glued-laminated timber beams. The aim of the research project is the development of a calculation model for the fire resistance of glued-laminated timber beams taking into account the behaviour of the bonding adhesive at high temperature.
