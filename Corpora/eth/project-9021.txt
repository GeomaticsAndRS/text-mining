  Analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in Swiss pig breeding herds  
We identify causative mutations for several interesting phenotypes in domestic animals. For instance, the fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) M307 mutation is used for markerassisted selection of E. coli F18 adhesion-resistant pigs.
We identify causative mutations for several interesting phenotypes in domestic animals. For instance, the fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1) M307 mutation is used for marker-assisted selection of E. coli F18 adhesion-resistant pigs. Thereby, a prerequisite for E. coli F18 bacterial adhesion causing oedema and post-weaning diarrhea is eliminated. Furthermore, we identify the 1843 C to T mutation in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene in order to prevent a rise of the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in our swine populations. We have achieved an extraordinary resolution, down to a single nucleotide difference, in the genetic analysis of a QTL. Determination of complete genome sequences of the porcine species in the near future will allow the exploitation of the full potential of pig genomics. High-density singlenucleotide polymorphism typing of pigs will allow identification of selective sweeps as documented here. Farm animals are emerging as prime model organisms for understanding the genetic basis for multifactorial traits.
