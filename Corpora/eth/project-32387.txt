  Plant virus ecology  

This project explores how viral pathogens alter interactions between host plants and insect disease vectors (as well as other, non-vector, organisms). Specifically, we have been examining virus effects on plant nutritional quality, anti-herbiovre defenses, and the visual and olfactory cues presented to foraging herbivores. Our work has revealed intriguing patterns of virus effects on host-plant phenotypes and plant-vector interactions that correspond to patterns of virus transmission. We have also explored the underlying biochemical and physiological mechanisms that generate these phenotypes. And we have examined the implications of co-infection by virus strains with shared (aphid) vectors differing effects on host phenotypes. In recent work we are examining the ecological implications of virus-induced changes in host plant phenotypes on broader community-level ecological interactions.
