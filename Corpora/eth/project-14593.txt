  ERA-NET European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) 

Fifteen research organisations, that in the past participated in the international Ocean Drilling Programme (ODP) through individual national programmes and by national subscriptions to the ESF, have created a European research structure, the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD). This structure will serve as the basis for all aspects of scientific ocean drilling research in Europe as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program SIODP-Earth, ¸ Oceans and LifeT commencing in October 2003. The funding agencies propose to use the ERA-Net structure for the implementation of ECORD and move towards a single research and operational funding structure for science in Europe enabled by ocean drilling. The ERA-net will network the management and co-ordination aspects of ECORD with all areas of scientific drilling in the oceans and continents, to marine geophysical surveys which require validation by drilling, and to marine observatories. The participating funding agencies are: 1 Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (INSU- CNRS) France 2 Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) Germany 3 National Environment Research Council (NERC) UK 4 Swedish Research Council (VR) Sweden 5 Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) Netherlands 6 Office for International Relations in Science and Higher Education (GRICES) Portugal 7 The Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNÍS) Iceland 8 Research Council of Norway (NFR) Norway 9 Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Switzerland
