  From the Dawn of the Universe to Today: The Co-evolution of Galaxies and Black Holes  
This project aims to understand and quantify the role that the energy liberated by the growth of supermassive black hole has on the formation and evolution of galaxies. The project will make use of multiwavelength astronomical data from a variety of observatories on the ground and in space.
