  Dynamics of Railroad Cars  

Tests performed with the new Eurocity railroad car of SBB before putting itinto service showed  two severe problems. The additional roll dampers forthe bogies tend to excite structural vibrations of the car body. Thesevibrations significantily reduce riding comfort. The second problem isconcerned with higher frequencies. Under certain conditions structure bornesound generates an unpleasant noise within the railroad car.Expensive modification of the support of the roll dampers has beennecessary to solve these problems. To avoid expensive surprises in future,a KWF project with the following two aims has been started in cooperationwith SBB and all major railroad vehicule manufaturers (SIG, SWG, SLM) inSwitzerland:* Accurate dynamic simulation of railroad car behaviour including flexiblecar body to predict and to optimize riding comfort. Because only lowfrequencies influence riding comfort, only the first few eigenfrequenciesneed to be taken into account for simulation. These modes can be calculatedby FE-Analysis and combined with a rigid model of bogies and axles.* To understand mechanisms of excitation of sound radiation parts and tominimize structure borne sound. A complete FE-analysis of a railroad carbody within this frequency range (< 25 Hz) seems to be inaccurate. Modalanalysis of subparts in conjunction with experimental tests will benecessary to get accuarate results.
