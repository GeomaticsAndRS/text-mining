  Picro-ilmenites: An experimental study in simple and complex systems to investigate P-T-fO2-composition relations at high pressures 
This is a joint project between the Institute of Mineralogy and Petrology of ETH and De Beers Exploration, Southdale, South Africa that targets the experimental determination of physio-chemical properties of the rhombic Fe-Ti-Mg oxide phase picro-ilmenite at  high-pressures and high-temperature.
