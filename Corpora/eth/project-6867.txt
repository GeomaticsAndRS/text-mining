  Scanning Near Field Optical Microscopy and Spectroscopy for Nanoscale Chemical Analysis 

Researching the nanometer scale is currently of great relevance in many branches of modern science and engineering. As nanoscience and nanotechnology develop, powerful nanodiagnostic tools capable of recording chemical/molecular information with exquisite spatial resolution will become increasingly important. We are developing scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) for nanoscale molecular analysis. SNOM the "optical member" of the family of scanning probe microscopies and based on a subwavelength light source that is scanned above the object of interest at a distance of a few nm. In the optical near field, the illuminated area is not limited by diffraction, but merely by the size of the illumination source (50 - 100 nm). SNOM imaging can be done nondestructively and under ambient conditions. Two main lines of research are pursued: (i) using aperture SNOM with tips designed for high optical transmission and for sustaining pulsed laser radiation, for laser ablation mass spectrometry with subwavelength resolution, and (ii) apertureless SNOM, employing an external CW laser field and Raman spectroscopy (TERS). a metallic tip to greatly enhance the local field for Stip-enhanced ¸ T We have also developed a second-generation SNOM-MS instrument that combines laser ablation at ambient conditions, transport into a vacuum chamber, an efficient post-ionization / ion storage stage, and mass analysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Questions that are being addressed with these methodologies include the determination of the composition of thin solid films, the characterization of novel materials and elements of molecular electronics, the investigation of biological objects in their natural environment, the chemical analysis of polymer blends, and the study of chemical reactions on the surface of heterogenous catalysts
