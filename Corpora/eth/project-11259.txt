  Molecular optics with Rydberg states  

The ability to fully control the translational motion of atoms and molecules in the gas phase is a tantalizing prospect for chemistry. Atoms and molecules could be directed into a well-defined reaction zone or slowed down and cooled to ultracold temperature. To effectively control the motion of gas phase particles it is necessary to exploit their electric or magnetic properties, i.e. their electric dipole or quadrupole moments or their magnetic dipole moments. In this project we aim at controlling the motion of atoms and molecules excited to high electronic states, so-called Rydberg states by using inhomogeneous electric fields. The basic idea is to take advantage of the fact that atoms and molecules in high Rydberg states have dipole moments several orders of magnitude larger than atoms and molecules in their ground states. In this way very large acceleration (or deceleration) forces can be exerted on the particles, up to 107 times as large as the gravitational forces. Keywords: Rydberg states, electrostatic deceleration, atom and molecule optics. References: S. Procter, Y. Yamakita, F. Merkt and T. P. Softley, Chem. Phys. Lett. 374, 667 (2003); E. Vliegen, H. J.
