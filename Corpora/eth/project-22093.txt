  GEOTHERM  
GEOTHERM is a CCES-funded project that constitutes a comprehensive program of basic research on key aspects of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGSs), including but not limited to the observations arising from the attempts to develop a system at Basel during 20062007.
GEOTHERM is a consortium of research groups from ETH Zürich, EPF Lausanne, the Paul Scherrer Institute and the University of Bonn, who are conducting basic research on key aspects of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGSs), including but not limited to the observations arising from the attempts to develop a system at Basel during 2006-2007. The proposed work will contribute to understanding and developing an alternative and sustainable energy resource free of CO2-emission. Novel observation techniques and new process-simulation tools will be developed. The overall aim of the project is to better understand the processes active during reservoir creation and long-term circulation, and to improve the predictability of EGS development in Switzerland and worldwide. The project consists of five research modules: T ¸ Insights into permeability creation from wellbore observations T ¸ Insights into permeability enhancement processes and estimation of seismic hazard from analysis of seismic waveforms T ¸ Modelling the permeability creation process in EGS reservoirs. T ¸ Modelling fluidUrock interaction & scale formation during geothermal heat extraction T ¸ Sustainable development of geothermal energy in the urban environment
