  Magnetic Structures and Phase Transitions in Rare Earth (RE) Intermetallics and inBoracites  

The interest in RE intermetallic magnetic structures arises from their non-uniform physical properties extending from simple ferromagnetic to complex incommensurate structures, from the spin glass to the superconductor. Thus, magnetic materials are of interest with regard to possible technical applications (microelectronics, permanent magnets) and also with regard to theoretical aspects (magnetism, phase transitions, higher-dimensional crystallography). The experimental work is done by neutron and X-ray diffraction as well as by the measurement of the electric, optical and magnetic properties. Examples may be found in the systematic study of the binary and ternary compounds REXx-d (X=Si,Ge,Sn, x=2,3) and REMxX2 (M=Mn, Ni,Fe,Co). Novel incommensurately modulated magnetic structures were found. Boracites undergo a ferromagnetic/ferroelastic at high temperatures (200-700) K and order magnetically at low temperatures with various types of symmetry reduction. The consecutive magnetic phase transitions originate from frustration effects of the antiferromagnetic triangular arrangement of Co/Ni.
