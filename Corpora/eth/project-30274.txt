  Population-based analysis of tractography data 
The functional repertoire of a cortical area is closely related to its anatomi-  cal connections. A segregated cortical area may therefore be characterized by a coherent connectivity pattern. The aim of this project is to study the consistency and heterogeneity of connectivity patterns across subjects.
Subdividing the brainSs cerebral cortex into structurally and functionally distinct areas arises from the notion that cortical structure reflects function. Given that brain regions frequently maintain characteristic connectivity profiles and that the functional repertoire of a cortical area is closely related to its anatomical connections, connectivity is used to segregate cortical areas. This methodology is called connectivity-based parcellation. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop a novel unsupervised information theoretic approach to connectivity-based parcellation that considers similarity and especially variability of connectivity patterns within a population. In particular, we aim to expand the concepts recently introduced under the framework of approximation set coding (Buhmann, 2010) to validate models that describe nested connectivity patterns within the human brain in a large population of subjects. Such connectivity data will be obtained in the form of probabilistic tractograms gained from diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI), which are made available at the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Research in Cologne, Germany.
