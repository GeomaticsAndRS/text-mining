  Unraveling the role of novel molecular signaling pathways in the regulation of pain  

Chronic pain triggered by tissue damage, inflammatory diseases or damage of nerve cells, severely attenuates the ability of patients to recover from the primary disease and significantly interferes with their quality of life. Currently available treatments very often provide only insufficient pain relief. The discovery of exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids and their receptors has opened an entire new area of pain research and has raised great hope for better treatment options of chronic pain. However, psychoactive side effects of classical cannabinoid agonists rendered their widespread use difficult. Recent discoveries indicate that cannabinoid signaling in the brain is far more complex than intitially thought and this raises hopes that there are molecular signaling pathways, which may become future drug targets. The goal of the consortium is to reveal how newly discovered signaling components participate peripheral and central pain processing. The Hungarian scientists were among the first to describe the molecular architectur of endocannabinoid signaling, whereas the Swiss counterpart discovered how distinct cell types and synapses control pain sensation With joint forces and expertises, the Consortium will delineate several new molecular pathways in which endocannabinoids regulate spinal pain processing. The molecular, anatomical, pharmcological and behavioral aspects of the signaling pathways involving the endocannabinoids, 2-arachidonolyglycerol and anandamide, will be discovered. The Consortium will first identify their synthetic enzymes, their receptors and the proteins responsible for their elimination at a cell- and synapse-type specific level. Then the researchers will show their involvement in pain regulation offering new targets for the development of more potent and selective analgesics.
