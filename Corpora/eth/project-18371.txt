  Analysis in fluid inclusions by laser ablation ICP-MS  
Determination of sulfur in fluid inclusions is of importance for the study of ore forming processes. This project will develop alternative techniques for this callenging analytical problem, and apply them to better undestand the origin of magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au-Mo deposits
Many ore deposits are formed by hydrothermal fluid circulation in large magmatic systems. To investigate the geological processes leading to this metal enrichment, analytical techniques for fluid-inclusion microanalysis are of fundamental importance. This work presents and discusses improvements in fluid inclusion analysis with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The opening of a single quartz hosted inclusion with a laser is delicate due to stress in the mineral and the low absorbance of the laser light even at 193 nm. Therefore, the possibility of cracking resulting in a so called catastrophic ablation is high. An established strategy is to start with a small crater and stepwise increase the crater diameter as shown before by Günther et al.. Our new strategy includes an iris diaphragm with a minimal opening in the range of 0.1 mm (resulting in a minimal crater size of 4 mm) and a continuous opening to the desired crater size. To characterize hydrothermal fluids, trace elements like Au, Cu, Mo, Fe and main components like Na, K need to be quantified within individual inclusions. The quality of inclusions varies widely, and to analyze very small inclusions in the range of 10 micrometers dedicated optimization procedures on the ICP-MS are inevitable. Several methods can improve the limits of detection and extend the available size range to smaller inclusions, like polyatomic gas addition to the Helium carrier and the influence of signal dispersion, as well as the use of a new SF-ICP-MS.
