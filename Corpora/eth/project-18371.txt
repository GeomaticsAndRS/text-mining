  Analysis in fluid inclusions by laser ablation ICP-MS  
Determination of sulfur in fluid inclusions is of importance for the study of ore forming processes. This project will develop alternative techniques for this callenging analytical problem, and apply them to better undestand the origin of magmatic-hydrothermal Cu-Au-Mo deposits
