  Virus Specific T and B Lymphocyte Reactivity and Tolerance  

By applying the transgene and homologous gene recombination technology in mice, we are  studying the antiviral cell mediated and humoral immune response against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). T cell receptor (TcR) from T helper (TH) and cytotoxic T cells (Tc) transgenic mice allow us to investigate the ontogeny, thymic selection and activation processes leading to elimination of virus, tolerance and memory towards virus antigens. The crossing of these TcR-transgenic animals with animals expressing the recognised viral antigens transgenically encoded in specific tissues or generally in the periphery enables us to follow the fate of antigen specific TH and Tc cells during ontogeny and maturation or during virus infection leading under special circumstances to an autoimmune disease. One of our transgenic mouse model was designed to serve as an animal model for diabetes mellitus type I. It can be used to develop peptide treatment protocols leading to antigen specific tolerance and therefore prevention of the virus induced disease. The elucidation of the mechanisms of T lymphocyte mediated cytolysis is carried out with mice with a nonfunctional perforin gene. This is studied in the context of viral and bacterial infections, transplantation, tumor cell transfer or autoimmunity. In addition we are evaluating the role of T helper cells in controlling affinity maturation and the antibody isotype switch in vivo in normal mice and in mice expressing a single virus-specific variable region of a neutralizing antibody generated gene technologically by homologous recombination.
