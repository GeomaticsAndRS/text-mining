  Elucidating the mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA deletions  
In this project, we analyze the distribution of direct repeats and stem loops in the mtDNA of human, rhesus monkey, mouse and rat, to establish the significance of finding such motifs nearby deletion breakpoints. We will also study the stability of DNA hybridization around pairs of breakpoints .. 
Deletion mutations within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been implicated in degenerative and aging related conditions, such as sarcopenia and neuro-degeneration. While the precise molecular mechanism of deletion formation in mtDNA is still not completely understood, genome motifs such as direct repeat (DR) and stem-loop (SL) have been observed in the neighborhood of deletion breakpoints and thus have been hypothesized to take part in mutagenesis. However, as such genome motifs are abundantly found in native mtDNA sequences, the statistical significance and hence the validity of hypotheses of mtDNA deletion mutagenesis have not been carefully addressed. In this project, we analyze the distribution of direct repeats and stem loops in the mtDNA of human, rhesus monkey, mouse and rat, to establish the significance of finding such motifs nearby deletion breakpoints. We will also study the stability of DNA hybridization around pairs of breakpoints to check if mtDNA misalignment can be a cause of deletions.
