  Man Machine Interaction - Graphical User Interface (GUI): Guidelines for Software Developers  

 As the growth of computers has spread into all aspects of life, from industry to entertainment, the need for interfaces that are understandable and usable by all parts of society has also grown. From the initial command languages have grown complex interfaces that allow free selection with direct manipulation (using the mouse). These interfaces present new and complex problems to the user, especially where the computer is controlling industrial equipment. Multiple windowing systems, with complex navigational structures are becoming standard for general use. It is the goal of the institute to perform research into the interaction between the graphical user-interface and the computer system. Ease of learning and ease of use (for inexperienced and experienced user) are the primary strategies to aid the safe decision making and task selection needed to provide a consistent and logical environment for the computer user. The research investigates the graphical interface and the method of its response to the user, with the meta-goal of producing a set of guidelines for future system design.
