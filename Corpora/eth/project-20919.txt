IPFM(individualized parametric facade-modules with decentralized building services) has the goal to investigate the production of parametric façade-modules with integrated building services in a new building model. Parametrics in planning and production enable demanding energetic requirements as well as adapt to differentiated customer requests. Despite prefabrication, the building industry at present is increasingly overtaxed with the rising technical complexity posed on the buildings. State of the art building practice can be improved through parametric façade-modules with integrated, decentralized, modern building service systems.
