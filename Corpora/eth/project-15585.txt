  Auto-ID Lab  
The Auto-ID Lab devotes its research to the business impacts (processes, products and services), applications and and, together with GS1 / EPCglobal, the infrastructure of the "Internet of Things". The main topics of the ETH lab are Internet of Things and mobile applications for global commerce.
The research program we pursue is as diverse as the challenges our research partners face. We divide our about 100 research projects into the three building blocks Hardware, Software & Network, and Business Processes & Applications. At the hardware level we look at sensor, RF & chip design issues and focus on (a) the development of class 2 and higher tags that might include memory, battery, sensors, and actuators, and (b) on enhancing the read rates in challenging environments. The related research projects are mainly driven by the labs at MIT, Fudan, ICU, and Adelaide. At the business layer we investigate business cases, applications, privacy and security aspects with a clear focus on fundamentally new consumer interactions which include payment, services, recommender systems, quantified self, consumer big data, and new loyalty program concepts. While all labs are involved in business related questions, the labs of St. Gallen/ETH, Keio, Cambridge and MIT are leading these efforts. With respect to the software & networking categories we research the future network and system architecture which needs to support fundamental new business processes and leverage the functionality of class 2 and higher tags. Again, all labs are involved in software & network research. However, MIT, and Keio dedicate most of their resources to this.
