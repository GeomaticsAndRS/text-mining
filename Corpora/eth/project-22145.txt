  Quantitative investigation of cancer cell metabolism by novel 13C flux analysis methods and metabolomics  
The project aims at developing methods of 13C flux analysis to qualify and quantify the activity of central carbon metabolism in higher cells. In particular, we investigate  the metabolic responses occurring in (some) cancer cells to perturbation in the pathways of oxygen and glucose signaling.
