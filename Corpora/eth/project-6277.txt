  Mechanisms of heavy metal binding in cement-stabilized wastes  

The aim of this work is to understand the mechanisms that control heavy metal mobility in  deposits of cement-stabilized wastes in order to predict their long term behaviour. It is currently thought that the cement matrix plays an important role in the immobilization of the heavy metals by binding metals and by controlling the pore water chemistry. The mineral formation in cement stabilized flue gas scrubber residues from municipal solid waste incinerators is being examined using a combination of laboratory leaching experiments and spectroscopic techniques. The results will be combined in a thermodynamical model to simulate the leaching process. In a second step metal binding mechanisms will be examined in detail in a model metal-cement mineral system.
