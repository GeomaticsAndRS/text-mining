  A novel mammalian cell-based approach for the discovery of anticancer drugs with reduced cytotoxicity on non-dividing cells  
A key asset of cytotoxic drugs in cancer therapeutics is their ability to discriminate between proliferating and mitotically inert cells and eliminate preferentially neoplastic ones. We have designed a high throughput-compatible mammalian cell-based assay for the discovery of cytotoxic drugs.
