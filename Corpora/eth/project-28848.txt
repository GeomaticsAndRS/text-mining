  Exploring the Peak of Cosmic Star Formation  
An observational program to study the physics of galaxies at and around ~ epoch of peak in the cosmic star formation history the redshift z2
We are using extensive data sets such as the zC-SINF and COSMOS surveys, and new data with the VLT, Keck and Hubble Space telescopes, to study the underlying stellar distribution in massive galaxies in the epoch 1 < z < 4.
