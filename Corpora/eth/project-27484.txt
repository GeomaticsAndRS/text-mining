  Single cell reprogramming analysis using droplet-based microfluidics  

It has recently been shown that controlled encapsulation of cells into droplets can be achieved using microfluidic architectures. This provides the opportunity to quantitatively study the communication of cells with their surrounding environment. The isolation of cells into picolitre droplets enables detection of chemicals that are secreted or taken up by cells. This is because they achieve detectable concentrations in the liquid surrounding the cell when confined in the picolitre volumes. It has also been shown that single cell encapsulation efficiencies (in droplets) can be dramatically increased by aligning cells in focused streams prior to their encapsulation. This provides further leverage in performing studies on single cells and on interaction of two different cells by confining single cell of each type into droplets. One such study is nuclear programming of differentiated cells into pluripotent cells using cell fusion. The fusion of a differentiated cell with an embryonic stem cell induces reprogramming in nucleus of the differentiated cell towards a pluripotent state. Current off-chip methods exhibit low fusion-efficiencies. The goal of the project is to engineer microdevices, which can first encapsulate single cells into droplets, then selectively merge them so that the merged droplets contain one cell of each type and mediate cell fusion. The microfluidic systems will then be used to monitor the reprogramming process. Studies will be performed with researchers at the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre in London.
