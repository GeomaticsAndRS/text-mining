  Chemically Selective Nanoprobes 

 Local ion activity variations over membrane surfaces and ion channels are of considerable interest in pharmacology and molecular biology. Existing ion-selective microelectrodes show limitations which are supposed to be overcome with the design of novel devices. Ion-selective AFM tips (AFM: Atom Force Microscope) could be useful probes in order to compete with potentiometric microelectrodes in local and intracellular measurements. Coating the AFM tip with a layer permselective for a specific ion should result in a selective charge separation at the boundary and, therefore, generate a boundary potential which is monitored in potentiometry. Charge separation at the boundary of a tip coated with an ion-selective layer will be traced in this project by force-distance curves using AFM-technique. The AFM technique lends itself to nondestructive surface analysis in solution. Ion-selective AFM cantilevers could reveal local ion activity variations, especially in the environment of ion channels, allow theoretical studies, and allow to map the density of a specific ion on a surface. These studies contribute to the understanding of the limitations of potentiometric microelectrodes. In a first step, the coating technique involving various tip qualities was developed. In a second step, force distance curves on mica (X$_{2}$_{4-6} $_{8}$_{20}$(OH,F) $_{4}$, where X: K, Na or Ca but also Ba, Rb, Cs; Y: Al, Mg, Fe, but also Mn, Cr, Ti, Li; Z: Si$_{x}$_{y}$, but also Fe and Ti) were compared to those taken on a K$^{+}$-active and, alternatively, on a blank substrate in aqueous solutions. Mica is the most frequently used reference substrate with a platy morphology.
