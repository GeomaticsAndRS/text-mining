  Polarization Effects in Mott Scattering of Electrons  

Scattering of electrons in the electrostatic field of heavy nuclei is referred  to as Mott scattering. It is surprising that polarization tests of Mott theory are rather scarce and of limited precision. In fact for energies above 1 MeV, they are nonexistent. Our interest in Mott scattering is stimulated by the usefulness of this process in precision studies of the polarization of leptons emitted in weak decays. Analyzing powers for Mott scattering are fairly large at backward angles for electrons with energies in the range between a few keV to tens of MeV. Not only absolute values of Mott analyzing powers, but also depolarization effects in thick scattering targets are very important for most applications. Such depolarization effects are notoriously difficult to estimate. In an experiment at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) we studied polarization phenomena in the elastic scattering of 14 MeV electrons from lead nuclei. Polarized electrons were delivered from a modern, strained cathode electron source. The asymmetries were measured as a function of the target thickness, and then extrapolated to infinitely thin foils. These results are in good agreement with calculations taking into account the finite size of the lead nuclei. The results of this experiment may be also useful for diagnostics of the beam polarization at high energy electron accelerators.
