  Fuzzy Control  

Since the first published paper on fuzzy-logic in 1972, interest in fuzzy-logic  control has been growing rapidly. Due to the verbal description of the controller with linguistic variables, fuzzy control seems well suited for nonlinear systems normally controlled by human experts. Difficulties arise when the system is too fast to be controlled manually. Currently, no fuzzy logic control theory exists that is based on a mathematical description of a system. This research project is focused on the design of fuzzy logic controls using nonlinear control theory. A fast fuzzy controller for an active magnetic bearing was developed with an implementation based on nonlinear control theory. Although the theory is complicated, the controller design can be done with little effort. The magnetic bearing is stable and shows a significantly improved step response compared to a linear controller. In addition, the nonlinear fuzzy logic structure was analysed and compared with several linear and nonlinear controllers. For the fuzzy logic controller design, it can be shown that it is not necessary to use complex fuzzy operators. Instead the fuzzy routines can be reduced to only a few simple operators.
