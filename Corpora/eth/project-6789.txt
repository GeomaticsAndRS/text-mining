  Organogels and Cubic Phases  

We have developed in the group two new families of gels (the socalled  lecithin gels and the gelatin organogels), in which the medium is an organic apolar solvent. Particularly challenging is the case of lecithin gels, as here an extremely high viscosity can be achieved without polymer components. The work is now proceeding along the following lines, under the supervision of PD Dr. Peter Schurtenberger: i) physical characterization of different lecithin and gelatin gels; ii) study of the lecithin gels as matrices for the transdermal transport of drugs.
