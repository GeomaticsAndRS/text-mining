  Catalytic pyrolysis of biobased feedstocks over taylored zeolites  
This project focuses on the generation of a biocrude featuring reduced oxygen content and enhanced thermal stability, thus enabling to minimize the use of H2 within pyrolysis or in the subsequent hydrodeoxygenation. Co-generation of chemicals will be also applied  where possible.
Zeolites are the most suitable materials for bio-oil upgrading. Zeolite upgrading enjoys significant processing and economic advantages over hydrodeoxygenation: operating cost is reduced as hydrogen is not required and biomass processing happens at atmospheric conditions. However, the presence of micropores imposes intra-crystalline diffusion limitations, leading to low utilization of the catalytically active volume of the zeolite. Therefore, increasing access of reactant molecule to the active site is very important. This further achieves significance when some reactant molecules are large in size as in the case of fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. One of the solutions to this problem comprises the introduction of mesoporosity. Introduction of mesopores can make the larger molecules accessible to active sites and get converted into smaller ones which can undergo transformations inside microporous network leading to the formation of aromatic molecules. The main challenges to zeolite upgrading of bio-oil are increasing aromatics production and reducing coke yield.
