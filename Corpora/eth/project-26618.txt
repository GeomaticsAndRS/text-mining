  Digital Stereotomy  
This research is developing a method for tessellating free-form masonrylike vaults, which is influenced by the general shape of the surface (design intent), its visual appearance (tectonics), the structural analysis (force flow) and fabrication as well as material constraints.
This research is developing a method for tessellating free-form masonry-like vaults. The tessellation of the geometry is influenced by the general shape of the surface, linked to the design intent, its visual appearance (tectonics), the structural analysis (force flow) and fabrication as well as material properties. Based on the tessellation pattern, individual blocks are generated automatically in a digital continuous process.
