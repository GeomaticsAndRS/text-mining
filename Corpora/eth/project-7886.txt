  Clock Extraction and Data Regeneration/Retiming Circuits  

In all digital communication systems the transmitted data has to be synchronized with the  local clock at the receiver side. There are several possibilities to achieve that, along them the utilization of SAW filters, Phase Locked Loop (PLL) circuits or of Delay Locked Loop (DLL) circuits. The main advantage of the two last solutions is that they can be integrated within a chip, thus reducing the size and cost and increasing the reliability of the system. Such a synchronization circuits are usually called clock extraction circuits. A complete clock extraction and data regeneration/retiming circuit based on the PLL architecture has been developed on a 1\gmm bipolar SGS-Thomson technology. The circuit is able to extract from the incoming data stream the transmission frequency and to regenerate and retime the data. Integrated in the chip are a completed PLL (with phase detector, active loop filter and voltage controlled oscillator), an edge detector and a decision circuit. The output signals available are the clock and data signals. In order to operate, the circuit requires an external resistor and capacitor for the active loop filter and an additional resistor to select the central frequency of the PLL. Only one power supply source is needed and the power consumption is 200 mW at -4.5 V. Special care has been taken in order to reduce the lock-in time (which is less than 200 bits) and at the same time to keep the output jitter low (typical 2.4 ps). Bit Error Rate (BER) measurements of a random input PRBS 2$^{31}$-1 with mark/space rati s of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 and a differential input signal of 25 mV$_{pp}$have reported no errors over a measuring period of one hour, leading to BER better than 1.11° u10$^{-13}$.
