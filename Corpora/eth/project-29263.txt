  Identification of candidate genes responsible for zinc and iron loading into wheat grains  
Plants are known to maintain metal ion homeostasis through sophisticated molecular mechanisms that tightly control the acquisition and distribution of metal ions to the specific compartments and for storage. We study the molecular mechanisms underlying micro-nutrient composition in the wheat grains.
