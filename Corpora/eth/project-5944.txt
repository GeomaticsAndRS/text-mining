  Gene Therapy of Epilepsy  

Gene therapy is being used in order to establish a new approach to the  treatment of therapy-resistent focal epilepsies. Cells which are genetically engineered to produce inhibitory neurotransmitters will be transplanted with the aim of controlling the epileptogenic neuronal activity in the epileptogenic focal zone of the brain. This project is being conducted in close collaboration with the univestity clinics of Neurology and Neurosurgery.
