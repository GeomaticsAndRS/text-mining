  Triggering of Rapid Mass Movements in Steep Terrain  
The project looks at the mechanisms of triggering landslides, avalanches and debris flow. The innovative angle is the capitalization on the similarities in phenomena which belong in separate communities. The motivation comes from the fact that sudden mass movements are a major hazard in Switzerland.
