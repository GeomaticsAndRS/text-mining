  De-aeration of large conduits  
The experimental study focuses air pocket movement in horizontal to downward sloping large conduits and the air removal by structural and hydraulic means. Further, the behaviour of the two-phase flow in air chambers and in vertical to inclined de-aeration shafts are investigated. 
Closed conduits and tunnels with pressurized flow are components of hydropower plants. Air in the pressure system may have negative effects on their operation and energy production and cause serious damage. Depending on the details of the hydraulic system and the flow pattern of the air-water mixture flow the discharge capacity is reduced. Further, pressure fluctuations and high pressure pulses due to abruptly expanding pressurized large air pockets may occur. To avoid air entrainment into pipelines, air entrainment must be suppressed, therefore, despite this cannot completely be achieved in practice, either due to design limitations or due to cost. This problem appears to increase in the future because of the extension of existing power plants to a more flexible operation, in terms of peak power production. It is fundamental to evacuate conveyed air from tunnels in hydraulic engineering by suitable deaeration or venting systems. These consist usually of a de-aeration chamber and a pipe or drill hole on top of it, which evacuates the air. The de-aeration chamber corresponds hydraulically to a junction of two different interacting hydraulic systems. Its components are air-water flow in the large horizontal and slightly inclined conduit, and the air-water flow in the vertical and inclined de-aeration pipe. The purpose of the present study is a generalized description and design guidelines of these systems.
