  Synthesis, Structural Investigations and Biological Evaluation of Oligomers of Beta-Amino Acids  

 Major shortcomings of natural alpha-peptides such as insufficient stability of secondary structures or degradation by proteolytic enzymes can be overcome by short oligomers of beta- amino acids. These beta-peptides form stable secondary structures such as helices, pleated sheets, turns and hairpins in solution; their cyclic derivatives fold into nanotubes in the solid state. Beta-peptides are resistant to the degradation by proteolytic enzymes, and there has been a first example of their use in mimicking natural peptidic hormones. Reasearch is directed towards the understanding of the principles that govern the formation of stable secondary structures and their utilization. The group is involved in synthesizing beta- amino acids and to develop new methodology for their preparation. These beta-amino acids are coupled to give beta-peptides that are studied in terms of their biological activity or of their structural features by a large variety of spectroscopic techniques such as CD, FT-IR, X-Ray and multidimensional NMR. Gamma-peptides are also studied by the group.
