  The defense cascade activated in GM-Gala apples against the Fire Blight causing bacterium - Feuerbrand  

The popular apple cultivar Gala is susceptible to Fire Blight. This highly erratic disease is controlled by application of antibiotics or drastic pruning and eradication. We created a GM-Gala apple resistant to Fire Blight by introducing a resistance gene (FB_MR5) from the wild Malus robusta 5 accession. In this one-year project we will attempt to identify the genes of the defense cascade activated in the GM-Gala upon recognition of the causal bacterium. We will compare a non GM-Gala with a FB_MR5-Gala by whole transcriptomic analysis, followed by a detailed analysis of candidate genes expression in a time course study. We will expand this study to the original M. robusta 5 using additionally a pathogen race overcoming the resistance. We expect to identify genes which expression is enhanced or suppressed upon activation of the mechanisms of defense by the introduced FB_MR5 recognition system and eventually genes modulated by the pathogen during colonization of the susceptible host. The results will clarify if the functionality of a introduced resistance gene by genetic engineering is equal to the same gene introgression by classical breeding.
