  Structure of QCD eigenstates  
The spatial structure of QCD eigenstates, especially in the zero-baryon (vacuum) and one-baryon sectors, has been a long-standing topic of theoretical and experimental interest. We study this structure using numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice. 
The goal of this project is to identify the spatial structure of hadrons and of the QCD vacuum. Hadrons are not hard spheres: they are made of moving, point-like quarks, whose positions are not independent of each other. Thus, a structure emerges, which can be measured in high-energy scattering experiments, or studied here from first principles by numerical simulations of QCD on the lattice. Similarly, the QCD vacuum is not empty: fluctuations of the gluon field give it a structure, whose topological properties have been the focus of much theoretical attention because of their likely relevance to the confinemet of quarks. This structure also can be investigated by lattice QCD simulations.
