  Energy-Using Durables: Driving Forces of Purchase Decisions  
The project views the purchase of energy-using durables essentially as an investment decision that is driven by economic variables such as prices, costs and discount rates, as well as by psychological factors, such as inattention to future costs. 
One of the key determinants of purchase decisions regarding energy-using products are consumers'discount rates. Whether or not it pays to buy a comparatively expensive high-eciency product with lower energy costs depends crucially on the magnitude of the discount rate applied to future energy costs. The project addresses the following research questions: 1. Do consumers of energy-using durables in fact misoptimize, i.e. behave as if their discount rates were excessively high? 2. What are the driving forces of excessive discount rates? 3. Which one of the potential forces (imperfect information, inattention, or credit constraints) is the most important cause of misoptimization? 4. Are there observable consumers' characteristics that correlate with the degree of misoptimization? 5. What are adequate corrective policy programs that account for consumers' heterogeneity? We will conduct two types of interrelated studies: 1. Survey at the point of sale, and 2. Concomitant online experiment, which will generate data on consumers' purchase motives as well as on their behaviorally revealed discount rates.
