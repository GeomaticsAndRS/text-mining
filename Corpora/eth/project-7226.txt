  Algorithms for Filter Bank Based Multicarrier Transmission  

Multicarrier transmission is an advantageous technique for broadband wireless communication  over multipath channels as the application of complex equalizers at the receiver can be circumvented. In orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), cyclic signal extensions in guard periods preserve the orthogonality of the subcarrier signals. While being favorable in terms of receiver complexity, this concept has several disadvantages like e.g. a waste of parts of the signal energy and scarce bandwidth resources. Filter bank based signaling techniques represent a more general way of MC transmission. To minimize interference and simultaneously achieve a fast decay of the sidelobes, pulse shapes with superior time-frequency (TF) localization characteristics are a promising approach. This way, the amount of hampering interference can be reduced compared to a single carrier transmission with an equivalent data rate, while a degradation of the bandwidth efficiency due to guard periods is avoided. Iterative detection schemes have been investigated and it has turned out that they benefit from the properties of TF concentrated pulses for a significant reduction of the computational complexity.
