  Computational engineering of multi-scale transport in small-scale surface-based energy conversion  
The first goal of LTNT within this project is the study of the fuel processing in micro reactors, particularly the production of syngas from hydrocarbons. The second goal of the project is the numerical simulation of the chemically reactive flow and the electrochemistry  in the anode side of a SOFC.
