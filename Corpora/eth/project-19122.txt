  Generic fire risk assessment in residential and industrial buildings  
The aim of the research project is the development of a method for fire risk assessment in residential and industrial buildings.
The aim of fire safety engineering is to reduce the consequences, i.e. human and financial losses, as much as reasonably possible. Fire safety can be increased by passive and active fire safety measures. These measures can be regarded as decision alternatives in the context of fire safety management. Because fires cannot be avoided completely, certain consequences always have to be anticipated. The expected value of the consequences corresponds to the fire risk and can be influenced by fire safety measures. Every measure is associated with costs and, if related to the corresponding risk reductions, a certain benefit. If the acceptability of fire safety design in terms of risk to life is fulfilled, then it is reasonable to compare the costs of fire safety measures with its benefits, i.e. to perform an economic optimization of the overall costs. This is leading to a choice of efficient fire safety measures regarding risk to life as well as financial losses. To compare and select efficient measures a generic and quantitative fire risk assessment method is required. Generic risk assessment facilitates quantification of the expected values of consequences due to fire events in dependence of risk indicators and fire safety measures. Both may be associates with uncertainties due to lack of knowledge and randomness. A probabilistic model allows to consider these uncertainties consistently and to represent the physical processes of a fire hazard.
