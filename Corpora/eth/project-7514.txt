  Stability of Hydrous Mantle Minerals  

The high pressure and ultra high pressure stability of hydrous mantle minerals has  profound influence on processes in the upper mantle: subduction of water to depths, arc type i.e. calc-alcaline volcanism, mantle metasomatism. Studies on hydrous magnesium silicates, titanium magnesium silicates (humite minerals) and aluminous magnesian hydrosilicates are performed in piston-cylinder and multi-anvil, ultra-high pressure, apparatus to pressures of more than 12 GPa. The minerals antigorite, magnesian chlorite and Ti-Clinohumite have been shown to be stable to more than 0.7 GPa and more than 700\dgC, containing up to 13 percent H$_{2}by weight. In contrast to the dehydration of hydrous oceanic crust these minerals carry an order of magniture more H$_{2}to depths.
