  Flow- and deformation-behaviour of plastified powder mixtures with fat- or water-containingfusible components  

The treatment of concentrated suspensions, pastes respectively, is found in many food processing industries. These pastes are produced by mechanical (e.g. filtration) or thermal treatment (e.g. drying) of low viscous suspensions, which efforts normally a great amount of energy involved. Also the mixing of these now high viscous suspensions needs a considerable amount of energy to get a homogenious product. In order to reduce the problems mentioned above the approach in this work is to mix the basic materials as a powder. After this the plastifying powder component will be melted respectively half melted, so that a paste will result. For plastification a double screw extruder is used, which builds up a high shear and pressure gradient. For the characterization of the pastes the coherence between rheology and matrix structure of the high viscous suspensions has to be well known. Also the influence of entrapped gas, resulting from the porous bulk material, has to be taken in consideration of the matrix structure, the growing of the structure (sinterplastification machanism) respectively. The first experiments will be done with 3-component-powders as modelsystems, which content one plastifyable component, e.g. fat- or water-powder (ice-powder). In a second step the modelsystems will be replaced by real food products like chocolate and ice cream.
