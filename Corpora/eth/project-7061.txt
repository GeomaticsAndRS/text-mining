  The Effects of Urban Change on Violent Crime  

Swiss cities have experienced a considerable increase of violent crime since the mid 1960s.  Also, rates of violent crime in the cities have increased at a faster pace than national crime rates. The project is aimed at identifying the social processes that have contributed to growing violent crime in the cities. The theoretical approach combines general criminological paradigms such as control theory, strain theory and the routine activity approach with theories of urban change. The empirical work is based on official crime statistics and a survey of 1000 violent crimes reported to the police in the city of Basel. It is argued that inner city areas increasingly bear the burdens of processes of social disintegration with marginalized social groups becoming more highly concentrated in some urban areas. Special consideration is given to the effects of drug problems and the involvement of immigrant groups in violent crime. Analyses of spatial mobility patterns also show that a considerable proportion of both offenders and victims involved in violent crimes between strangers are not urban residents but live in the suburbs.
