  Adenovirus-mediated transduction of auto- and dual-regulated transgene expression in mammalian cells  
Transduction of therapeutic transgenes using multiply attenuated viral vectors is considered an essential technology for gene therapy scenarios. While first-generation viral transduction systems were engineered for constitutive expression of a single therapeutic transgene...
