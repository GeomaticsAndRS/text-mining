  Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization: Theory and Applications  
This project addresses the exploration­exploitation dilemma, fundamental to many applications in engineering, science and society. It has the goal of bridging the gap between theory and practice by developing new algorithms based on Bayesian optimization and evaluating them on real applications.
Which ads should we display in sponsored search in order to maximize our revenue? How should we dynamically rank information sources to maximize value of information? Which sensors in a sensor network should we activate when in order to best monitor some unknown phenomenon over time? These and other problems can be formalized as bandit optimization with complex, structured decision spaces. We are developing novel algorithms and analyze them in the no-regret model. We evaluate our approaches on several real-world information gathering problems.
