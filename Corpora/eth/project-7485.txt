  Theoretical Analyses of Solvation: Ion-solvent and Ion-ion Interactions  

Research is underway related to the development of theories for solvation phenomena  based on fundamental experimental data obtained from ionic equilibria investigations in the gas phase. Currently effort is focussed on simple continuum models and the limited range of their applicability as well as computer simulations of water and water containing simple solutes. Work is in progress using detailed models for polarizable water that allow consistency between the results of calculations and known fundamental quantum mechanical and spectroscopic information. Work has been completed involving multi-layered continuum models that have provided exact agreement with experimental observations of the enthalpies and Gibbs energies of solvation.
