  Adaptive polynomial chaos expansions for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis in structural dynamics  
Uncertainty quantification aims at evaluating the impact of uncertainty in input parameters onto the response of a computer model. The project develops polynomial chaos  expansion methods for addressing UQ problems in civil engineering with the goal of structural reliability and risk analysis.
