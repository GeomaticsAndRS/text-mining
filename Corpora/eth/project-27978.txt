  Campi Flegrei Deep Drilling Project (CFDDP): Rheology and pysical properties of feldspar- and bubble-bearing andesite and trachyte magmas 
Project focuses on (1) Experimental determination of rheologic and elastic properties of intermediate magmas with feldspar crystals and vapor bubbles, and (2) petrophysical measurement on recovered samples from CFDDP to characterize elastic properties and to test and  apply experimental results.
