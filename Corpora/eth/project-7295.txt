  Lowest Power GHz Transmitter Receiver (LOPTX)  

The goal of this project is the design of a very low power, highly integrated  transceiver chip for cordless phone applications in the 1.9 GHz band and a miniaturized antenna. Today, a variety of commercial chipsets for DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone) exist, but none of them meets the size and power consumption requirements for a wrist-carried telephone. In the initial phase of the circuit design, basic building blocks such as low noise amplifiers, mixers, voltage controlled oscillators and power amplifiers have been designed, fabricated and tested as individual chips. As the specifications of the single function blocks are met, these blocks can be combined to more complex systems. A first prototype of the complete transceiver is currently being tested.
