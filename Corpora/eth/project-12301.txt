  Biomaterial-based drug and antigen delivery systems  
Composite biomaterials are studied for drug and antigen microencapsulation to improve biodegradation characteristics with less pH-changes, stricter control of release kinetics, and the possibility to functionalize the surface of the particulates for targeting to specific cells.
