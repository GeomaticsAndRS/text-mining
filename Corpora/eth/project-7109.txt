  Dynamics of Alpine Flow Phenomena  

 The Alpine domain hosts a range of distinctive meso-scale orographic flow phenomena and these exert a considerable influence upon the weather, climate and air-quality of the region. Diagnostic and modelling studies of some of these phenomena are undertaken to explore their origin and structure. Particular attention is given to the role of the Alps, the influence of the earth's rotation, and the impact of upper-level flow features in the form of potential vorticity anomalies that advect into the region.
