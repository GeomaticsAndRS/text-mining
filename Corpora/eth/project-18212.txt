  Application of sub-nanoliter dispensing technologies for the production of microarrays  
Application of non-contact sub-nanoliter dispensing technology for the production of high-throughput molecular screening microarrays. 
Low-volume non-contact dispensing technologies are applied to the production process of microarrays. In the area of life sciences, microarrays have become an indispensable tool for highthroughput screenings of molecular interactions and cellular signaling events. Optimizing and adapting non-contact sub-nanoliter dispensing devices is essential for the development of new applications including quantitative microarraying and reverse microarrays. In combination with customized surface chemistry development, the established printing technologies allow for highly reproducible and quantitative read-out of microarrays, overcoming two of the current main limitations of microarray technology.
