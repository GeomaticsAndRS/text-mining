  Improvement of Strength and Fracture Toughness of a Spray DepositedAlCu5 MgAgTi Alloy by Optimized Heat Treatments and ThermomechanicalTreatments 

 Optimized heat treatments and thermomechanical treatments are developed in order to improve strength and toughness of a spray deposited AlCu$_{5} alloy. Compared with the conventionally peak aged T6-temper, fracture toughness can be considerably increased by a two step ageing treatment, whereas strength is slightly lowered. However, simultaneous improvement of both fracture toughness and yield strength results from thermomechanical treatments, thus excellent combinations of fracture toughness and yield strength are achieved (Rp0.2 = 532 MPa and KIC = 47 MPam0.5). Further investigations revealed that even higher yield strengths (Rp0.2>575 MPa) can be achieved with stronger mechanical deformation. In this case fracture toughness is sacrificed. Microstructure investigation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that the AlCu$_{5}alloy is strengthened by comparable amounts of precipitates of the type Omega and Theta prime. However, in accordance with the different mechanical poperties of the various tempers, evident quantitative and qualitative differences in the precipitation state are observed. Compared with the original T6-temper the total amount of Omega and Theta prime is decreased in the two step aged material, but the precipitates are much foner. The thermomechanically treated material shows the finest precipitate size along with the highest precipitate densities.
