  Plant-herbivore-microbe interactions in Soybean 
This project explores the interactions of soybean plants with insect her-  bivores and microbial pathogens and mutualists; specifically, how plant associations with rhizobia and other soil microbes influences plant resistance to insect herbivores and pathogens and the cues that guide insect foraging.
This project explores the complex interactions of soybean plants with insect herbivores and microbial pathogens and mutualists. Specifically, we are exploring how plant associations with rhizobia and and other soil microbes influences plant resistance to insect herbivores and pathogens and the cues that guide insect foraging. Recent research in our lab has shown that the natural association of soybean roots with certain strains of nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria (e.g. Bradyrhizobia species) can enhance plant resistance to insect pests (aphids). Current work is exploring similar effects on plant-interactions with chewing herbivores including the bean leaf beetle and Mexican bean beetle, which are vectors of an economically important viral disease of soybeans, Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV).
