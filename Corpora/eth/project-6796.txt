  Polymers and Inorganic Materials: Nanocomposites  

 Systems of polymers and inorganic materials are wide-spread in technology and in daily life. For example, polymers are filled with inorganic particles in order to modify properties such as Young's modulus, electric or thermal conductivity, dimensional stability or abrasion resistance. Our work deals with polymers containing inorganic particles in a range of 1-100 nm (nanocomposites) and with basic investigations concerning adhesion. In contrast to composites with particles in the mm range, nanocomposites do not scatter light and are interesting for optical applications. We succeeded in the preparation of nanocomposites with refractive indices over the entire range of < 1 to > 3, by far the lowest and highest ever achieved for a polymer composite. We also have prepared transparent polymeric materials containing a surface layer of 100 nm of UV-absorbing nanocomposite to inhibit the degradation of the polymer by UV light.
