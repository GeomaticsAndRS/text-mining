  Planning Tool for WDM Networks  

Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is deployed to an increasing extent for point-to-point  connections in wide area networks (WAN) to satisfy the increasing demand for transmission capacity. This is accomplished by a change in traffic pattern from pure voice traffic and static demands to more and more data traffic with high dynamic. Therefore, the traditional circuit switching approach for WAN is no longer well suited and optical packet- or burst-switching is discussed. In the framework of the COST 266 action "Advanced Infrastructure for Photonic Networks", appropriate architectures for photonic networks of the next generation and the necessary key components are investigated. Novel management techniques and the adaptation of IP traffic to the transport layer with the ability to distinguish between service classes (QoS) with multi protocol label switching and multi protocol lambda switching are investigated. A step-wise migration of the existing networks is a challenging task, where new methods for the planning process are needed. Due to the high degrees of freedom, the network design process is often computer based. Algorithms, which were developed for the embedding of regular topologies in real networks, can be adapted for this purpose.
