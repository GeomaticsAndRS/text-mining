  The development of the high-throughput 3D electron microscopy 
We are developing a new technology for the mass production of the image acquisition and data analysis for the cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of the biological macromolecules.
This project aims to develope high-throughput data collection and data analysis electron cryomicroscopy and electron cryo-tomography to reconstruct 3D structure of biological macromolecules. So far we have established three-dimensional image alignment, classification and reconstruction. Results We applied our methodology for 3D structural analysis of eukaryotic flagella. We revealed molecular arrangement on microtubule doublets, especially arrangement of inner and outer arm dyneins. Bui, K.H., Sakakibara, H., Movassagh, T., Oiwa, K. and Ishikawa, T. (2008) J.
