  Magnetic and thermodynamic properties of non-stoichiometric Fe-based mineral phases  
The project aims to establish a link between chemistry, structure and magnetic thermodynamics in non-stoichiometric minerals using Nb-ilmenite and 4C pyrrhotite as examples. Natural and synthetic samples are compared to obtain a model for magnetic ordering processes in non-stoichiometric compounds.
