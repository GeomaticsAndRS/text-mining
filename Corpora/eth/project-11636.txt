  Rapid cooling of seed tempered chocolates  
Fat continuous multiphase systems like chocolates are seeded with specific fat crystal polymorphs and the crystal growth kinetics is investigated under rapid cooling conditions. Crystallisation kinetics and resulting polymorph distribution as function of the cooling conditions are investigated. This
