  TH - Non-Locality and Applications to Communication, Cryptography, and Distributed Computing 

clearly, processing, transmitting, and stoAccording to Landauer [12], Sinformation ¸ is physicalT; ring information are ultimately physical processes. A consequence of this insight is that the laws of quantum physics, for instance, lead to lower bounds on the size of (classical) computing devices. ° It has, on the other hand, been shown in the 1980Ss that certain effects from quantum physicsU° such as superposition, interference, and, in particular, entanglementUcan be used in computation or, more generally, information processing in a beneficiary way: Certain tasks can be realized more efficiently by a computing device which exploits the effects of quantum physics than by a computer. Examples of such tasks are to find the prime factorization of a given (large) Sclassical ¸ T ° integer or the computation of so-called discrete logarithmsUtwo very specific problems which are, however, of great importance since solving them efficiently allows for breaking most public-key cryptographic schemes used in practice today. Interestingly, there even exist problems from information processing which can be shown to be unsolvable classically, but that can be solved when quantum physics is taken into account. An example is the generation of cryptographic keys by public communication in such a way that even a computationally unbounded eavesdropper cannot obtain any (non-negligible) information about the key. Another example is the possibility of carrying out specific distributed tasks with much ° less communication than would be required classicallyUand even no communication at all in some ° casesUbetween parties sharing quantum information, i.e., partitioning certain bi- or multi-partite quantum states which are entangled. In general terms, the main goals of the proposed project are to better understand quantum phy° ° sical phenomenaUand the possibilities they offer for information processingUby studying them from an information-theoretic viewpoint, to find new functionalities which can be realized using quantum physics but not classically, and to enlighten the relationship between different primiti° ° ves and functionalities fromUquantum and classicalUinformation processing, in partic ular from cryptography. The practical implications range from the possibility of more efficient (distributed) ° ° secrecy codes provabcomputation to the practical realizationUpossibly in the very near futureUof ly unbreakable even by arbitrarily powerful adversaries, as well as the implementation, in the same sense, of secure collaboration between parties distrusting each other.
