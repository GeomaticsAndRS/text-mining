  The mechanism of Stress Corrosion Cracking  

A very large data base of reliable stress corrosion crack growth rates in metallic  materials under various conditions (most of these data obtained at the Institute of Metallurgy) is the starting point to develop a model which shall be able to explain and predict important influential parameters on stress corrosion cracking. The temperature dependence of stress corrosion cracking is one such important parameter for the mechanism responsible for cracking. Therefore, a major effort is made to study this temperature dependence in various metallic systems under various environmental conditions, combined with the effect of other metallurgical influences, such as the structure of the material and its mechanical properties.
