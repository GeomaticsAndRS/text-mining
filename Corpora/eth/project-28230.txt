  Elucidating the biological function of FUS and its role in neurodegeneration  
Aims: understanding mutations of proteins with roles in RNA metabolism implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as FUS (fused in sarcoma); reveal structural basis of FUS-RNA interactions to gain new insight into the connection between misregulated RNA metabolism and neurodegeneration
