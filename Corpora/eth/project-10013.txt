  CLIMAN: Holocene climate variability and the evolution of human settlement in the Aral Sea Basin  
The project aims at establishing the sequence of climate changes over the last 15 ka in the Aral Sea Basin. It focusses on the analyses of multiple proxies recording pluvialaridic oscillations, which control lake level changes in the Aral Sea.
