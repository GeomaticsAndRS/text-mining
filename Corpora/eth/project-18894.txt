  Transparency and Communication of Central Banks  
We examine which information should be published by central banks. We analyze the question whether transparent or opaque committees yield better policy outcomes. We also examine the means by which central banks should communicate and which information central banks should collect. 
We examine which information should be published by central banks. In this regard, we also analyze the general question whether transparent or opaque committees yield better policy outcomes. A further research topic relates to the means by which central banks should communicate. Moreover, we analyze which information a central bank should collect. Specific issues: Should central banks publish their estimates about economic shocks? Should central banks publish details about their preferences? Should committees, for example monetary policy committees, publish details about decisionmaking, in particular voting records? Is the publication of policy intentions desirable? Should central banks collect information about real shocks directly if the information could be obtained by observing prices?
