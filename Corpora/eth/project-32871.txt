  Supported silver and gold nanoparticles for selective three-phase hydrogenation of acetylenic substrates  
This work evaluates the performance of silver and gold-based catalysts in the gas and three-phase hydrogenation of alkynes, an important reaction for the purification of  olefin streams and the manufacture of fine chemicals.
