  Sustainable intensification of cocoa agroforestry systems  
This project explores the benefits of agroforestry for sustainable cocoa production by investigating the effects of shade trees on soil properties. We investigate the effects of individual trees with a focus on their tree traits and quantify effects of increases in tree cover at the system scale.
