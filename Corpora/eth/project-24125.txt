  N2O emission from wastewater treatment: Identification of microbial processes based on isotopic signature and reduction strategies  
In biological wastewater treatment N2O is produced during nitrogen de-  gradation and stripped to the atmosphere having a negative impact on the environment (climate change, ozone depletion). The goal of this project is to better understand the relevant processes and to develop reduction strategies.
