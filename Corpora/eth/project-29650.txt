  ECOWAX: Evaluating the variability of ecosystem water vapour fluxes and spatiotemporal effects of extreme events 
This project is ’Evaluating the variability of ecosystem water vapour fluxes and spatiotemporal effects of extreme events’ using a synthesis dataset of the global measurement network FLUXNET in combination with a novel biophysical process model (BESS) to upscale ecosystem fluxes globally.
