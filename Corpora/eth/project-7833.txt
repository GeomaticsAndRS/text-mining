  Photorefractive Effects in the Ultraviolet  

 There is a great interest for materials showing photorefractive properties in the ultraviolet spectral region. With respect to the visible, the advantages of ultraviolet light are shorter response times as well as an increased resolution and storage capacity for holographic memory applications. Several materials including LiTaO$_{3}$, LiNbO$_{3}$, and few compounds belonging to the BBO family are being investigated in order to optimize the ultraviolet holographic performance. We have also found that holographic gratings can be efficiently written in pure KNbO$_{3}$crystals ~ with UV light (\gl340-360 nm) making use of the direct interband photoexitation of electron-hole pairs. The gratings are robust, meaning that they are not influenced by intense beams at longer wavelengths, and their build-up times are of the order of \gms, which is 10 times faster than the fastest effect measured in the visible range. The thickness and amplitude of photorefractive gratings created by interband photoexcitation and the dynamic behaviour can be controlled with few parameters like the UV and probe beam intensity, the grating spacing and the dc applied field. Undoped crystals can be used and no special material preparation is required. For these reasons interband photorefractive effects are promising for future applications. Optical correlators or beam steering devices in optical waveguides may make use of this effect.
