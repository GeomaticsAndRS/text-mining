  Multifunctional Trilayer Heterostructures 
We investigate reversible symmetry tuning in functional thin-film (A/B/A) oxides. Such "trilayers" feature a model system to exploit and control symmetry related functionalities as (e.g. magnetoelectric effects) in heterostructure devices. 
One versatile way to induce new symmetry related functionalities in thin film heterostructures is to evoke a well-defined symmetry reduction by the composition of the individual layers, as e.g. (A/B/C) superlattices in so-called "tricolor" systems [1,2]. Unfortunately, such a compositional symmetry breaking necessarily is immutable, i.e. it is an irreversible material property that can no longer be modified after completion of growth. In order to achieve reversible symmetry control, we study a novel property-based route to reversibly violate and recover the symmetry in artificial ferroic trilayer systems. For this purpose we design epitaxial ABA-type trilayers consisting of a functional La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (or SrRuO3) inter-layer that is enclosed by two ferroic control-layers (PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 or BiFeO3). By setting the relative orientation of the ferroic order parameters in the control layers we gain control of the trilayer inversion symmetry. In our scheme the order parameter is inverted by the electric field of a charged atomic force microscope tip, while the "global" trilayer symmetry is determined from its nonlinear optical response.
