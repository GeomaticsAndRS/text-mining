  Non-Perturbative Analysis of Quantum Electrodynamics with Non-RelativisticMatter 

 A mathematically precise, non-perturbative theory of the interactions between atoms or molecules and the quantized radiation field is developed. Existence and properties of groundstates and life times and decay modes of excited states of atoms and molecules are investigated, using a new operator-theoretic form of the renormalization group. The structure of resonances is analyzed. Spectral properties of the Hamiltonian of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics are established. In the future, we plan to analyze the temporal behaviour and the decay modes of unstable states in more detail, using a time-dependent Feshbach method, and we plan to investigate the ultraviolet renormalizability of the theory, using renormalization group techniques. The main aim of this work is foundational, but implications for concrete problems in quantum optics are imaginable.
