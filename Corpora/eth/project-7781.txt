  Large Angle Bhabha Cross Section and Forward-Backward Asymmetry 

 The couplings of the electroweak neutral current to electrons are studied in the production of electron-positron pairs at the highest center-of-mass energies reached with LEP2. This is the richest LEP production channel, where contributions from s-channel diagrams, t-channel diagrams and their interference are present. The L3 detector is used to measure the total and the differential cross section and the forward-backward asymmetry for large angle Bhabha scattering. Special attention is paid to the experimental aspects of the measurement in the central tracking system and the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters. A procedure to extract results for s-channel processes is developed. The measurements are compared to the Standard Model predictions. A search is performed for new high energy phenomena that could manifest themselves as deviations from the measured differential cross section.
