  Towards a fully synthetic substitute of alginate: optimization of a thermal gelation/chemical cross-linking scheme (tandem"gelation) for the production of beads and liquid-core capsules  
Fully synthetic polymers were used for the preparation of hydrogel beads and capsules, in a processing scheme that, originally designed for calcium alginate, was adapted to a "tandem" process, that is the combination a physical gelation with a chemical cross-linking.
