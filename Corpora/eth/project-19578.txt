  Verification of diffusion-weighted imaging and nerve fiber tracking  
Diffusion-weighted imaging measures restricted water diffusion in the  brain. Firstly, quantitative measures can be extracted that exhibit markers in pathological states. Secondly, virtual nerve fibers can be reconstructed. Verification of these results is an important ongoing research subject.
