  Verification of diffusion-weighted imaging and nerve fiber tracking  
Diffusion-weighted imaging measures restricted water diffusion in the  brain. Firstly, quantitative measures can be extracted that exhibit markers in pathological states. Secondly, virtual nerve fibers can be reconstructed. Verification of these results is an important ongoing research subject.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables the measurement of restricted water diffusion in the human brain. DTI provides quantitative measures which reflect the underlying tissue properties and exhibit markers in pathological states. However, DTI data is fairly difficult to interpret in biological tissue as many factors affect the diffusion process and the MR signal. In addition to scalar diffusion parameters, the recently developed technique fiber tracking shows great promise for investigating the architecture of brain white matter. Presently, it is the only technique that enables in-vivo investigation of nerve fibers. Therefore, verification of diffusion parameters and derived virtual axonal projections is an important ongoing research topic. Methods will be developed that enable in vivo as well as ex vivo investigation of results derived from diffusion-weighted imaging techniques.
