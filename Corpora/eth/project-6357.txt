  Occupational Health - Influence of environmental stressors on task performance and on breathing patterns  

 Environmental stressors are often encountered in everyday working life such as noise, odors, vibrations and so on. This raises the question if environmental stressors may impair performance and which psychophysiological mechanism is underlying such impairments. Influences of odors on human behavior and mental performance are phenomena that are generally accepted, despite the lack of scientific proof. In laboratory settings we explore the effects of pleasant and unpleasant odors of different concentrations on performance and also assess respiratory and affective responses. Main questions of this study are: is performance disruption depending on the ongoing task? Is performance decrement depending on the hedonic tone of the odor stimulus and/or its intensity? Are differences in task performance accompanied by specific short- or long-term changes in respiration?
