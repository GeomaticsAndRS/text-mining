  Reengineering of Project Management Processes in the Building Sector 

 The efficiency of the building industry depends largely on the organisation and operation of building projects. Our study aims at innovating project management by reengineering important management processes. In a first step we analyse the potentials of new organisational concepts (such as Virtual Organisations, interdisciplinary team work) and modern management and engineering concepts (such as Change Lean Risk Quality Information Management, Simultaneous Engineering) for the reengineering of management processes in the building sector. Also the potentials of available information and communication technologies will be examined. In a second part of the study the strengths and weaknesses of current project management methodology and practice will be examined with respect to the above mentioned concepts. In a third step we will develop a reengineering concept for a selected project management process.
