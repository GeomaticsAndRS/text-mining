  Damage-tolerant bulk metallic glasses  
Damage-tolerant bulk metallic glasses exhibiting both high strength and high fracture toughness would be suitable candidates for structural applications. The aim of this project is to investigate the main compositional, processing and structural parameters determining  such damage tolerance.
