  Porous nitrogen-doped carbon materials generated from fractal gels for CO2 capture  
Pyrolysis of shear induced gelation of nitrogen-containing colloidal particles produced in a chain-growth polymerization. The aim is to introduce porosity while maintaining the nitrogen content, which is key to achieve high CO2 binding capacity.
The key feature of our technique is that the prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbons possess welldesigned nano-porosity and meso-porosity. This precise and defined porosity is achieved combining pyrolysis and colloidal knowledge. In terms of diffusion, interconnected large pores are formed to permit a better access to smaller ones. In conclusion, this process should give us the possibility to tune the two types of pores, large and small, in order to minimize diffusion limitations. The most used NCPs are the random copolymer between styrene and acrylonitrile (SAN) where the second monomer is our main nitrogen source or pure polyacrilonitrile (PAN), with or without crosslinker. Different techniques are reported in the literature; for example, polymers are treated with ammonia to physically add nitrogen into their structure or by chemical activation of high nitrogen-containing precursors. [1, 2] Since we focus on polymers containing nitrogen and the process, which cancels a bottom-up step, is economically more attractive, the latter approach is adopted in this project. However, instead of using chemicals to create pores, we will apply thermal treatment. [3, 4] Our working materials are consequently based on SAN and PAN, either pure or in a core/shell structure.
