  Porous nitrogen-doped carbon materials generated from fractal gels for CO2 capture  
Pyrolysis of shear induced gelation of nitrogen-containing colloidal particles produced in a chain-growth polymerization. The aim is to introduce porosity while maintaining the nitrogen content, which is key to achieve high CO2 binding capacity.
