  Predicting regional crop production in response to climate extremes  
‚ÄùUsing the DAYCENT model, the research project aims to predict how climate change/extremes likely affect crop production and soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  at the regional scale, considering a range of biophysical constraints in Switzerland, under conventional and alternative mgmt adaptation.
