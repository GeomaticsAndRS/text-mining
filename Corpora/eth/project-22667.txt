  Early Science Learning: Implementing a learning environment on Sinking and Floating based on comparison processes  

This a design-based research project that involves the implementation and evaluation of a complex learning environment in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade addressing the scientific topic In order to help ensure the validity of results from an implementation of Sfloating ¸ and sinkingT. in a natural classroom environment, we conducted experimental research on childrenSs prior understanding of the concept. Thus, the experimental study allowed us to adjust the implemented learning environment to childrenSs intuitive understanding. The intervention is realized in a joint effort of researchers, pre-service and in-service teachers. Preliminary results show that at the end of our intervention, both preschool and primary school children were able to produce significantly more correct predictions about the floating and sinking of objects, while their reasoning reflected a more elaborated concept of knowledge than before the intervention.
