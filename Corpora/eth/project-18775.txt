  High field in-vivo 13C MR spectroscopy 
13C MRS shall be established at 3T and 7T. Improved decoupling se-  quences and polarization transfer techniques for SNR enhancement and localization and the development of an absolute quantitation method will be developed. Neurotransmitter cycling, muscle lactate and glycogen shall be observed.
