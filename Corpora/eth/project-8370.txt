  SDiversity ¸ and heterologous expression of CYP153 family P450 alkane  hydroxylasesT  
PCR with highly degenerate primers specific for CYP153 alkane hydroxylases was used to investigate the diversity and occurence of this class of enzymes in various environments. Succesfull functional expression of several CYP153s was obtained in P. putida and P. fluorescens.
