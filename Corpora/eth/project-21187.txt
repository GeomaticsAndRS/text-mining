  Membrane Formation and Self-assembling on Microfluidic Platforms  

Three-dimensional (3D) lipid membrane structures such as vesicles and tubes are a versatile tool in analytical chemistry, biology, pharmacy, and micro-/nanotechnology. They could serve as sensors, as containers for transport and delivery of sample, and as reaction vessels for conducting biochemical processes. Moreover, due to similarities in size and membrane composition, 3D lipid structures are simple models for cells and cell organelles. is the formation and application of biomimetic lipid memThe goal of the project Sn ¸ µ -LIPIDST brane structures by means of micro- and nanotechnologies. In general, lipid membranes can be created by self-assembly of lipid molecules. However, the structures formed in such bottom-up approach are limited in size, morphology and complexity. Microsystems technology advances the level of control by predefining size, location, number, shape and architecture of the formed objects. Under the condition of laminar flow, the formation process is reproducible, and peculiar structures with cylindrical, tubular and helical forms remain stable. Furthermore, the micro- and nanostructured chips are also a perfect tool due to similar dimensionalitiesto directly analyze and handle the objects.
