  Tate Cohomology and Homology for Arbitrary Groups  

An extension of classical Tate cohomology groups to infinite groups  is being investigated. Besides of the study of generalizations of the classical spectral sequences, some concrete computations are attempted. A Tate homology theory is being developed and its properties are analyzed.
