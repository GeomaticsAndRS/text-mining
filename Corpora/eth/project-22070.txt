  Identification of candidate therapeutic targets by quantitative analysis of the cell surface proteome of drug resistant childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia  
In this project we combine preclinical expertise with a unique model of de novo drug resistant ALL with innovative quantitative proteomic technologies to determine for the first time the subproteome on the cell surface of leukemic cells as a prerequisite for diagnostic  clinical applications.
