  Valence Band Mixing in Quantum Well Structures  

Since essentially all the electronic and optical properties of semiconductor devices are  dependent upon the bandstructure, it is important to adopt a proper formulation to calculate the latter. For III-IV bulk structures, a parabolic description is sufficient to describe states near the band edge. But in quantum wells, since the holes are strongly confined, there is a strong coupling between light hole and heavy hole bands so that one cannot use the uncoupled Schrödinger equation. A program has been written to calculate the valence band structure in III-IV quantum wells, including valence band mixing. The Kohn-Luttinger formulation has been adopted to compute the dispersion E$_{k}$.
