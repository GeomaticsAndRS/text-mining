  Design of Median Crossings on Divided Highways  

The aim of the project is to draw up the bases for a new design standard for median  crossings on divided highways geared to a speed of 80 km per hour. The design recommendations are based on measurements of speed and lane-driving behavior at existing crossings and on comparisons of these measurements with calculations of theoretic driving dynamics. The intention is to produce recommendations on the geometric configuration of median crossings and their structural and operational equipment and to establish criteria for their installation.
