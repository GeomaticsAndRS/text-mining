  Establishing Permanence in REDD+ Schemes 
REDD+ is a policy that seeks to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere by paying for the conservation of forests that are at risk of being cut in developing countries.  The project's objective is to assess different payment design options that could help ensure permanence.
Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD or REDD+) is a policy that seeks to reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere by making payments for the conservation of forests that are at risk of being cut or degraded in developing countries. An important condition for the effectiveness of the approach is that the forests, and the carbon stored therein, are safeguarded for several decades. Ensuring such permanence is a major challenge in REDD scheme design. The objective of this project is to assess different payment design options that could help ensure permanence. In a first phase factors, potentially constraining permanence will be identified. In the second phase, different payment modalities that could counteract the constraining factors and promote permanence will be assessed. For empirical relevance, a stated choice experiment on different scheme design options will be conducted in the context of a pilot REDD+ project: the "Kasigau Corridor REDD ProjectS ¸ in Kenya.
