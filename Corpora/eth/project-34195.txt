  Bootstrapping Distributional Semantics from the Web 
Learning word embeddings from Web corpus data.
Using a Web Corpus we want to bootstrap semantic representations for word n-grams in order to induce a similarity measure between text fragments such as search queries. In order to address the sparseness problem for rare n-grams, we propose to employ a compositional model for lexical semantics, which constructs semantic representations of compounds recursively from those of its constituents. We bootstrap compositional representations in a completely task-independent and unsupervised manner.
