  Gas sensors and electronic nose on flexible substrates 
This project is focussed on the fabrication on gas sensors and gas sensor arraays, so called electronic noses, on plastic substrates. The sensors are low cost and flexible/bendable and can be positioned to any surface. Special application area of these sensors is the integration into smart textiles.
