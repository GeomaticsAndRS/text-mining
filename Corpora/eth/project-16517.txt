  Effect of short-term exposure of children to high altitude  
We studied the short-term adaptation of 9-12 year old prepubertal children to 3450m in comparison to their fathers. Maximal aerobic performance, pulmonary function, hypoxic ventilatory response, cardiac function, etc were measured in 20 child father pairs in Zurich and at Jungfraujoch during 3 days.
