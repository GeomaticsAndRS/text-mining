Current land-use in the regions of Davos, Jura (Vaud) and Visp (Valais) is investigated. Afterwards changes in land-use are simulated until 2100 using a spatial explicit landuse model based on linear programming. Sensitivity analyses concerning commoditiy markets and climate change are carried out.
