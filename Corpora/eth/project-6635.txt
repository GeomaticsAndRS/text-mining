  CGAL - Constructing a Geometric Algorithms Library  

 The ultimate goal of the CGAL project is to make the large body of geometric algorithms, developed within the field of computational geometry, available for industrial application. To this end we will follow three paths. - We will develop a C++ library named CGAL (pronounce "seagull") that consists of a kernel of geometric data types and operations, a collection of geometric algorithms for both 2-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems, and a support library for visualisation and I/O. The library must be robust, efficient, general, and easily maintainable. - We will cooperate with ten industrial collaborators on the applicability of CGAL in their work on geographic information systems, visualisation and simulation, CAD/CAM, and shape analysis and reconstruction. - We will perform theoretical and experimental research on implementation aspects of geometric algorithms. In the first 1.5 years of the project we will deliver first implementations of data structures and algorithms, and study the applicability of CGAL in the application domains.
