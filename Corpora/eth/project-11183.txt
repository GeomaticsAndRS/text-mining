  Asymmetric cell division and aging 
Recent studies indicate that cellular aging is the consequence of genomic instability. Remarkably, the deleterious products of this instability are not equivalently inherited by all daughters, allowing to the formation of an ”eternal” lineage. We investigate the role of spindle asymmetry in this pro
