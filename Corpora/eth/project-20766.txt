  Role of microfluctuations in power of human crystalline lens 
We develop an artefact-free instrument to investigate microfluctuations (MF) in power of the human crystalline lens. MF are then studied in terms of their role in driving visual accommodation and in terms of their role as an objective indicator for visual fatigue.
