  SNon-coding ¸ RNAs and their role in Escherichia coli biotechnologyTˇ  
The prime goal is to gain an insight into the role the novel non-coding RNAs could play in E. coli. We investigate their cellular activities, mechanisms and biotechnological applications, which include improved growth properties and metabolic activities, elevated protein expression and secretion lev
