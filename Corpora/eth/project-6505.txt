  Demand oriented Forest Management  

Model based calculations show that under present costs and earnings a decrease of the revolution  time will generate losses. Plausible changes in costs and earnings have a strong impact on the situation. In the future one needs up-dated management concepts which should rely more on the economical orientation of the forest enterprise, with a clearer separation of forest functions, and shorter revolution time. This concerns particularly saw timber of spruce under favourable cost conditions. The model-based calculations are used for simulations in case studies and yield indications for a new strategic orientation.
