  Time Resolved Nonlinear Optical Investigations in the Picosecond andNanosecond Range 

 Time resolved measurements of degenerate four-wave mixing is used to characterize different nonlinear processes induced by short intense laser pulses. Three different wavelengts can be used for excitation and probing: the Nd:YAG fundamental, second- and third-harmonics, that is 1064, 532, and 355 nm, respectively. In different modifications of the set-up we can distinguish between dissipative and nondissipative processes, and temporally resolve the mechanism of transport and trapping of generated free charge carriers. The quasi instantaneous response is also investigated to determine the cascading contribution of second order nonlinearities to the third order nonlinear susceptibility. A definite understanding of all the effects measured is not possible yet. Current experiments are: nanosecond response measurements in unreduced KNbO$_{3}$with the help of cw erasure of quasi-permanent gratings, photorefractive response measurements from \gms to ms time range for the characterisation of trapping centres, temperature dependence of the effects to determine the mobility of photoexcited electrons. To describe the ns effects we are developping an explanation based on the photorefractive behaviour, in terms of the usual band-conduction model, adding the effects like light induced absorption and other non-electro-optic contributions to the refractive index change.
