  Droplet-based microfluidic screening of protein over-expression in cancerous cells 

Many diseases, including cancers are caused by over-regulation of a certain protein pathway. This results in an increased concentration of specific proteins within the cell that can be studied and correlated to the disease state. Accordingly, there is a growing effort to find efficient rapid screening methods for cancers, whilst limiting the amount of sample required. Protein screening can be performed in droplet-based microfluidic chips.(1) Such systems typically use picolitre and nanolitre sized droplets of aqueous sample dispersed in an immiscible phase. The key advantage of this approach is the possibility of recreating almost any type of reaction with a minimal amount of sample and in high-throughput. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be identified using a number of methods: co-purification, yeast two hybrid screening, protein fragment complementarity assays and protein microarray chips. In droplet-based microfluidic systems fluorescence detection techniques can be used to identify PPIs.(2) In this project protein specific purification techniques will be used to carry out screening. Proteins of interest can be specifically extracted with the help of magnetic beads that carry a respective antigen on their surface. PPIs can then be studied by immobilization of a given protein and capture of its interaction counterparts. These can be conjugated with fluorescent probes that will report the presence of the protein of interest. Droplet manipulations will be performed using a range of functional components integrated within chip-based devices and cell/reagent loading will be implemented using a custom made robotic encapsulation device. 1) Chemical Biology, 2010, 26, 229. 2) ChemBioChem, 2009, 10, 1605.
