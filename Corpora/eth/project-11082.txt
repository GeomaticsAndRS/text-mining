  SOSTOOLS: a sum of squares optimization toolbox  
A free MATLAB toolbox for formulating and solving sums of squares (SOS) optimization programs. SOSTOOLS can be used to specify and solve sum of squares polynomial problems using a very simple, flexible, and intuitive high-level notation.
SOSTOOLS: In collaboration with colleagues at Caltech, we have developed SOSTOOLS, a free MATLAB toolbox for formulating and solving sums of squares (SOS) optimization programs. These provide a natural and very powerful generalization of several known convex optimization problem classes. SOSTOOLS can be used to specify and solve sum of squares polynomial problems using a very simple, flexible, and intuitive high-level notation. It provides a user-friendly implementation of the newly developed analysis methods. It is under active development, with several new improvements already in the works.
