  Chemo-poro-mechanical modelling of swelling sulfatic rocks  
In order to improve understanding of the swelling phenomenon we develop a model on the basis of the theory of mixtures that considers a series of processes such as seepage flow, water adsorption by the clay minerals, chemical transport, dissolution of anhydrite and growth of gypsum crystals.
