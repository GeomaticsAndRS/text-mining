  Development of new ligation and cross-coupling reactions  
A remaining problem in protein synthesis and bioconjugation is the relatively slow rate of the intermolecular coupling reactions. We have recently made the first steps towards identifying a new generation of chemical ligation reactions that may eventually address this Srate ¸ problemT.
