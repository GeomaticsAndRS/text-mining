  Preparation and Basic Investigation of Photorefractive Crystals withDifferent Dopants 

 Availability of semiconductor lasers which operate in the near-infrared spectral region has stimulated research of photorefractive materials usefull at these wavelengths. Different nonlinear optical components, such as holographical memories, optical image amplifiers, spatial light modulators, and optical diodes, which could be based on the photorefractive effect in the near infrared spectral range are a target of intensive research. Previous experiments have also demonstrated that holographic gratings can be written in pure KNbO$_{3}$crystals with UV light. We produce doped and pure KNbO$_{3}$crystals for photorefractive applications and investigate them. Beside the efforts directed in producing fast photorefractive KNbO$_{3}$, we are interested in extending the photorefractive response of KNbO$_{3}$in the near infrared spectral range. We follow the approach that different dopants should be tried to induce the appropriate electron energy levels in KNbO$_{3}$, the levels which will insure good photoconduction and a high enough density of empty traps. The top-seeded high-temperature solution growth method is used and the impurities are introduced in the melt in the form of oxides. Post-growth treatment of boules in controlled atmosphere is also implemented to control the oxygen stoichiometry. Up to now, by combination of the doping and post growth treatment we were able to improve the holographic sensitivity by one order of magnitude in the visible, and by four orders of magnitude in the infrared.
