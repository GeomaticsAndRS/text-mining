  Binding Mechanisms of Zinc with Cement Minerals  

The use of alkaline cements for waste treatment especially for the disposal of heavy metal  rich inorganic wastes is a well-established technology. In Switzerland, the mixing of filter ashes from the incineration of municipal solid waste with cement and the disposal in mono landfills is a common practice. However, little is known about the interaction of heavy metals and cement minerals. In this project, we investigate the binding mechanisms of heavy metals with cement minerals. Zinc and calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH), the main constituent of hardened cement, are used as model substances. In this system, we try to determine the binding mechanisms of importance. The possible mechanisms are: Specific Adsorption, Ion Exchange, Formation of Solid Solutions and (Surface-) Precipitation of pure or mixed solid phases. In order to identify the mechanisms in our system, we carry out sorption and solubility experiments. Different techniques are used for the analysis of the liquid and the solid phases before and after the experiments. First results of this study can be found in: Ludwig, Chr., Ziegler, F., Johnson, C.A.: Heavy metal binding mechanisms in cement-based waste materials.

The final results will be published in 1999 in form of a Ph.D.Thesis at ETH Zürich.
