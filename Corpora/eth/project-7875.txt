  Gain-Clamped Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers for the 1.3Wavelength Range with NewLaser Reflector Configuration  

 Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA's) in the 1.3\gmm wavelength range are of great interest for capacity upgrades and further exploitation of the installed fiber base. High-capacity communication systems will employ high-density wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) techniques. However, multichannel amplification using SOA's can cause system penalties due to nonlinear signal distortions and interchannel crosstalk. We have demonstrated gain-clamped SOA's at 1.3\gmm wavelength, with a new laser reflector configuration, that, while significantly reducing the nonlinear signal distortions and multichannel crosstalk, achieves high, polarization insensitive fiber-to-fiber gain and large unsaturated output power. These gain-clamped semiconductor optical amplifiers consist of a regular, high gain, polarization insensitive travelling-wave semiconductor optical amplifier (TW-SOA) that is coupled to an external cavity consisting of a high reflectivity fiber-written Bragg grating and an uncoated taper-lensed fiber tip. This configuration suppresses the backward travelling laser signal, thus avoiding the need of an optical bandpass filter at the input. Furthermore a low quality factor of the laser cavity insures clamping of the gain at a high level.
