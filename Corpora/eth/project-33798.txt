  Example-Based Geometry Brush 
Investigation of a general procedural geometry generation method combined with a brush-based painting technique, as commonly known in software packages like Blender  and Maya. The approach works on a wide spectrum of topologically different input exemplars, such as surfaces and discrete elements.
In this research project we investigate a general procedural geometry generation method. We combine a brush-based geometry painting technique with discrete element textures, a recent examplebased approach for texture synthesis with discrete elements, proposed by Ma et al. [SIGGRAPH 2011]. A study on the energy of the problem is presented, as well as extensions such as control sampling and preserving global continuity. Our editing framework provides artists with maximum control over the generated content and produces valid results on a wide spectrum of topologically different input exemplars, such as continuous surfaces and non-manifold structures. Properties of the brush such as size and direction are exploited to add flexibility while synthesizing the output structure. Different results and applications are presented to validate the generality of the approach. The framework might be included as a plugin in software packages such as Blender.
