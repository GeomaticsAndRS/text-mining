  Robust catalysts for the production of solar methanol under fluctuating conditions  
Based on a solar-induced thermochemical splitting of CO2 and H2O, syngas (CO/CO2/H2) can be produced which can subsequently be converted into methanol. Herein, we aim at identifying a solid catalyst which displays stable performance in spite of the huge fluctuations in availability and composition o
