  Bayesian techniques for model calibration and stochastic inverse problems 
Bayesian methods are developed for the calibration of computer codes (e.g. fit the input parameters to predict measured quantities) and for solving stochastic inverse problems (infer the variability of model input parameters through the observation of scattered indirect  measurements).
The framework of Bayesian statistics has been much used for a decade in the context of verification and validation (V&V), i.e. the calibration of computational codes (e.g. finite element models in structural mechanics) through experimental measurements. Numerical challenges remain though, since classical techniques (e.g. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation) are highly demanding in terms of computation time [1,2]. Similar algorithms may be used to solve stochastic inverse problems, i.e. problems for which the model input parameters are not directly measurable and should be identified from measurements of dependent quantities in the presence of uncertainty. The thesis will explore new approaches to tackle these challenging problems, taking full advantage of the recent developments in high performance computing. Sudret, B.
