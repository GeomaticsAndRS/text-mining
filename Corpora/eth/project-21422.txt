COMBEST will provide a formal framework for component based design of complex embedded systems. This framework will: Enable formal integration of heterogeneous components, such as with different models of communication or execution; Provide complete encapsulation of components both for functional and extrafunctional properties and develop foundations and methods ensuring composability of components; Enable prediction of emergent key system characteristics such as performance and robustness (timing, safety) from such characterizations of its subcomponents; Provide certificates for guarantees of such key system characteristics when deployed on distributed HW-architectures. To achieve these objectives, COMBEST will: c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved. Last updated: 06.08.2004 <page 2> Develop a design theory for complex embedded systems, fully covering heterogeneity, interface specifications, composability, compositionality, and refinement for functional and extra-functional properties; Build on substantial highly recognized background results of the academic partners, partly carried out within the integrated project SPEEDS; Extend results of the Integrated Project SPEEDS, both regarding heterogeneous rich components and compositional analysis methods.
