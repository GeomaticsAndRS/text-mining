  B-Anti-B Oscillations  

 The goal of this study is to measure the time period in which a neutral B meson transforms into its anti-particle, in an analogous way to the oscillations in the neutral Kaon system. In the case of the B system, this oscillation is directly related to the mass difference of the B and the anti B. To do this measurement, we look at the fraction of mixed B mesons to all B mesons as a function of the decay time. To know whether a B meson has mixed, we need to know its flavour at production and at decay time. The decay flavour is identified through the charge of a lepton coming out of a semileptonic decay of the B meson. For identifying the production flavour, several methods are being used. The first is to look at the sign of the lepton produced in the semileptonic decay of the other B meson produced in the event. The second approach makes use of the formation of resonant B meson states which decay very fast through the strong interaction. The products of this decay are used to identify the flavour of the B meson at production time. To study the fraction of B mesons as a function of time, we need a precise reconstruction of the decay length of the B mesons, making full use of the L3 central tracker, composed by a Time Expansion Chamber and a Silicon Microstrip Detector.
