  Astronomical Geodesy  
The scope of this project is to develop and apply easy-to-use equipments for astro-geodetic measurements of deflections of the vertical. The system consists of electronic  theodolites equipped with servo motors, a GPS timing receiver, a laptop computer, a first CCD adapter, and dedicated software.
DAEDALUS designates a measuring system which was designed and developed at the Geodesy and Geodynamics Lab (GGL) at ETH Zurich primarily for automated on-line astrogeodetic measurements. It consists of a small CCDa camera which can easily be clipped on a Total Station instead of the ordinary eye-piece, a pluggable front lens, a low-cost GNSS receiver, and dedicated software for steering, imaging and on-line processing. The system enables new possibilities for fully automated high-precision digital angle measurements, unaffected by human interference (personal equation).In addition to the detection and measurement of stars the software is capable to perform optical target recognition by using various image processing algorithms like least-squares template matching, circle recognition or center of mass operators. Although DAEDALUS was initially designed for astro-geodetic use, the results obtained reveal new and unexpected possibilities in other disciplines such as automated terrestrial and engineering surveying, deformation, vibration, and frequency analysis and photographic documentation. For applications where event timing is needed, high-precision time-tagged measurements are possible by means of a GNSS receiver. In the framework of a collaboration with Technical University of Budapest, the measurement towards Sun, Moon, and Planets has been implemented. Present investigations focus on the measurement of high precision astro-terrestrial azimuths in daytime.
