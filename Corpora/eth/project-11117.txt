  Protein phosphatase 1 in structural plasticity 
In light of the improving effect of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibition on learning and memory, we are examining whether this effect is accompanied by structural changes in the brain, based on the hypothesis that memory is associated with neuronal plasticity. Refined ultrastructural analyses are
