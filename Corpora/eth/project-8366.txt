  SInvestigation ¸ and application of a soluble alkane monooxygenase of Sphingomonas sp. HXN-200 for the regio- and stereoselective  hydroxylation of non-activated carbon atomsT  
The goal of this work is to isolate components of the P450 monooxygenase system of Sphingomonas sp. HXN 200. The enzyme system will be expressed in several hosts, and  the substrate range and biochemical proporties of the P450 monooxygenase will be characterized.
