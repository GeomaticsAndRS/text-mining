  The impact of globin proteins on pancreatic beta-cell survival  
Immune mediated processes contribute to pancreatic B-cell failure. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNFa & INFÎ³ are toxic to pancreatic islets, which are mediated by NO & other factors. The cytoprotective effect of NO-degrading globin proteins on beta-cell survival will be analyzed.
