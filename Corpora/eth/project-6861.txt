  Investigations of the Biopolymer PHB and of related Oligo(3-hydroxyalkanoates)  

 The biodegradable biopolymers poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate (P(3-HB)) and the copolymer poly-[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoate/(R)-3-hydroxyvalerate] (P(3-HB/HV)) are available by fermentation processes. 3-HB is used as starting material for the synthesis of linear oligomers by fragment coupling. The physical properties of these oligomers (OHB) are being determined in order to gain insight into the possible structure of a natural nonproteinogenic P(3-HB)-calcium-polyphosphate transmembrane ion-channel. The oligomers have also been incorporated into planar phospholipid bilayers and their electrophysiological properties have been examined. The synthesis of specifically 13C- and 2H-labelled OHBs has been achieved. These will be used for measurements with the goal of determining their solution structure. Oligo(3-hydroxyalkanoates), bearing the side chains of valine, alanine and leucine, have been prepared. The substituent pattern of these oligomers should allow for determination of the 3-dimensional structure in solution by NMR-methods. Double fluorescence-labelled HB-oligomers have also been synthesized, for the determination of the structure in solution, by Fluorescence-Resonance-Energy-Transfer (FRET). There is an intriguing class of biopolymers consisting of malic acid. This polyanionic compound is fully water soluble, and it is involved in the DNA replication of certain slime molds by complexing with the cationic DNA polymerase and histones. A stategy for the preparation of well defined oligomers of malic acid has been developed. Specifically, modified oligomers allowed us to determine the substrate specificity of an extracellular hydrolase of Physarum polycephalum.
