  Exfoliation Fracturing in the Central Alps  
The understanding of the mechanisms and timing of the formation of exfoliation fractures is still very poor and controversial. This project aims to improve our understanding and to provide the first comprehensive description of exfoliation fractures in the Central Swiss Alps (Grimsel-Aletsch Area). 
Much is known regarding the geometry of exfoliation fractures and sheets, but the understanding of the mechanisms and timing of their formation is still very poor and controversial. This project aims to improve our understanding in these fields and to provide the first comprehensive description of especially the Grimsel Pass exfoliation in the Central Swiss Alps. The study area of this project U is extremely well situated to study the 3D geometry of exfoliation fractures (both at ground area U surface and in subsurface galleries), to assess in-situ stress conditions, and to relate fracturing to glacial surfaces from different time periods. The key scientific goals for this PhD project are: T ¸ Investigate the spatial and relative age interrelationships of all sets of exfoliation fractures and their spatial occurrence in various topographic settings T ¸ Systematically map and characterize fractographic markings on exfoliation fractures in order to improve understanding of their formation mechanisms T ¸ Investigate the most probable stress and pore pressure conditions driving the formation of the observed exfoliation fractures T ¸ Test the applicability of proposed failure criteria (especially the tri-linear failure criterion from tunneling) for the observed sets of exfoliation fractures T ¸ Reconstruct paleo-surfaces from exfoliation fracture orientations and investigate age relationships between different fracture sets and glacial surfaces formed since the LGM.
