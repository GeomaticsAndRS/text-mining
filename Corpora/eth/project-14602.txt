  NanoShuttles: an active transport systems driven by biological motors 
Motor proteins are used by cells to transport molecular and cellular cargo to specified locations. Inspired by Nature, we are developing technologies to transport cargo along engineered micro and nanofabricated tracks driven by biological motors.
