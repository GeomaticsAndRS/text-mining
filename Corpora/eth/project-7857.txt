  Orientation dependence of the electro-optic effect in InP / InGaAsP  

High-speed optical waveguide switches are needed to switch the flow of information in fiber-optic  communication systems. The preferred material system is InGaAsP / InP because it allows integration of lasers, waveguides and detectors operating at wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55 \gmm. Major requirements for successful introduction of the switches into fiber-optic systems are polarization independent operation at multiple wavelengths in the 1.55 micron range, low optical losses, and low switching voltages allowing for high switching speeds. Polarization-insensitive operation of waveguide switches is obtained with our concept based on 2 x 2 Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI) with multimode interference splitter / combiner and specially oriented phase-shifting waveguides. Waveguide orientation is optimized such that polarization dependences of utilized Pockels (P) and Franz-Keldysh (FK) effects cancel. For a gap wavelength of 1.3 \gmm and an operating wavelength of 1.53 \gmm we found that the electrode orientation has to be 34\dg with respect to the direction for polarization insensitive switching.
