  Computer-assisted 3D models of protein-protein interaction domains involved in signaling pathway proteins  
The project aims at finding inhibitors of the Wnt transduction pathway. Such inhibitors can be used for the treatment of hyper-proliferative diseases such as cancer, in particular for the treatment of colon cancer.
