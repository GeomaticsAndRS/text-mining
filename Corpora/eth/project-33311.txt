  Physical model investigation of the bottom outlets of the GERD HEP  
In Ethiopia, the hydro power plant GERD (Grand Ethiopian Renaissance  Dam) is currently under construction. The two bottom outlets are investigated in a hydraulic model at VAW. Special focus is laid on the flow pattern, pressure distribution and cavitation hazard and scour formation in the d/s basin.
