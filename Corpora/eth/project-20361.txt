  Land-Climate Interactions: Modelling and Analysis 
Land-climate interactions play a key role in the climate system, in parti-  cular in transitional climate zones and mid-latitude regions. Our research focuses on their investigation using modelling experiments and observational data.
Land-climate interactions play a key role in the climate system, in particular in transitional climate zones and mid-latitude regions. They are relevant for short-term and seasonal forecasting, as well as for the analysis of extreme events and climate change. Despite their importance, land-climate interactions are still the subject of significant uncertainties. A major issue is the lack of observations (soil moisture, evapotranspiration), which impedes the understanding of the relevant processes and their necessary validation in climate models. Our research focuses on the following aspects: (1) Investigation of relevant feedbacks and interactions using regional and global climate modelling experiments (with regional and global climate models) (2) Process analysis based on existing observations and model data (3) Derivation of new observation-based datasets on land surface states and processes (soil moisture, snow, evapotranspiration) (4) Field measurements of relevant processes (soil moisture, evapotranspiration), test of new measurement strategies Web link: http://www.iac.ethz.ch/groups/seneviratne
