  Control method in selection forest  

This work investigates the optimization of inventory sampling schemes in selection forest,  an important question in order to replacing the existing full census system. The work rests upon two case studies in the Bernese Emmental with predominantly selection forests and on simulations performed on an artificial selection forest. Cost functions and stratification characteristics were based on the case studies, whereas the variance function were derived from the simulations. The post-stratification does not decrease significantly the variance. The optimal sample plots should be as large as possible (600 to 700 m2), placed on a rectangular grid with a length/breath ratio 1:3, 1:4. The use of concentric circles is questionable if the emphasis is on the estimation of the density of stems. (PhD Thesis Lubor Dvorak, completed July 2000)
