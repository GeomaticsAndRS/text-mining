  Estimation of operational costs of buildings  

 The user-specific forecasting and accounting of operational costs is considered a key issue for building owners, facility managers and building users. But current costing methods and tools only partially solve this problem . We aim to develop a practical method which is not too complicated but reliable enough for budgeting and accounting operational costs for residential, commercial and industrial buildings. Operational costs include the provision, maintenance and activity costs of a building. We would like to estimate operational costs not only for specific user units but for the whole building as well. A user unit encloses a distinct sector of a building and/or of the surrounding area. We intend to implement the envisaged method in a standard software environment and to demonstrate it with real and fictive cases. In the course of our study a number of problems have to be solved: - Calculating costs (i.e. energy costs) for user-units as a function of the spatial elements of the building - Reaching an acceptable standard deviation of the costing-result with a minimum of effort expended for information retrieval and calculation - Dealing with costs which do not depend directly on the building but on the owner (like the rent) or on external institutions (like energy prices) - Creating a controlling instrument to compare the "real" costs (based on physical and empirical facts) with the costs deduced from rules and existing contracts In cooperation with the CRB (Swiss research centre for rationalisation in building and civil engineering) we would like to incorporate existing data structures and costing methods in the study. The HVAC-department of the Engineering School in Lucerne (ZTL) supports the modelling of energy consumption.
