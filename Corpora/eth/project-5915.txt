  Heterologue Expression, Purification and Crystallisation of ActiveHerpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV 

Recombinant Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV 1) thymidine kinase (TK) was obtained from Escherichia coli using a thrombin cleavable fusion protein. The TK was expressed as an inducible glutathione S-acetyl transferase (GST) fusion protein and was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Cleavage with thrombin led to an irrelevant truncated enzyme, resulting from two new and hitherto unknown cleavage sites, determined by N-terminal sequencing. The TK could further be purified from the cleavage products by ATP affinity chromatography, yielding pure TK. Both, the fusion protein and the purified enzyme show enzymatic activity with the same KM-value of 0.25M for the natural substrate thymidine. Determination of the native molecular weight indicated, that the pure enzyme and the fusion protein are biologically active as homodimers. Therefore the recombinant enzyme has the same biochemical characteristics as the TK, expressed in virus infected cells, and can be used for crystallisation and so for experiment al structure determination, with the aim to develop new antiviral drugs.
