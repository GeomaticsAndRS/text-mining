  Suicide gene therapy in stem cell transplantation (Thymidine kinase controlled Graft-versus-host disease in Graft-versus-tumor therapy)  
Infusion of donor lymphocytes after allo-BMT allows achieving a higher graft versus tumor (GvT)effect. To control GvHD, an adverse effect of the cell therapy,lymphocytes are transduced ex vivo with the suicide gene HSV1 TK. The major goal of the research is to address the three clinical limitations.
