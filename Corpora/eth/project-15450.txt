  CO2 Capture from Atmospheric Air  
A novel solar thermochemical cycle for the capture of CO2 from air is analyzed. It encompasses 3 reactors: 1) a carbonator for capturing CO2 from air using a Ca(OH)2 aqueous solution; 2) a solar calciner for thermally decomposing CaCO3 into CaO; 3) a conventional slaker for regenerating Ca(OH)2.
Two approaches are examined: 1) a closed-material cycle that delivers pure CO2, and (2) an openmaterial cycle that, additionally, co-produces hydrogen. The 2nd approach features the same components as those of the closed-material cycle, except that the calciner co-produces CaO and syngas by the combined CaCO3-decomposion and CH4-reforming processes, and syngas is further processed to separate streams of H2 and CO2.
