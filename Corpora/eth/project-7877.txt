  Optical Wavelength Conversion with Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers  

All-optical wavelength converters have the potential to become key components in future  broadband, flexible multiplexed networks because they can be used as space switches to route signals to their destination by wavelength. We are investigating the implementation of wavelength conversion by mixing the information-carrying input signal and a pump optical frequency in a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). The two optical inputs mix, and due to the non-linear response of the semiconductor medium, some modulation side-bands are generated. The effect is called Four Wave Mixing (FWM) and results to a conversion at the difference frequency of the two inputs. The wavelength conversion by FWM in SOA's has the advantage of being transparent to the bit rate and the modulation format, and the short response-time of the underlying effects allows a large conversion range. On the other hand, the conversion efficiencies obtained experimentally with the FWM effect were up to now disappointingly low. We are designing and fabricating SOAs especially suited for FWM investigations. The devices are bulk InP/InGaAsP ridge waveguide amplifiers with lengths varying between 0.5 and 2 mm, polarisation asymmetry less than 2 dB and high fibre-to-fibre optical gains (i.e. 25 dB for the 0.5 mm long SOA). In a collaboration with the Fondazione Ugo Bordoni, Rome, in the frame of a COST project, detunings up to 4.3 THz were obtained which renders the devices attractive for large frequency translations. Very high efficiency has been obtained in long devices (1.5 mm) which gives this technique a practical interest in networks.
