  Uncertain Dynamical Systems 
This effort is aimed at automated analysis techniques for practically relevant problem classes. Our focus is on constructive formal methods for semialgebraic problems. This includes and extends many of the traditional system classes studied in traditional robust and nonlinear control theory.
Uncertain Dynamical Systems: This effort is aimed at understanding the extent to which automated analysis techniques can be applied to practically relevant problem classes. Our focus is on constructive formal methods for semialgebraic problems (those that can be modeled and formulated using polynomial equalities and inequalities in real variables), therefore including both continuous and discrete aspects. This is a surprisingly large class, including and extending many of the traditional system classes studied in traditional robust and nonlinear control theory.
