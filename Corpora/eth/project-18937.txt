  Risk Management of Financial Institutions  
The Basel II Accord fosters sophistication in risk management and makes capital requirements risk-sensitive. Using a systemic approach, we analyze to what extent the Basel II rules are suitable for reaching the goals of stability and efficiency. 
The Basel II Accord fosters sophistication in risk management and makes capital requirements risk-sensitive. Using a systemic approach, we analyze to what extent the Basel II rules are suitable for reaching the goals of stability and efficiency. In particular, we are concerned with the following issues: How does sophistication in risk management affect banking stability and market conditions? How does sophistication in risk management impact on the ability of banks to raise equity? How do risk-sensitive capital requirements affect banking stability? What types of risk-sensitive capital requirements minimize the risk of bank crises? Can hedging of loan portfolios via securitization lead to a more efficient allocation of macroeconomic risks? How should credit-portfolio-management tools account for the correlation effect, i.e., the fact that default correlations change in case of macroeconomic shocks?
