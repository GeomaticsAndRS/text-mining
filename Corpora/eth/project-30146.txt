  Unravelling Abiotic and Biotic Sources and Sinks of Carbon in Marine Hydrothermal Systems  
This is an organic geochemical and stable isotope study, addressing open questions on the production and consumption of dissolved organic carbon in marine hydrothermal systems and the links between inorganic reactions and microbial activity that that influence biogeochemical cycling of carbon.
