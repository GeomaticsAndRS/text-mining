  Pixel Detector for CMS  

For the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider LHC at CERN, a special custom-designed silicon pixel detector is being constructed in order to provide precise tracking information in a high track density environment. It is one of the crucial detector components for efficient detection and measurement of particles with long lifetimes, such as hadrons containing b- or c-quarks. The pixel detector consists of 60 million pixels with a size of 150umx100um each. The high granularity provides robust track finding. Analog readout and charge sharing between pixels give an expected hit resolution resolution of the order of 15um, which is essential for b-tagging. Each sensor pixel is connected to an electronic readout channel. A full custom ASIC that houses 4160 readout channels has been developed using radiation hard layout adequate for the LHC environment. The barrel part of the pixel detector consists of 800 rectangular modules that are mounted in three cylindrical layers. Each barrel module consist of a silicon sensor, 16 readout chips, a module controller and a high density interconnect.
