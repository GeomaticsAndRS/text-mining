  Vision at Work a fully computerized vision screening device enabling self-testing  
In order to cope with time constraints and with lack of reliability of data, a computerized method enabling self-testing of visual functions is developed by means of usability engineering methods. The system shall be used in occupational screenings, demonstrations, health campaigns etc. 
Summary of project: In order to cope with time constraints and with lack of reliability of data, a computerized method enabling self-testing of visual functions is developed by means of usability engineering methods. The system shall be used in occupational screenings, demonstrations, health campaigns etc. Work packages include, among others, optical and mechanical designs of screener components, movement analysis (testeeSs inputs), design of new tests for visual functions, interaction software, validation. The project is supported by the Swiss insurance company suva. Keywords: Vision screening, occupational health, vision at work, usability engineering, optics, psychophysics, pointing
