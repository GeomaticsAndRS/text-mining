  Chromatin Remodeling Factors  
Nucleosomes are not typically static entities fixed along genomic DNA, but are capable of sliding along DNA, affecting the accessibility of regulatory sites and genecoding regions. We are also pursuing cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography of these factors bound to nucleosomes. 
Nucleosomes are not typically static entities fixed along genomic DNA, but are capable of sliding along DNA, affecting the accessibility of regulatory sites and gene-coding regions. Although mobility is a property intrinsic to nucleosomes, the rate of translocation is evidently too slow to accommodate most processes in the nucleus. Energy-dependent, multiprotein complexes called chromatin remodeling factors have been discovered that enhance the mobility of nucleosomes, possibly transiently changing their structure. We have prepared milligram quantities of the yeast Isw1a, Isw1b and Isw2 chromatin-remodeling assemblies via expression in insect cells [1]. We are studying nucleosome binding, chromatin modification mechanisms, and complex structure [2, 3]. We are also pursuing cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography of these factors bound to nucleosomes.
