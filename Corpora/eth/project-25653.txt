  Control of metal-catalyzed stereoselective hydrogenation by supported ionic liquid  
The main target of our research is to develop a rational basis for the design of supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysts for stereoselective hydrogenation reactions. This goal will be pursued using a combined catalytic and physicochemical  approach.
