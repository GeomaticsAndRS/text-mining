  Scaffold-free cell delivery for use in regenerative medicine 
The development of cell-based therapies for diseased tissues is one of the most promising research directions in regenerative medicine.

The development of cell-based therapies for diseased tissues is one of the most promising research directions in regenerative medicine. Cell-delivery methods are an essential part of cell therapy concepts. Therapies with the potential to become clinical routine will only be possible if these methods ensure efficient engraftment and therapeutically-relevant number of cells survive. Here we provide an overview of three different scaffold-free cell-delivery concepts: (i) single cell delivery, (ii) cell sheet engineering and (iii) microtissue technology.
