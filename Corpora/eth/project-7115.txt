  Simulations of Global Climate and Climate Change with General Circulation Models  

In a joint project with the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology (MPI), Hamburg, simulations of the global climate with the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM are performed at the Swiss center for scientific computing, CSCS, Manno. The simulations are conducted with unprecedented high horizontal resolution at global scales (1.1\dg), a resolution previously restriced to numerical weather prediciton models with short integration periods. The emphasis is on simulations for present-day conditions and climate change scenarios with increased levels of CO2 concentration. The analysis of present climate simulations allows an estimate of the model accuracy and identifies weaknesses in the model parameterizations as guideline for further model improvement. The focus is on the radiation budget, on the surface hydrology and snow characteristics, and on the boundary layer structure. Furthermore the blocking performance of the model is evaluated. High resolution climate change experiments with doubled CO2 concentration are used to study possible changes in the mass balance of the polar ice sheets and associated sea-level rise, and changes in the earth's raditation budget and in the surface hydrology. Regional changes with focus on the Alpine areas are assessed in the framework of the EU project SIDDACLICH.
