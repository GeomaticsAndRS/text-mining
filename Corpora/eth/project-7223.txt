  Space Diversity and Beam Forming with Interference Suppression for the UTRA Uplink with WCDMA  

 For the UTRA uplink with WCDMA, two different joint demodulation schemes with iterative interference cancellation (IC), namely Space Diversity (SD/IC) and Direction of Arrival (DOA/IC) schemes, are derived in the framework of the aforementioned SAGE algorithm. Both smart antenna algorithms rely on a common channel model and maximize the underlying log-likelihood function iteratively w.r.t. the channel parameters to be estimated and the data bits to be detected. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are estimated independently at each sensor in the SD/IC using a standard parametric channel model while discrete impinging waves described by delays, DOAs and complex amplitudes are estimated by the DOA/IC scheme. If a potential model order mismatch, i.e. a number of impinging waves differing from the hypothesized number for the receiver design, is included in the analysis, the SD/IC turns out to be more robust than the DOA/IC in terms of the achievable bit-error rates. In channels with discrete isolated waves both schemes perform similarly. In particular, the SD/IC operating without antenna calibration as opposed to the DOA/IC shows a higher robustness in different environments, has a lower complexity and is thus more attractive for a practical implementation.
