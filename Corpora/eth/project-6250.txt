  Optimising operations for Final Settling Tanks  

Transport processes in Final Settling Tanks (FST) are decisive to predict the operation of  the entire activated sludge system and finally the quality of the effluent. The recycled sludge between FST and the reactor, the sludge constitution and the sludge transport system are the main parameters for the sludge management in a FST. The goal of the actual study is to optimise the sludge transport system for different stresses of the FST. By physical and numerical modelling, parameters of the sludge transport system, like scraper height, scraper velocity, distance between two scrapers and mainly the scraping direction will be varied. A first run of physical investigation is realised with over a 100 tests at a constant sludge constitution. The subsequent analysis of the investigated data will lead to different correlations of various parameters and give the base to important criterions for an optimised FST operation.
