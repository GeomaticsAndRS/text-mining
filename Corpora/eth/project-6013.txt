  Initiation Sites for Pitting Corrosion - Macroelectrochemistry and Microelectrochemistry  

 The initiation sites of the localized corrosion of metallic materials protected by a thin passive film are structural, compositional or mechanical inhomogeneities of the substrate, generally in the sub-micrometer range, depending on the purity of the metals and its surface roughness. The aim of this project was to identify those initiation sites, where metastable pits can grow to stable pitting corrosion. With the computer assisted transient technique (macroelectrochemical technique) the initiation phase of pitting can be studied very precisely in the time domain. The influence of composition of the base material (mostly stainless steels), of the aggressive environment and the applied potential can be studied and evaluated statistically. An electrochemical set-up with a current resolution limit in the fA range and the use of an electrochemical microcells (microelectrochemical technique) allowed investigations of sample areas in the micrometer range. In this way not only potential pit initiation sites (inclusions, grain boundaries, precipitations, etc.) can be studied but also the electro-chemical background noise is markedly reduced. Therefore processes in the nanometer range can be detected. To understand the mechanism of local corrosion attacks, the electrochemical behavior of different initiation sites have been studied. Measurements showed that the pitting potential (characteristic value for the resistance against pitting) is increased by decreasing the sample surface - i.e. by decreasing the number of weak sites. The study of the dissolution of single manganese sulfide inclusions showed that these inclusions play a major role as potential weak sites. To understand the mechanisms of pitting combined micro and macro investigations is usually necessary to provide the relevant information.
