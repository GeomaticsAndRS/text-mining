  Obesity related inflammation, hepcidin and iron absorption  
Iron status is often decreased in obesity. Subclinical inflammation in obesity may result in increased hepcidin concentrations, thus reducing iron absorption. Iron absorption studies using stable isotopes in obese subjects before and after weight loss will help understand the underlying mechanisms.
