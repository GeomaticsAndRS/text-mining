  Auto Fix  
Large amounts of legacy software need to be updated to the modern world ­ the object-oriented world. This project examines automatic and heuristic techniques for inferring abstractions in non-O-O software, for example programs written in C. It aims at full object-oriented results with contracts. 
Our previous work has resulted in automatic mechanisms for testing software, "programs that test themselves". This project is the next step: after a failure, identify possible fixes and apply the right one.
