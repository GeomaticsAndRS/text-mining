  Ion-Selective Electrodes (ISE) in Clinical Laboratories 

 Electrolytes were analyzed in heparinized blood plasma samples from 82 volunteers. The volunteers included healthy individuals as well as hospitalized patients undergoing hemodialysis or suffering from cardiologic failure. Total concentrations were determined using a Hitachi 747 automated analysis system (indirect measurement) and the active molality using an AVL 988 and AVL 985-S analyzer (direct measurement). The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of changing mass concentration of water, ionic strength, single-ion activity coefficients and degree of complexation on interpretation of raw-data. These parameters may lead to differences between results obtained from direct and indirect measurements. The IFCC (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry) recommends an algorithm in order to transform results from direct ISE methods into total substance concentrations. We found that, when this algorithm was applied to the results of direct ISE sodium- and potassium-analysis, errors of more than 0.5 % occured in 17 % of the samples studied. These errors were mainly due to individual variations in the mass concentration of water, which is not taken into consideration in this algorithm. We concluded that the transformation procedure performed frequently using this algorithm is not only dangerous with regard to possible misinterpretations, but may also lead to the loss of important information included in the sensor raw-signal. Additional information can be gained by comparing direct and indirect electrolyte measurements so as to estimate the mass concentration of water. In addition, the extent of error in ISE results brought about by liquid junction potential variations was determined. It was shown that errors due to the influence of the liquid junction potential in ISE applications can be minimized by mathematical correction or by special calibration procedures.
