  Group actions on finite dimensional contractible spaces  

Kropholler introduced the class of HF-groups: it is the smallest class of groups containing  all finite groups, such that G belongs to HF if there exists a finite dimensional contractible G-CW-complex with all stabilizers in HF. The class HF contains almost all known groups but, nevertheless, many interesting cohomological facts on groups can be proven in an inductive way, once one knows that a group belongs to HF. Of particular interest is the case of group actions with finite stabilizers. It is almost possible to characterize in a purely algebraic way discrete groups acting properly on finite dimensional contractible spaces.
