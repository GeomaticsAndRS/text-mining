  Accelerated Creep and Progressive Rock Slope Failure 
In this project we study the physical processes behind precursory signals of catastrophic rock slope failures in crystalline rocks. The most important precursory signal studied in this project is accelerated slip recorded over 10 years at high spatial resolution at the Preonzo (Switzerland) rockslid
