  Shedding light on dark matter 
Three projects to probe the nature of dark matter (DM): (i) using stellar dynamics and strong gravitational lensing to directly image DM; (ii) using Galactic survey data to measure the local DM distribution; and (iii) combining these with computer simulations to test different DM models.
