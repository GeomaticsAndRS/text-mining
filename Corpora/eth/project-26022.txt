  Molecular mechanisms underlying adult neurogenesis  
We aim to understand the mechanisms underlying tadult neurogenesis, utilizing in vitro characterization of neural stem cells and manipulation of endogenous neural stem cells within the adult brain using modern transgenesis- and virus-based tools.
