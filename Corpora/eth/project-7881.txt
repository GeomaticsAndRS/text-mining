  Wavelength Division Multiplexers in InP/InGaAsP  

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is becoming increasingly important in fiber optical  links. All-optical WDM systems are very attractive since they can fully exploit the almost unlimited bandwidth of the optical fiber. N high bitrate signals at different wavelength can be sent over one single access fiber using NxN multiplexers. Such a system has can offer cost effective broadband services to each subscriber. Various WDM concepts can be interpreted as integrated prism. We realized different WDM filters: arrayed waveguide demultiplexers (PHASAR) and reflective grating type demultiplexers. Phasar wavelength division multiplexers with multi-mode interference coupler (MMI) can be more compact than conventional phased-arrays with free-space couplers (FSC) and have a potentially lower loss. Multiplexers using FSCs allow the use of a high number of array waveguides and so they can have a better sidemode suppression ratio.
