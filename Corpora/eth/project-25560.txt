   Building Costs Building Type U  
This study tries to identify correlations between housing typology and production costs. The findings on the key factors and parameters involved in the costs of residential housing can be used to create the basis for a longer-term ongoing collation of data on residential  construction projects
Rationale In recent years the dynamic in Swiss residential construction has shifted considerably: whereas just a few years ago row houses (Reihenhaus) and blocks with apartments leading off an external corridor (Laubengang) were widespread, now the dominant style of new housing is apartment blocks with three or more units per floor (Mehrspänner) grouped around a common access point. Building costs' the intention is to examine in what way the In this study on 'Building type U typology of residential construction impacts on costs. Taking the example of 6-8 completed row housing projects and multi-apartment buildings respectively, information will be collected, analysed and compared on both production costs and project-specific factors regarding morphology, volumes, space programme, parking, apartment types, structural system, schedules and project organisation. Key weighting will be given to the question of whether and according to which principles a meaningful comparison can be drawn between the profiles drawn up in this way. By contrasting individual parameters, the aim is to arrive at a differentiated assessment which will also allow conclusions to be drawn about the applicability of commonly accepted parameters. Objectives The objective of the study is to identify the correlations between housing typology and production costs. In addition, the findings on the key factors and parameters involved in the costs of residential housing can then be used to create the basis for a longer-term ongoing collation of data on residential construction projects.
