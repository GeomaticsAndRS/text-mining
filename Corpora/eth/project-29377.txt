Enabling advanced functionalities of Diamond and other ultra-hard materials by Integrated Pulsed Laser Ablation Technologies.
Diamond and other ultra-hard materials possess outstanding mechanical, wear and thermal properties that make them attractive to manufacture a wide range of high value-added products such as high-performance, smart tools. However, due to the extreme properties of this group of materials, efficient and precise generation of complex 3D freeform geometries and structures to meet the needs for a further development of high-performance tools is still a challenge. DIPLAT addresses the need for an efficient, precise and flexible processing technology for ultra-hard materials in tooling applications, in order to fully exploit the potential of these materials. By smartly utilizing the advantages of high brilliance short and ultra-short pulsed lasers, a tooling technology based on 3D Pulsed Laser Ablation (PLA) will be developed and demonstrated for various industrial applications. DIPLAT will introduce new technology platform for producing ultra-hard tools with enhanced functionality, outstanding machining performance and superior lift-time.
