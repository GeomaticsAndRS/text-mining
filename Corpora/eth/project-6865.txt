  Synthesis and Evaluation of Pairing Properties of Novel DNA and RNA Analogues 

 Many oligonucleotide analogues have been prepared; they all maintain a systematic structural separation of backbone and nucleobase. Is this separation required for a successful pairing? To answer this question and to prepare novel autonomous paring systems, we have combined backbone and nucleobase. In a first type of analogues, we have linked C(8) of A via an ethynediyl group to C(5') of the next A unit and, similarly, C(6) of U to C(5') of the next U unit. We have developed the methods for synthesis of these analogues, and prepared dimers to hexamers. In a second series of compounds, we have connected a C(8)hydroxymethyl group of A via a phosphinato group to OC(3') of the next A unit and, similarly, a C(6)hydroxymethyl group of U to the next U group. We have synthesised singly modified random sequence 14mers and studied their pairing properties; incorporation lowers the melting temperature. This is not related to steric interactions with the C(5') group, as demonstrated by replacing the modified deoxyribosylnucleotide by the deoxyerythrose analogue. According to GROMOS calculations, the destabilisation is due to differences in conformation and solvation. Conformational analysis of a dimer showed that the anti-conformation, required for pairing, is not significantly populated. A third type of analogues has been designed. Here syn-conformers should pair. Experiments with partially protected dimers show that these indeed interact to form 1:1 complexes. The interactions and the synthesis of higher, unprotected oligomers are currently examined. For further information please see our homepage at: http://avws-indi2.ethz.chhttp://avws-indi2.ethz.ch\rh
