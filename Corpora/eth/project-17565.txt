The project Vision of Future Energy Networks (VoFEN) investigates various issues concerning future energy systems. The major difference to other research projects is a strong focus on multiple energy carrier systems and exploitable synergies. The motivation for this focus stems from the fact that more and more gas-fired power stations are being commissioned. Many of these both small and large scale power stations generate electricity and heat. Thus, a certain dependency and exchangeability between the electrical and the gas network is being established. Similar conversions between e.g. the electrical and the thermal network can be identified, resulting in various possibilities for interconnecting the electrical, chemical and thermal supply of loads. The increasing availability of decentralized generation technology (e.g. microturbines, fuel cells, adsorption coo due to the ongoing liberalization processes lers) as well as third-party network access regulations U results in a raising number of such interconnections. The project VoFEN applies a Greenfield U approach to investigate optimal network topologies and operation strategies. Only by neglecting existing supply infrastructures and by focusing on the load demands and available and foreseeable technologies, it is possible to identify potential topologies, showing in which direction todaySs networks and infrastructures should evolve.
