  ISOCYCLE: Tracing the carbon and water cycle in terrestrial ecosystems with stable isotope spectroscopy 
ISOCYCLE aims to improve our understanding of carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems and their response to environmental changes. We employ novel laser  spectrometers for stable isotopes and combine field observations with manipulative drought experiments and process-based modeling.
