  4-Channel InGaAs/InP Optoelectronic Integrated Receiver Arrays for 1.3-1.55 Fiberoptic Communication  

 As multi-gigabit optical transmission systems are reaching a practical application level, research on optoelectronic, integrated, InGaAs/InP based receivers, which can close the performance gap to hybrid circuits is stimulated. The principles for the design, the fabrication technology and performance evaluation of monolithic integrated preamplifiers operating in the multi-gigabit range are investigated in this project. Optoelectronic integrated receivers are projected to have the advantage of higher speed, improved sensitivity, smaller size and higher reliability compared with hybrid circuits. Our OEIC receiver array process is based on top-illuminated p-i-n photodiodes and junction fieldeffect transistors with non-uniform channel doping profiles. Integration is achieved in a MOVPE grown layer structure on a planar semi-insulating InP substrate. The work concentrated on the realization of multichannel receiver arrays for WDM applications. Within the ESPRIT III project MOSAIC (Monolithic and Hybrid Optoelectronic Smart Assembled Integrated Circuits) fully operational 4-channel receiver arrays operating at 2.5 Gb/s with a sensitivity of -27 dB
