  Transmitter-induced Neurotoxicity  

Brain damage in ischemic conditions and stroke is largely due to neurotoxic  cell death initiated by the excessive influx of Ca$^{2+}$ions into neurons. One of the major mediators of Ca$^{2+}$influx is the glutamate-gated NMDA-type receptor. Drug-induced blockade of this receptor can prevent cell death. Various NMDA-receptor subtypes are being identified immunobiochemically in order to define their role in pathological cell destruction. The project aims to define the receptors most suitable as targets for neuroprotective drugs.
