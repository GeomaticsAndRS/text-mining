  Attosecond imaging of chemical dynamics 
The interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with molecules generates attosecond pulses that convey detailed information on the electronic structure and dynamics  of the molecules. New methods will be developed to exploit this opportunity in a chemically relevent context.
Underlying attosecond science is the interaction between a molecule and a strong femtosecond laser field (10^14W/cm^2). The laser field removes one of the valence electrons by tunneling, accelerates it and drives it back to the parent ion which can result in recollision. The photorecombination of the returning electron generates extreme ultraviolet (XUV) attosecond pulses in a process known as high-harmonic generation (HHG). The emitted light can be used to image the molecular orbital involved in the process. These methods open new research directions that can address fundamental unresolved questions in chemistry and molecular physics. Here, we propose to exploit the ultrahigh time resolution offered by these techniques to investigate chemically relevant problems. Two classes of experiments are envisaged in the present proposal. High-harmonic generation can be used as a probe of molecular structure and dynamics on a femtosecond time scale. It can also be used as comprehensive method unifying pump (ionization) and probe (recombination) into a single laser cycle. The second approach is enhanced by correlation which offers exceptional temporal re~ solution (100-200 as). The specific questions addressed by the proposed research are the following: 1. What is the structure of molecular orbitals? Molecular orbitals can be imaged using highharmonic generation in aligned molecules. We propose to extend this method to more complex molecules. 2. How do orbitals change in the course of a chemical reaction? The evolution of molecular orbitals in the course of a photochemical reaction can be followed. This could eventually lead to an experimental verification of theories underlying chemical reactivity. 3. How does charge transfer occur and on which time scale? Tunnel ionization from a molecule launches an electronic wave packet that can be probed by the recombining electron in highharmonic generation with attosecond resolution. 4. Can light induce an electron current in a molecule and can one observe it using strong laser fields? Both questions have been answered positively by theoretical methods but no experimental evidence has been provided. We propose to address both questions in the present proposal. These four questions and the answers expected from the proposed research will provide insight into the structure and dynamics of molecules that will improve our understanding of photochemistry, molecular charge transport and light-controlled molecular electronics. Complications may arise from the effects of strong laser fields on the electronic dynamics of molecules that are presently under theoretical and experimental investigation. 1.
