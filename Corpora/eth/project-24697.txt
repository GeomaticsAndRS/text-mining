  Simulation of strongly correlated systems with tensor network algorithms 
We develop and apply tensor network algorithms (e.g. MPS, PEPS, MERA) for the efficient simulation of strongly correlated systems in one and two spatial dimensions.
The simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems (QMBS) is one of the biggest challenges in computational physics. The usually most powerful simulation method, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), fails for frustrated and fermionic systems due to the infamous negative sign problem, which implies an exponentially increasing computational cost with system size and inverse temperature. Thus, in order to study these systems accurately it is crucial to find alternatives to QMC. In recent years, new ideas from condensed matter physics and quantum information have led to a new class of methods for the simulation of QMBS, called tensor network algorithms. Tensor network states are efficient variational ansatz wave functions to represent ground states of local Hamiltonians, which typically obey the so-called area law of the entanglement entropy (with a multiplicative logarithmic correction in certain cases). A well known example is a matrix-product state (MPS), which is the tensor network underlying the famous density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to simulate (quasi) one dimensional systems. In recent years the MPS has been generalized to two dimensions, resulting in a so-called projected entangled-pair state (PEPS). Another tensor network is the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), which is particularly well suited to represent critical states in one dimension, and states in two dimensions obeying the area law. This project involves implementing, testing and further developing tensor network algorithms, as well as applying them to solve QMBS in one and two dimensions.
