  Numerical simulations of subcritical convection of Enceladus  
A hot temperature anomaly has been detected in the south polar terrains of Enceladus, icy satellite of Saturn. We show that only a non-Newtonian rheology can sustain a stable single-plume state at low Rayleigh number. Tidal heating makes the anomaly intense enough to match the detected heat flux.
The thermal dichotomy of Enceladus suggests an asymmetrical structure in its global heat transfer. So far, most of the models proposed that obtained such a distribution have prescribed an a priori asymmetry, i.e. a mechanical anomaly in the south polar ice shell. We present here the first set of numerical simulations of convection that yield a stable single-plume state for Enceladus without prescribed mechanical asymmetry. Using the convection code StagYY in a 2D-spherical annulus geometry, we show that a nonNewtonian rheology is sufficient to create a localized, single hot plume surrounded by a conductive ice mantle. We obtain a self-sustained state in which a region of small angular extent has a sufficiently low viscosity to allow convection to occur due to the stress-dependent part of the rheological law. We find that the single-plume state is very unlikely to remain stable if the rheology is Newtonian, confirming what has been found by previous studies. Additional simulations with tidal heating (see figure) show that the gravitational influence of Saturn increase the stability field of the single-plume state.
