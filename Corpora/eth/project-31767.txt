  MOUNTLAND 2: Prioritization for adaption to climate and socio-economic changes. Backcasting tolerable future states to match supply and demand for ecosystem services in mountainous areas.  
Ecosystem services provided by mountainous regions are strongly influenced by climate and land-use changes. This project identifies potential future tolerable states of ecosystem service provisioning and the impact of management and policy decisions towards achieving those goals.
