  2D, sheet-like polymers 

Development of amphiphilic monomers with D3h or D4h symmetry and three and four crosslinkable units, respectively, which can be spread at the air-water interface and subsequently be polymerized to furnish carpet or sheet-like polymers. These polymers should have a periodic covalent structure and a lateral dimension of up to the cm-range. They will be investigated for their properties.
