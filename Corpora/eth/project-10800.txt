  Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility of Single Crystal of Carbonate Minerals  
The magnetic anisotropies of carbonate minerals are being determined with a high-field torque magnetometer that allows separation of the susceptibility into a component due to these minerals and a component related to ferrimagnetic impurities.
