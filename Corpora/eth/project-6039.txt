  High Mountain Cartography  

Topographic high mountain cartography has a long tradition in Switzerland and other alpine countries. Therefore in 1996, the German Society of Cartography established a special "Working Group on High Mountain Cartography"(chairman: L. Hurni). It's aim is the promotion of cartographic methods for research in mountainous regions. It is obvious that high mountain cartography covers a broader range than just topographic cartography. This spectrum of themes and connections to related sciences has to be defined. In 1999 a new Commission on Mountain Cartography within the International Cartographic Association (ICA) has been established (chairman: L. Hurni). In the meantime the commission has organised five highly successful workshops on mountain cartography.
