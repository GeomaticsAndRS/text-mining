  Crystal Growth of Organic Single Crystals  

 We work on the crystal growth and morphology of new organic materials. Our current interest include hydrazone derivatives such as 4-Dimethylaminobenzal-dehyde-4-nitrophenyl- hydrazone (DANPH) and 3,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde-4-nitrophenyl hydrazone (3,4-DHNPH), co-crystals based on merocyanine dyes such as 4-(2-(1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-pyridylidene)-ethylidene)-cyclo-hexa-2,5-dien-1-one methyl 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate (Meero-MDB), and stilbazolium salts such as 4'-Dimethylamino-N-methyl-4-stilbazolium tosylate (DAST). All these materials are interesting new candidates for nonlinear optical and electro-optic applications. Our aim is the growth of large bulk size crystals with good optical quality as they are needed to measure nonlinear optical and electro-optic properties as well as to use them as optical devices.
