  Probehead design  

A new generation of probeheads for EPR spectroscopy is under development. Particular attention is given to high-frequency applications in the range 34-36 GHz and 90-100 GHz. At the same time in the lower frequency bands 2-4 GHz and 8-10 GHz we improve robustness, convenience to use and low temperature performance of resonators developed early. To minimize the development time, Microwave studio (CST GmbH), a CAD package for emf simulations, is used. (in collaboration with Dr. R. Schuhmann, Darmstadt)
