  Lattice Dynamics near the ferroelectric Instability in PbTe  
Recent experimental investigations have shown that PbTe and PbS are compounds which retain a high symmetry structure at all temperatures, while dipole formation would be expected at low temperature. A theoretical explanation of the phenomenon with first principles calculations is attempted 
Ferroelectric materials are characterized by a spontaneous local dipole formation below Curie temperature and a high symmetry structure above this temperature. In this regard two anomalous compounds have been found by recent experimental investigations, namely PbTe and PbS, which show a paraelectric phase at all temperatures while a ferroelectric ground state would be expected. A theoretical investigation of the phenomenon with first principles methods is currently under way. Several codes implement Density Functional Theory methods, the ones chosen for this project have been VASP and CP2K. Testing the performances of these two codes and setting up the calculations is the ongoing part of the project, the final aim is to run Molecular Dynamics simulations from first principles which will eventually shed some light on the structural properties of these compounds at finite temperature and explain the experimental results.
