  Synthesis of carbon black-supported silver catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO  
Different synthetic methods to prepare silver-based nanoparticle catalysts will be investigated, aiming to gain insights into the relationship between the synthesis, the resultant catalyst morphology, and the catalytic activity and selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.
Silver is known to catalyze the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO with relatively high current efficiencies (typically more than 80%), but this insight has been mostly derived from studies with polycrystalline metal electrodes. In contrast, the performance of supported silver nanoparticle catalysts, which would be more adequate for practical application, is relatively less well ° studied. In this project, we intend to compare the suitability of different proceduresUsuch as spray ° deposition, wet and dry impregnation, and traditional colloidal methodsUfor the synthesis of silver nanoparticle catalysts using conductive carbon blacks as support materials. This study aims to establish relationships between the resulting morphology of the catalysts and their activity towards the reduction of CO2 to CO, in the context of identifying new routes for the design of better electrocatalysts.
