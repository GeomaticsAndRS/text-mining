  Synthesis of carbon black-supported silver catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO  
Different synthetic methods to prepare silver-based nanoparticle catalysts will be investigated, aiming to gain insights into the relationship between the synthesis, the resultant catalyst morphology, and the catalytic activity and selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO.
