  Computational design and fabrication of deformable objects 
This project aims at developing novel physics-based algorithms to automatically design and fabricate custom deformable objects. 
The goal of this project is to propose novel algorithms to automatically design and fabricate custom deformable objects. In order to best match the designer's vision we combine the directability allowed by example-based approaches with the accuracy of physically-based methods. In an initial stage, mechanical properties of a set of base materials are captured and fitted thanks to a dedicated system. We then optimize for the system's available degrees of freedom in order to offload the tedious and iterative design process and parameter tuning to computer model. Eventually we validate our approach by fabricating a representative set of real objects designed with our method and comparing their deformed shape with the results predicted by the simulation.
