  Competition between two dominant grasses at different levels and ratios of nitrogen and phosphorus supply 

Nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometry affects species diversity-productivity relationships but through which competitive mechanisms is not fully clear. The aim of this study was to improve understanding why some plant species are able to dominate at N-limited conditions and others at P-limited conditons. We have investigated growth and plant traits of dominant species from N and P limited sites in relation to different ratios of N:P supply, when grown in monocultures and in mutual competition. We carried out an experiment with two grass species Agrostis capillaris and Alopecurus pratensis; the first species is able to dominate at P-limited conditions and the second at N-limited conditions (cf. Park Grass Experiments at Rothamsted). To be able to separate effects of N:P ratios and that of differences in overall nutrient supply we combined three ratios of N:P supply with three absolute levels of nutrient supply in a full factorial design (cf. previous experiments of Sabine Güsewell). To our knowledge such a competition experiment has not been carried before, but it might improve understanding and predicting vegetation alterations in relation to environmental change and eutrophication, including the loss of endangered species.
