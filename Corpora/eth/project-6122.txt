  Determination of High Precision Geoid  
GPS users working in cadastral and industrial surveying are working with two height systems: Orthometric heights in classical methods, and ellipsoidal heights in GPS. The projects amis at the determination of a highly accurate geoid for Switzerland thus providing the link between these two systems.
The need of high-precise geoids is obvious especially for GPS-levelling. In this project we work on a so called 'cm-geoid' for the area of Switzerland. The last efforts revealed an accuracy of the combined solution of the geoid of some 2 to 5 cm including rugged Alpine areas. The newly determined geoid is now in official use at the Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo)and provided to GPS manufacturers for implementation in geodetic dual frequency receivers thus allowing to determine orthometric heights in the field in real-time. Studies to reach a geoid accuracy at an unsurpassed accuracy level are presently under way at the CERN facility near Geneva. First results show that the requested accuracy of 10 microns at 200 m spacing (1 sigma level) are attainable. Further investigations were carried out in the Lower Engadine aiming at an inprovement of the Swiss geoid in this area of Switzerland. In a collaborative project between ETH and US National Geodetic Survey of NOAA, a geoid traverse has been measured using different methods. In this context 238 stations have been observed along a 330 long profile in Texas from Austin to Corpus Christi.
