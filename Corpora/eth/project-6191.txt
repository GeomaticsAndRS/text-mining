  BeAn - Dimensioning and Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Slabs  

This now finished research project combines the finite element method with the  theory of plasticity. The computational procedure comprises, besides optimal reinforcement dimensioning, the ultimate load analysis of reinforced concrete structures. Based on the lower bound theorem of plasticity, in order to determine the best possible arrangement of reinforcement, in addition to the stress state caused by external loading, fictitious self-equilibrating states are superimposed. The subsequent analysis shows the plastic rotational requirements for the given reinforcement and additionally provides the ultimate load level. This method can also be used to analyse existing reinforced concrete slabs as the used reinforcement contents are known.
