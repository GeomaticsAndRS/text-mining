  Effect of advanced 3D turbine airfoil and endwall contouring on the aerothermodynamics in the presence of realistic purge air flows  
The project addresses the impact of 3D blading and endwall contouring on aerodynamic performance and thermal loads under different purge flow conditions. A heat transfer platform will be integrated to the LEC facility LISA to measure thermal loads on endwalls and blades.
