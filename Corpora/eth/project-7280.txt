  Noise Measurement System using a New Measurement Method  

In the development of electronic devices and communication systems, the  specification and verification of appropriate noise performance is of prime importance. A new measurement method was developed allowing noise figure measurements at arbitrary source reflection coefficients. In order to define optimum measurement conditions for different applications, measurement accuracy and sensitivity was numerically investigated. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, an improved noise parameter calculation method was implemented in a commercial noise parameter measurement system. The new method enhances measurement accuracy considerably, especially when measuring modern devices with high input impedance. Furthermore, a noise parameter measurement system for the frequency range 0.5 to 6 GHz was built. Controlled by a PC, it is capable of measuring the noise parameters using several different methods.
