  Driving Behavior and Accidents in Horizontal Curves  

The most important perceptive elements of curves on rural highways are to be  identified from measurements of individual driving behavior while negotiating the curves. This data is analyzed and will provide guidelines on how to re-design curves on existing highways or to examine the traffic safety aspects of projects. At a number of curves the geometric details were measured, speed und lane behavior at several cross sections along the curve were monitored. This data allowed to track the individual vehicles negotiating the curve and to help detect possible geometric and optical deficiences relvant to the driver. The study aims at recommendations to be integrated in new highway design standards.
