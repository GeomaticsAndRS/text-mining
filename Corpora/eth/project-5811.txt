  Evaluation of Genetically Modified Food  

Food and food ingredients prepared with the aid of genetically modified organisms are reaching  the market. Our research interest is in the development of methods to evaluate the safety of such products. This includes conceptional work (e.g. definition of substantial equivalence) in international bodies (e.g. ILSI Europe) and experimental work to identify genetically modified organisms/products (e.g. by specific gene probes) and to prove their safety (e.g. by comparison on a molecular and organismic level with traditional products). The safety assessment of novel food in the sense of the European Union which also includes food prepared by new processing techniques, food with intentionally modified molecular structures, and single cell proteins, can be accomplished by equivalence and similarity targeting (SAFEST). Food is categorized into class 1) foods or food ingredients which are substantially equivalent to a traditional reference food or ingedient, class 2) foods or food ingredients which are sufficiently similar to a traditional reference food, and class 3) foods or food ingedients which are neither substantially equivalent nor sufficiently similar to a traditional reference food. The necessary nutritional informations are outlined. (D.A. Jonas, E. Antignac, J.-M. Antoine, H.-G. Classen, A. Huggett, I. Knudsen, J. Mahler, T. Ockhuizen, M. Smith, M. Teuber, R.
