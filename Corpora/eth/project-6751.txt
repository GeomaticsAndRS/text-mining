  Multidimensional Random Walk in Random Environment  

 The object of this long term project is to study multidimensional random walks in random environment. Random walks in random environment constitute one of the basic models of random motions in a random medium. Yet in dimension bigger than one, random walks in random environment are still poorly understood and represent a genuine mathematical challenge. This feature is due in part to the difficulty stemming from their strongly non-reversible character and traditional techniques of random media such as the "method of the environment viewed from the particle" have had so far little impact. An additional incentive to investigate the asymptotic behavior of random walks in random environment comes from the fact that the model is quite rich and fluctuations of the medium play an important role in the analysis, in particular due to the possible creation of traps. These traps for instance influence slowdowns of the walk.
