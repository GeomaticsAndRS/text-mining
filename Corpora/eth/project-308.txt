  Using a Geochemical Approach to Study Specific Biochemical Problems Associated with Microbial Dolomite Precipitation 
With the discovery of microbes that mediate dolomite formation, it is possible to conduct culture experiments in which dolomite is precipitated under earth surface conditions. This project uses this unique geomicrobiological tool to investigate long-standing geochemical questions involving dolomite.
