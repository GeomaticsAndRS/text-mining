  Low-Loss Polarization-Insensitive InP/InGaAsP Optical Space Switch Matrix for Optical CommunicationSystems  

 For practical application in optical fiber communication networks, single optical space switches have to be integrated into larger switch matrices. We designed and fabricated InP/InGaAsP optical space switch matrices by the integration of four 2x2 InP/InGaAsP Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches (as described before) and four input and four output tapered waveguides. We obtained fiber-to-fiber losses below 5 dB, low polarization sensitivity of only +/-0.5 dB in the on-state, and on-off ratios of over 15 dB throughout the 30 nm operational wavelength range around 1.55 \gmm. The low losses are obtained by the integration of the switches with optical mode converters and by careful optimization of the process technology. The low polarization dependence and high on-off ratios are achieved with a special orientation of the phase shifting waveguides relative to the cleaved facets and process-tolerant multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers.
