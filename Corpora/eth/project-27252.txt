  Kinetic parameter identification of large-scale metabolic pathways  
In this project, we are developing new method(s) to estimate a large number of kinetic parameters from metabolic time profiles. The new methods rely on decomposition of the estimation problem into subparts that are easy to solve, either by decoupling the ordinary differential equations or by .... 
Recent advances in biological techniques have permitted the simultaneous generation of large quantities of data characterizing metabolic systems, including time series concentrations of metabolites. The information about the underlying metabolic network in those data can be extracted by building kinetic models, which can later be used to guide metabolic engineering. However, the task of kinetic parameter identification remains to be the bottleneck in the inverse modeling of metabolic network from data. In this project, we are developing new method(s) to estimate a large number of kinetic parameters from metabolic time profiles. The new methods rely on decomposition of the estimation problem into subparts that are easy to solve, either by decoupling the ordinary differential equations or by performing the identification incrementally.
