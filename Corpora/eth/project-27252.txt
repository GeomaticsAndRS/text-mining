  Kinetic parameter identification of large-scale metabolic pathways  
In this project, we are developing new method(s) to estimate a large number of kinetic parameters from metabolic time profiles. The new methods rely on decomposition of the estimation problem into subparts that are easy to solve, either by decoupling the ordinary differential equations or by ....
