  Generating an Optimized CoMFA Model for N2 -phenylguanines as Inhibitorsof Herpes Simplex ThymidineKinase  

To better understand the effect of the different parameters in a Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) on the resulting predictivity power a set of N$_{2}$-phenylguanines as inhibitors of herpes simplex virus thymidine hinase is studied. A combination of different probe atom types, atomic charges and different potentials is used to describe the physico-chemical interaction energies within this pseudoreceptor approach. In addition direct thermodynamic binding properties of the ligand molecules to the enzyme are measured by isothermal microcalorimetry and fluorimetry in order to correlate enthalpic and entropic contributions separately with the corresponding calculated physico-chemical fields instead of using simply IC50 values.
