  Renovation of Old Buildings  

The ca. 200,000 historic buildings in Switzerland are situated in an area of conflict between market  values, regulations, preservation of monuments and sites and ecology. They are at once "consumer goods," legal objects, historical documents and resources. Their existence is based on the interplay of all of these elements. The task of old building renovation is to look at each of these interests separately, to analyse them and to find a synthesis. To this end, an apparatus with the following qualities will be developed: 1) It is practice-oriented; 2) It is suitable as a didactic aid; 3) It is based on three fundamental tasks: a) to record and evaluate the technical worth and quality of a building as a historic monument; b) to develop renovation goals that are friendly to old buildings; c) to translate ideas into optimal architectural measures. In the area of "Compression in Settlement Areas", a study on the theme of "Annexes" (additions, extensions, attic constructions, supplementary building) is in preparation.
