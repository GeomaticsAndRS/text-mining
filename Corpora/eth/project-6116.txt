  Characteristics of GPS Antenna and Multipath Effects  
Study the electrical characteristics of the antenna and investigate possible  sources, which affect the reception conditions, considering the physics of the atmosphere and the diffraction/reflection in the vicinity of the antenna (multipath effects).
