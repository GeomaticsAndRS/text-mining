  PVM Based SCIDDLE  

 In this project SCIDDLE, the tool for high-performance network computing that was developed in recent years at our Institute, is put on top of PVM. PVM is a de-facto standard as an environment for parallel applications based on the message passing programming model. Basing SCIDDLE on PVM will make possible the exploitation of the high-performing PVM implementations that numerous computer vendors provide. This is a joint project with with the authors of PVM.
