  Redundancy in Linear and Neuromuscular Systems  
Understanding and removing redundancy in a given data to improve computational efficiency or discover its fundamental structure is a universal problem in science and engineering, as the data or the mathematical model to be analyzed in any realistic situation often  contains redundant information.
Understanding and removing redundancy in a given data to improve computational efficiency or discover its fundamental structure is a universal problem in science and engineering, as the data or the mathematical model to be analyzed in any realistic situation often contains redundant information that is implied by the rest. This research project has two intertwined goals, one of them theoretical, the other one driven by a concrete application. On the theoretical level, we want to understand the structure of redundancy and the complexity of redundancy removal in explicitly or implicitly given linear and more abstract systems. Here we strongly build on our expertise in computational geometry as well as combinatorial optimization. On the application side, we want to compute redundancy and assess the role of redundancy in neuromuscular control, a field that is trying to understand how the nervous system is selecting and implementing specific muscle commands that meet the constraints of specific tasks. This part of the project will be performed in close collaboration with Francisco Valero-Cuevas. He pioneered in modelling the interplay of various muscles in terms of zonotopes whose internal structure determines the possible tasks that the muscles under consideration can achieve together.
