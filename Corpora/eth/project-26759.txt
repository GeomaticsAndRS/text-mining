  The role of protein-impurity interaction and protein conformation in the context of protein purification 
The chromatographic purification of recombinant proteins can be impro-  ved by understanding the effect of the impurities and the protein conformation on the adsorption and transport properties of proteins
Understanding the interactions between proteins and process related impurities is crucial for the development of downstream processes for recombinant proteins. The separation of strong interacting and/or co-purifying impurities from the product of interest is a particularly challenging task for the release of new therapeutic proteins into the market. By gaining fundamental knowledge on how the adsorption and transport properties of proteins are affected by conformational changes of the protein and the presence of impurities, purification processes can be improved. This research project studies on the one hand the impact of protein-impurity interaction on the purification process, particularly between E.coli derived proteins and endotoxins and monoclonal antibodies and host cell proteins. On the other hand, the conformational stability and aggregation behavior in the presence of denaturant agents and other additives for purification is investigated.
