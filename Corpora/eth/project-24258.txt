  Muon Spin Rotation studies of quantum magnetic materials  
MuSR spectroscopy is used to study magnetic ordering and spin glass  behavior in quntum magnetic materials where correlations are typically suppressed by enhanced zero-point quantum fluctuations.
Muon spin relaxation has been extensively used to study various magnetic materials [1]. Muons get implanted on interstitial sites in the sample. Therefore they are local probes and provide information of their magnetic surroundings. They are an especially powerful tool to detect weak magnetism. Experiments can also be performed above the ordering temperature to study magnetic fluctuation. Therefore Muons provides unique information on organic anti- and ferromagnets [2,3], spin gap systems [4] and spin-1/2 chains [5]. The aim of this project is to use Muon spin relaxation to study different quantum magnetic materials. In particular, we investigate S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with random bond strength. Theoretical calculations predicted a new magnetic groundstate called random singlet state in such chains. At the moment our focus is on the compounds BaCu(Si1-xGex)O7 and Cu(py)2(Cl1xBrx)2. Recently NMR found hints of a random induced ground state in BaCu(Si0.5Ge0.5)2O7 [6]. We will prove if we find such a ground state by MuSR and other techniques in this 2 compounds. We will also continue to study the 3D ordering of these materials to compare the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment with theoretical predictions [7]. Another part of this project is to study spin ladders by MuSR. In systems exhibiting a spin gap, quantum phase transitions between gapped and gapless phases can be driven by an external magnetic field. The organic compound (2,3-dimethylpyridinium)2CuBr4 is a realization of a rare strong rail 1D quantum spin ladder. Specific heat has shown that (2,3 DmpyH)2CuBr4 undergoes a transition to a Luttinger Liquid above 0.3 K and above a critical field of 2.8 T [8]. At lower temperatures it forms a Bose Einstein Condensate. We plan to study different phase transitions by MuSR. This has never been done due to the lack of suitable spin ladder compounds and spectrometers. Blundell S. J., arXiv:cond-mat/0207699v1. Blundell S. J. et al., Physica B 289 115 (2000). Le L.
