  Cocultures with ARC Investigated by Video-time-lapse Microscopy  

A video-time-lapse microscopy facility has been set up in order to study  heterologous interactions in cocultures of ARC and fetal/neonatal cardiomyocytes as well as of ARC and skeletal muscle and non muscle cells. Concerning distribution and appearance of component proteins of intercalated discs during cell-cell interaction in vitro, distinct differences can be observed for the adherens junctions protein N-cadherin and for the gap-junction protein connexin 43. Expression and transport regulation is studied by several techniques; the extent of functional coupling is investigated. This will be important, if one considers the possibility of producing transplantable heart-tissue-like cell sheets, a possible means for transplantation into sites of defect myocard after heart infarction.
