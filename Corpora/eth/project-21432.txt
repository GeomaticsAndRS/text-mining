  Anticipating environmental impacts of scarce metals supply and their implications for emerging technology diffusion  
This collaboration project with EMPA aims at analyzing the dynamic interdependencies between primary and secondary supply of geochemically scarce metals, and the  corresponding demand for emerging technologies from a systemic perspective. The main focus is thereby laid on environmental impacts.
