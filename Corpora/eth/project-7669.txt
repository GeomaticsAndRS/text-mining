  Blood-Viscometry 

Based on a new method developed at our institute to measure the dynamiccharacteristic of an oscillatory system, we have been able to design aminiaturised system leading to a new type of blood  viscometer. This deviceallows the direct measurement of the viscosity as the blood is drawn fromthe vein. The viscometer consists of a thin tube, the resonator, which isconnectedon one side to the needle and on the other side to a vacuum container. Asthe blood is drawn from the vein through the needle into the tube, theviscosity can be measured within seconds without adding anticoagulants. Inthis manner the measurement of the blood viscosity can be performed verysimply as a part of the routine to collect samples for blood analysis.First clinical measurements have already been performed with the newdevice. Further investigations will show whether the data obtained areuseful for diagnostic purposes. With a novel technique, for which patentshave been applied for, the probe may be miniaturized substantially. Thusthe amount of fluid necessary to measure the viscosity can be reduced to afew micro-litres.
