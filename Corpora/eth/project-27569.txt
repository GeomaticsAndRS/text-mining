  Sustainability metrics and guidelines for the analysis of solvent-based post-combustion CO2-capture process alternatives 
This project is part of the collaborative EU-project (FP7) SCAPSOL: ¸ Design Technolo-gies for Multi-scale Innovation and Integration in Post-Combustion CO2 Capture: From Molecules to Unit Operations and Integrated PlantsT.
Sustainability is the concept of meeting your needs while maintaining the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It comprises economic, environmental and social aspects. Despite the development of several general indicator frameworks in literature, there is still a need to adjust these and/or develop new indicators on a case by case basis. The overall goal of this work is to develop a framework of sustainability indicators suitable for assessing the different solvents and process schemes for post combustion CO2 capture, focusing on the holistic environmental benefit for normal process operation through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach and substance/process Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) hazard identification for evaluation of the harm potential in accidental scenarios.
