  Solubility and Mobility of Small Particles in Polymers  

 The rational design of improved polymeric materials for membranes is only possible if the atomistic details of the underlying physical processes are known. Our approach to the theoretical treatment of the transport mechanisms of small guest molecules in polymeric matrices is based on statistical mechanics. This leads to an analytically tractable mathematical formulation of the solubility of small particles in a static matrix. The practical application of this theory to structures generated according to the amorphous-cell methodology yields quantitative predictions of the solubility of gases such as helium, methane and oxygen in polymers, as well as of their dependence on temperature and pressure. In the simulation of the diffusion of small molecules, the polymeric matrix is assumed to be rigid but animated by thermal vibrations. The guest particles diffuse through this static structure following a random walk constituted by many individual steps between energetically favorable locations in the matrix. The transition rates between such favorable loci are dictated by the interactions of the guest particle with its immediate environment in which the chemistry, i.e. the nature of the polymer macromolecule, plays a crucial role.
