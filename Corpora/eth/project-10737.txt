  Production and purification of recombinant cell wall lytic enzymes  
We investigate the use of phage-encoded cell wall lytic enzymes for various applications in vitro and in foods. The specific procedures are developed and optimized, for production of the recombinant enzymes in bacteria and the subsequent purification by IMAC chromatography.
