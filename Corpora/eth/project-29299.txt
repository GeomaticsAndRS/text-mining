  Preparation and application of CNTs/polyurethane conductive nanocomposites 
Conductive polymers have aroused extensive interest in research recently  The project is to study the preparation and applications of conducting composites derived from polyurethanes as host materia with conductive materials CNTs. The resulting conductive composites are useful in many fields.
