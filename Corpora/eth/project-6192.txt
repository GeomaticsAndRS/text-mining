  Simulation software of artificial ground freezing  

The planned special purpose software application simulates the growth of the  ice-body considering the flowing ground water due to artificial ground freezing. It expands the range of using the artificial ground freezing with more reliable prediction allowing a more precise planning. It will simplify project planning and help to avoid mistakes and their associated costs. The numerical simulation of the two coupled fields (temperature and ground water) will be done by the finite element method in a given three-dimensional region. Its development in time will be calculated considering convection caused by ground water flow and phase changing of water to ice and vice versa. The water pressure potential and the resulting flow of ground water is a function of both the permeability of the soil layers and the building of frozen soil. The material parameters, like heat conductivity, heat capacity, permeability, etc. are also considered.
