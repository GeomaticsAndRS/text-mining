  Mechanical characterization of human fetal membranes  
The project aims at caracterizing the mechanical behavior of fetal membranes in order to predict and avoid pre-term rupture. In collaboration with partners at USZ methods are developed for repair/sealing of ruptured membranes. 
~ mm thin bilayer that serves as barrier and The fetal membranes, chorion and amnion, form a 0.5 container throughout gestation. Mechanical rupture of membranes is part of the natural sequence of term delivery, but has serious complications when rupture occurs prior to term; spontaneous preterm premature rupture (sPPROM) before 37 weeks of gestation in the absence of labor affects 1-4% of pregnancies and accounts for 30-40% of preterm deliveries. In addition, introduction of needles or fetoscopes into the intrauterine cavity for diagnostic or operative purposes pose a significant risk for persisting membrane leakage and subsequent membrane failure (iatrogenic PPROM). Understanding the deformation and rupture behavior of fetal membranes and the structural response of the membrane bilayer is a necessary foundation for attempts to prevent or to repair PPROM. We perform uniaxial and biaxial experiments on fetal membranes in order to determine constitutive model parameters, and to examine their relation to molecular correlates for mechanical function, i.e. collagen and elastin, determined through biochemical analysis. Fracture mechanics experiments will be performed in the next phase to analyze the relationship between membrane microstructure and rupture properties.
