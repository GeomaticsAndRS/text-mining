  GMK Sphere / Medacta  
A comparative study on the in vivo kinematics and kinetics of the GMK Sphere in comparison to two conventional fixed bearing prostheses. 3D kinematics of the TKA by means of fluoroscopy, skin markers and ground reaction forces during level walking, stair descent and downhill walking are assessed.
