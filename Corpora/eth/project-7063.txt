  Determinants and Effects of Occupational Further Education  

In this project we first examine individual and structural  determinants of participation in further education after entry into the labor force among the two birth cohorts of 1949-51 and 1959-61 in the German-speaking region of Switzerland. The data for the analysis come from a survey conducted in 1989. This data source provides the first opportunity to examine further education trends in Switzerland. In the second step, we use event-history analysis to examine the effects of further education on horizontal and vertical mobility in occupation and income change. In addition, we also look at how further education affects job satisfaction. For women, we examine the issue of whether further education has any impact on their re-entry into the labor market and on the likelihood of moving out of female-dominated occupations. For both parts of the analyses, we examine cohort and gender differences.
