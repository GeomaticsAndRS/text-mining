  Data Re-Engineering  

Computer applications in industry are replaced periodically by successor  systems. During this process the migration of the user data from the old to the new system is a very important and crucial step in most applications. User data are often by far the most valuable part of computer applications. This research project focusses on the entire data migration process in large real life applications, including the transfer of data from ill-documented files into structured databases. Investigations concentrate on the systematic analysis of the old data (data reverse engineering) as well as on the forward engineering part with data conversion and data quality improvement methods. The goals of this project are a better understanding of the generic data migration process and the construction and application of an extensible toolkit to support this process.
