  The Remote Computing System  

 The Remote Computing System (RCS) provides an easy-to-use mechanism for exploiting computational resources in a network of heterogeneous computers. In order to minimize the response time, the execution of a requested service, e.g. solving a linear system, is dynamically allocated to an arbitrary machine in a given pool of computers. The execution time is estimated by means of algorithmic complexity and of network and machine load. Monitors (daemons) on each computer in the pool provide and periodically update the dynamic parameters. Because RCS is called asynchronously, it allows distributed applications with several solvers running concurrently on different computer platforms.
