  Increasing sintering resistance of supported platinum catalysts applied for alkane dehydrogenation  
Dehydrogenation of alkane is carried out at high temperature. The goal is to increase the sintering resistance of platinum particles supported on different materials by capturing the particles within a microporous silica layer. Extended lifetime and higher turnover are the  aims.
