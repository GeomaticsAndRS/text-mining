  InP HEMT Technology  

A reliable technology for fabricating integrated circuits, using  InP-HEMTs, has been established. The active HEMT layers are grown by commercial suppliers or collaborating institutes, but all processing steps are carried out in-house. One of the key steps is electron-beam lithography for defining the 0.2 \gmm gate. This is performed on an upgraded SEM which has the capability to carry out many of the functions of a professional system. The remaining processes are based on standard photo-lithography and wet chemical or reactive ion etching. The HEMT devices yield fT values of up to 170 GHz and fmax values over 200 GHz. Accurate models have been developed for the HEMTs and these have been used for circuit design. First designs have yielded state of the art single stage mm-wave amplifiers, oscillators and mixers as well as high performance transimpedance amplifiers for photoreceiver applications.
