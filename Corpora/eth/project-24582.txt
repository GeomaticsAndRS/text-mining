  Gene flow, virulence and evolutionary potential of the ash dieback pathogen Chalara fraxinea 
We study gene flow, virulence and evolutionary potential of the new ash dieback pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (anamorph: Chalara fraxinea) and its presumably non-pathogenic sister species Hymenoscyphus albidus.
