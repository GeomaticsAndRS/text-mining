  Assembly of macromolecular protein complexes: Type 1 pili from Escherichia coli as a model system  
Type 1 pili from pathogenic Escherichia coli strains are required for bacterial attachment to the surface of target cells. These highly oligomeric protein complexes are used  to understand catalyzed formation of macromolecular assemblies in vivo.
