  Ultra High Strength Aluminium Alloys  

High strength aluminium alloys are of major interest for weight saving  applications in aerospace technology as well as in light weight construction and transport. Research activities started in 1990 by evaluating the spray deposition process as a new technology for the production of ultra high strength aluminium alloys based on the age hardenable Al-Zn-Mg-Cu system. The microstructure, mechanical properties and stress corrosion behaviour of the alloys are extensively investigated. It has been shown that strength levels up to 770 MPa with good ductilities can be achieved in the peak aged condition. Furthermore, through an appropriate adjustment of chemical compositions to the spray deposition process and by optimizing heat treatments, a new class of high strength AlZnMgCu-alloys can be produced which show a very good compromise in strength, toughness, and stress corrosion cracking resistance. In combination of these three properties, the spray deposited alloys are superior to other high strength aluminium alloys. Ongoing research in close collaboration with industrial partners in Switzerland, Germany, and the USA will lead to further improved ultra high strength aluminium alloys as well as their production and fabrication into extrusions, forgings, drawn tubes and hydroformed parts on a commercial scale.
