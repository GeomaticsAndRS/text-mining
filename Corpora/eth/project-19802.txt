  Quantitative investigation of the Warburg effect and control of glucose metabolism in tumor cells by novel flux analysis and metabolomics  
Joint project between IMSB and Cell Biology, that aims at investigating the mechanisms governing the metabolic shift known as Warburg effect ubiquitously occurring in  tumor cells. The projects includes metabolomics and the development of novel methods for 13Cmetabolic flux analysis in higher cells
