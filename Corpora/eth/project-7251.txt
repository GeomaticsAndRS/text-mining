  Possy/TTS99: Polyglot speech synthesis in four languanges  

The aim of this project is the realization of a polyglot speech synthesis  system in four languages (German, French, Italian, and English). There exists already a large number of multilingual speech synthesis systems, which may produce speech for different languages but are in general not flexible enough to switch language within a single sentence. When switching languages it is usually necessary to change the application, because the underlying concepts and structures differ considerably as they are realized by different research groups. Moreover, each language is usually synthesized with a different voice. As opposed to multilingual synthesis, our polyglot synthesis should be able to synthesize four languages using the same voice and the same system, so that it will be possible to synthesize stretches of foreign languages within sentences of a different base language. Such a mixed-language or polyglot synthesis is necessary to synthesize, e.g., French or English proper names within a German utterance in applications such as a reverse telephone directory service for Switzerland.
