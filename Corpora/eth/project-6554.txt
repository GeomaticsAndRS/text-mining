  Research on the Dynamics of Development in Virgin Forests  

The objective of this project is to develop a better understanding of the natural  processes involved in the dynamic of forest ecosystems development at several space and time scales. For this purpose, long-term observations of forest structure and species composition are performed in unexploited (semi-)natural and oldgrowth forest reserves, on representative site types of Switzerland (partially since 1940). Location: 39 forest reserves.
