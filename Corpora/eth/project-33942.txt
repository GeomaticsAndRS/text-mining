  Synthesis of Macro-porous Materials for Separation Application  
The overall target of the project is to develop a scalable method for the production of optimized and versatile perfusive materials for chromatographic applications, able to achieve high throughput and tunable separation performances.
The focus of the project is the development and optimization of the production of macro-porous materials for separation application through reactive gelation. The presence of large pores enables a so called perfusive behavior in chromatographic application thus reaching flow-independent separation performances. By using a shear-induced aggregation step it is also possible to reach high productivities for the material of interest and through different functionalization high versatility in separation. The synthesis and complete structural description of different materials, i.e. by playing with the composition and/or the aggregation step, together with the performance assessment for biomolecules of different sizes and different functionalization are crucial to achieve an optimized and versatile materials for chromatographic application.
