  Photoabsorption, photoionization and photodissociation spectroscopy in the vacuum and extreme ultraviolet at high resolution 

A detailed investigation of the photochemistry and photophysics of gas phase atoms and molecules in the vacuum and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) region of the electromagnetic spectrum (wavelength < 200 nm) is of importance to understand photochemical processes in the upper layers of the earth atmosphere and in the interstellar medium. This project aims at measuring VUV and XUV photoabsorption, photodissociation and photoionization spectra of small molecules of interest for atmospheric chemistry and astrochemistry (e.g. N2 , O2 , H2 , H3 , CH4 , CO2 , ...) and to investigate, at high spectral resolution, how the atoms and molecules decay after absorption of VUV and XUV radiation. In particular, we are interested in obtaining information on the competition between photoionization and photodissociation and their dependence on the XUV frequency and on the quantum states of the excited molecules. Keywords: Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption spectroscopy, VUV photochemistry, VUV photophysics, high-resolution molecular spectroscopy.
