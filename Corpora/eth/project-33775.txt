  Energy efficiency information and renovation: Do professional consultants mitigate the enerfy efficiency Gap?  
Using revealed preference data we aim to analyse the determinants of energy efficiency home renovations in the period from 1996-2009 of approximately 1300 Swiss  homeowners with special focus on the effect of energy consultants on the probability to invest in energy efficiency.
Improving energy efficiency in the building sector can significantly reduce a country's total energy consumption as well as CO2-emissions. Investments in energy efficiency are important determinants to reduce the demand for energy in the building sector, to meet climate and environmental targets, and to lower dependence on fossil fuels. The overall energy efficiency of a building depends mainly on the insulation characteristics of the building envelope (façade, roof, windows and basement). Since renovation cycles are long, it is crucial to consider energy efficiency aspects when renovating a building today. However, it often seems that market failures, market barriers, bounded rationality and high transaction costs (e.g. search and information costs) inhibit investments in energy efficiency.
