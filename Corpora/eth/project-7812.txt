  Magnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems and Related Compounds  

Our ongoing research on magnetic and superconducting properties of so  called heavy fermion and related compounds includes at present the following systems: U$_{2}$_{17}$, U$_{14}$_{51}$, UNi$_{2}$_{3}$, U(Pt$_{1-x}$_{x}$)3, CeB$_{6}$, CeAl$_{2}$and others. Objectives are the interplay of magnetism and superconducivity, elucidation of Doniach's phase diagram, small moment magnetism and short range as well as long range ordering phenomena.
