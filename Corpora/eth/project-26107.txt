  Identification of novel targets and drug candidates against multi-drug resistant bacteria  
This project approaches the increasing problem of multi-resistant, pathogenic bacterial strains with a novel and unique intervention strategy. Follwoing a top-down approach, newly identified potential transcriptional resistant regulators from clinical isolates will be integrated into our ....
