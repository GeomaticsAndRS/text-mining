  Extensional Flow-Induced Structural Changes in Emulsions  

Knowledge of the rheological properties of emulsions, can be used to help predict their flow behaviour during transport and processing. Due to the flow conditions imposed, however, emulsions may undergo structural changes, such as droplet deformation, coalescence, and break up. Many factors affect the properties of emulsions including continuous and dispersed phase properties and proportions, type and concentration of surfactants and stabilisers, emulsion age, and flow history. The aim of this project is to understand the effects of a defined laminar or turbulent flow field on an emulsion, expanding on studies of single drop systems with known interfacial and rheological properties. Current work focuses on characterising emulsion behaviour during extensional flow, as well as examining the effect of an extensional flow field on emulsion structure. While the rheology of emulsions and foams in shear flow has been extensively studied, little experimental work has looked at the extensional properties of emulsions. In this study uni- and biaxial extensional flows are generated in an opposing jet flow device. Structural changes of the treated emulsions are measured by laser light diffraction and microscopic techniques. Such experiments will aid in the optimisation of emulsifying processes and products, as well as in the development of mathematical models of the structure-building processes in emulsion systems.
