  Cross-disciplinary workplace intervention strategy for recurrent musculoskeletal disorders 
Work-related back pain is the main reason for absence of work in Switzerland. This project investigated the feasability of a multi-center randomized controled clinical  intervention study to test an innovative cross-disciplinary intervention strategy based on company absence managment systems.
Aim: It was attempted to study the effects of an interdisciplinary return-to-work program simultaneously fulfilling given local conditions and scientific criteria of a randomized controlled trial. Procedures: The program consisted of a work hardening program and workplace intervention. Results: We expected 4.5 cases per 1000 person-years. But recruitment proved to be extremely difficult, so that we finally worked together with 18 companies, representing approximately 110S000 employees. Within a study period of 48 months 82 cases were followed during one year. 55 cases fully adhered to the study protocol. The multidisciplinary intervention significantly improved physical capacity, but this effect was mostly due to the results from the Zurich clinic. Absence data from companies were biased and could not be used for analysis. Conclusions: Recruitment through companies was difficult and strongly influenced the course of the research. Labor market and company structure continuously changed and influenced motivation to participate in the randomized controlled trial. An accurate randomization was achievable but the low number of reached patients severely hampers to draw general conclusions for the many cases that must have occurred within the study population but could not be reached by the research team. The final report was sent to SUVA and will be discussed in January 2013. A paper will be submitted within 2013.
