  Finite Element Simulation of the Face  
Through a detailed anatomy and a realistic constitutive modeling of facial soft tissues this project aims at enhancing the understanding of the biomechanics of the face and at providing information for surgery planning. 
Through a detailed anatomy and a realistic constitutive modeling of facial soft tissues this project aims at enhancing the understanding of the biomechanics of the face and at providing information for surgery planning. A full 3-D FEM of the face has been reconstructed from MRI scans of a human face. Particular attention has been taken towards the identification and realistic modeling of the relevant anatomical structures. Mechanical properties of soft tissues were selected according to previous works or based on reasonable assumptions. Due to the large scatter of data proposed in the literature for skeletal muscles, parametric studies were carried out in order to quantify the influence of constitutive model parameters of muscles. A first validation has been given to the model through the comparison of simulations with 3-D data obtained with MRI and holography techniques. In order to acquire more experimental data for the determination of constitutive model parameters for facial tissues (in particular skin and SMAS), an instrument to perform relaxation tests on the face has been developed and measurements with the aspiration device will be performed. Local measurements included application of the Cutometer and the aspiration device. Modeling of active muscle behavior and wrnkle formation is considered.
