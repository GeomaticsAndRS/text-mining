  Focused Ultrasound-mediated delivery of encapsulated MGMT antagonists for the treatment of temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma 
The aim of this research project is to develop a new approach to overcome MGMT-mediated resistance which severely limits the efficacy of temozolomide in the majority of glioblastoma patients.
