  N and P cycling within soil aggregate fractions in maize-pigeonpea intercropping systems of Malawi  
This project will compare crop production, soil fertility accumulation, and N and P nutrient cycling within soil aggregates between maize-pigeon pea intercrops and sole cropped maize in order to elucidate the mechanisms involved with nutrient transfer between pigeon pea and maize.
