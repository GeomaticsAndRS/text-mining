  Optimal Material Choice by Experimental Thermo-Mechanical Analysis  

The choice of an optimal material combination for structures withthermo-mechanical shock loads  is more complex than for conventionlly loadedstructures. There are many important failure mechanisms and, therefore,experiments are necessary to evaluate an optimal material. In cooperationwith w+f Bern a material test with the help of a Nd:YAG-laser has beendeveloped. This material test has been designed to:* simulate repetitive thermo-mechanical shock loads;* determine the influence of changes in the micro-structure of the materialon the macroscopic mechanical properties;* evaluate the fatigue behaviour of metals and ceramics under repetitivethermo-mechanical shocks;* evaluate an optimal material combination for a specified load history.Currently, the Nd:YAG-laser material test is beeing cross-checked with awell known material. The first results are very encouraging and show a goodcorrespondance between test results and practical experience.
