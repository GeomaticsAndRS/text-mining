  Real-time Digital Flow Visualization  

In practical applications such as aerodynamic testing there exists an interestin fast, quantitative flow visualization.While whole-field techniques like PIVcan provide large measurement datasets in near real-time, the informationtends to be too low-level for a rapidinterpretation. What is needed is ameans of on-line data interpretation, forexample the extraction of the flow'stopological features. The project at IFDaims at providing such an analysis tool,based on the image-based measurement of various quantities (pressures,velocities, streamlines etc.). The resultswill be superimposed in real-time ontothe model's image, thus providing an"enhanced reality"view. Some of thealgorithms used in the visualization ofCFD results can be used although it isexpected that the main processingstrategy will be based on imaging andmachine vision techniques.
