  The MUSE 2nd generation VLT instrument 
MUSE is a proposed 2nd generation instrument for the 8-M VLT that will  be an integral field spectrograph of unprecedented sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution and spectral coverage, enabling a wide domain of scientific investigations.
MUSE is a proposed 2nd generation instrument for the 8-M VLT that will be an integral field spectrograph of unprecedented sensitivity, spatial and spectral resolution and spectral coverage, enabling a wide domain of scientific investigations. The instrument consists of 24 identical 2dimensional spectrographs fed by image slicer units to yield high resolution R=3000 spectra at 0.2 arcsec sampling over a full 1x1 arcmin2 field of view. It is proposed that ETH provide the complete optical components for this novel instrument.
