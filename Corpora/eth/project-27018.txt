  In situ infrared monitoring of the solid/liquid catalyst interface during the three-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over nanosized Au on TiO2  
The three-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene catalyzed by nanosized gold over titania was investigated in a slurry. Simultaneous in situ ATR-FTIR monitoring of the  liq. phase and at the solid/liq. catalyst interface identified the species adsorbed on the catalyst and those in the liq. phase during
The three-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene catalyzed by nanosized gold over titania was in Simultaneous in situ ATR-FTIR monitoring of the liq. phase and at the vestigated in a slurry. a solid/liq. catalyst interface identified the species adsorbed on the catalyst and those in the liq. Nitrosobenzene was not detected anal. while the spectroscopic meaphase during the reaction. a surements strongly indicated phenylhydroxylamine as an intermediate reacting before desorbing Under the same reaction conditions, azobenzene and hydrazobenzefrom the catalyst surface. a When ne were identified as intermediates during the hydrogenation of azoxybenzene to aniline. a nitrosobenzene or phenylhydroxylamine was alternately fed as reactant, azoxybenzene was pro With the former, azoxybenzene was not further reduced by duced via a disproportionation route. a Combined with H2 uptake, the spechydrogen because nitrosobenzene deactivated the catalyst. a troscopic measurements provided new insights into the reaction mechanism of the gold catalyzed hydrogenation of nitrobenzene and an update of the corresponding kinetics.
