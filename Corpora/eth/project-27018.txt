  In situ infrared monitoring of the solid/liquid catalyst interface during the three-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene over nanosized Au on TiO2  
The three-phase hydrogenation of nitrobenzene catalyzed by nanosized gold over titania was investigated in a slurry. Simultaneous in situ ATR-FTIR monitoring of the  liq. phase and at the solid/liq. catalyst interface identified the species adsorbed on the catalyst and those in the liq. phase during
