  Database of Zeolite Structures on the Internet 

A set of searchable databases covering various aspects of zeolite structures has been set up on the internet at http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/\rh on behalf of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association for the benefit of the zeolite community. The databases include information on zeolite framework types (including live 3d models), typical powder diffraction patterns of zeolitic materials (generated online according to the users preferences), selected references on zeolite structures, systematic descriptions of disordered zeolite structures, and schemes for building models of the zeolite frameworks. New framework types are added as soon as they are approved by the members of the Structure Commission (an IUPAC body). Efforts are underway to expand the literature database and to increase the number of materials with full crystallographic data.
