  Process-Viscometry  

At our institute we have developed a method and designed a system tomeasure the dynamic cha-  racteristics of an oscillatory system. Applying thismethod, we can determine the resonance frequencies with an accuracy as lowas 10-6 (for example 0.1 Hz at 100 kHz) and damping with an accuracy of10-3. This technology can be used in a variety of oscillatory systems, inparticular in mechanical resonator-sensors, and is already in industrialuse in process-viscometry.A new device for the on-line measurement of the viscosity of a fluid hasbeen developed at the Institute of Mechanics and patented world-wide. Theviscosity is determined by measuring the damping of an oscillator which isin contact with the fluid. The probe, f.ex. a rod vibrating in a torsionalmode is immersed in a fluid. The motion of the surface of the probeproduces a boundary layer in the fluid and increases the damping of theoscillator. The damping is directly related to the frequency differencecorresponding to a given phase shift between the exciting force and thevelocity near the resonance frequency. To maintain the oscillator in itsresonance a phase-locked-loop control is used.Depending on the application the probe can be designed as a rod, tube ormembrane resonator. The main advantages of this device are the possibilityof fast on-line measurements and its insensitivity to vibratory noise fromthe environment.This technology can also be used to measure the density andthe complex viscosity of viscoelastic fluids.
