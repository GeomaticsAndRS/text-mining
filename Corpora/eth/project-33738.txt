Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been established as one of the major concepts for fluid animation in computer graphics. While SPH initially gained popularity for interactive freesurface scenarios, it has emerged to be a fully fledged technique for state-of-the-art fluid animation with versatile effects. Nowadays, complex scenes with millions of sampling points, one- and twoway coupled rigid and elastic solids, multiple phases and addi- tional features such as foam or air bubbles can be computed at reasonable expense. This state-of-the-art report summarizes SPH research within the graphics community.
