  Elliptic logarithms, diophantine approximation and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture  
Joint work with Vincent Bosser (Caen). We prove that the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for a single elliptic curve over number fields would imply a result in the direction of the abc-conjecture over number fields. The proof uses the elliptic analogue of Baker's method.
