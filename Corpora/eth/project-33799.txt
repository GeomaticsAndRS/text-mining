  Interactive Modeling and Animation of Realistic Digital Human Faces  
Modeling and animation of digital human faces have been major challenges for a diverse set of fields. In this project, we develop novel interactive tools, metaphors, algorithmic techniques, and representations for intuitive synthesis and modification of realistic facial models.
We aim at developing novel interactive tools, algorithmic methods, and representations for digital human faces. These methods will allow the users to synthesize realistic facial models and animations intuitively and efficiently. We build on and extend existing methods currently in use in research and industry. These include 3D facial model representations, animation tools and synthesis methods, facial detail synthesis techniques, and interactive interfaces. Novel methods for facial detail synthesis, and transfer of dynamic details for animations have been developed. We have a fully functional application geared towards professional artists. Future works will focus on advancing and consolidating the different techniques we have been developing to refine and extend our interactive interface.
