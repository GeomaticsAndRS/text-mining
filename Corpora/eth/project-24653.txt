  Sustainable platform molecules synthesis from sugar biomass feedstocks  
Due to the depletion of fossil fuels and pressure of the global environmental deterioration, there is a strong need to substitute the traditional fossil feedstock refinery to sustainable biorefinery utilising biomass feedstock, including lignocellulose, lipids, and proteins. 
Due to the depletion of fossil fuels and pressure of the global environmental deterioration, there is a strong need to substitute the traditional fossil feedstock refinery to sustainable biorefinery utilising biomass feedstock, including lignocellulose, lipids, and proteins. In this project, the biomass-derived sugar are the starting materials facilitated by green solvents and acidic heterogeneous catalysts to establish a continuous pathway for platform molecules synthesis which will be the building blocks for the biorefineries or for intermediates for biofuel production. The main targets in this project are 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, and -valerolactone.
