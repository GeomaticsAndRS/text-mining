  Support influence on the hydrogenation reaction of nitro benzene over Au/MeOx catalysts  
Gold catalyst shows interesting properties in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro compounds with high selectivity towards the nitro group in the presence of other reducible groups. Although there are many ideas about how the reaction proceeds over this catalyst  the actual reaction pathway ...
Gold catalyst shows interesting properties in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitro compounds with high selectivity towards the nitro group in the presence of other reducible groups. Although there are many ideas about how the reaction proceeds over this catalyst the actual reaction pathway is yet unknown. By varying the support we aim to find out to what extend each part of the catalyst is responsible for the features observed in this reaction and how to improve the performance of this catalytic system.
