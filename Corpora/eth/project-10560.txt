  Cognition and emotion in depression  
(Collaboration with Affective Disorders Unit Department of Psychiatry, University of Zurich and Department of Behavioral Neurology, Harvard University, Boston MA) Patients with major depression suffer from severe emotional and cognitive alterations will be investigated using fMRI and MR Spectroscopy 
Patients with major depression show often an expectancy bias; their emotional experience is biased by negative expectancy. We therefore investigated the influence of a preceding expectancy period on the neural correlates of emotional pictures using fMRI and neuropsychology. In a pilot study we investigated 14 healthy subjects in fMRI and neuropsychology (CANTAB). They viewed emotional pictures with and without preceding period of expectancy followed by a baseline while being scanned in fMRI. Preliminary analysis of results showed deactivation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), pre/subgenual anterior cingulate (PAC/SAC) and posterior cingulate (PC)in pictures with preceding expectancy while the right ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC, DLPFC) showed activation. In contrast, pictures without preceding expectancy show a converse pattern with activation in VMPFC, PAC/SAC and PC and deactivation in VLPFC and DLPFC. These results will be correlated with the test scores from the neuropsychological test battery. In addition, patients with major depression will be investigated with the same paradigm; based on prior findings it is expected that they will show abnormalities in the VMPFC, VLPFC and DLPFC during modulation of the neural correlates of emotional expectancy by a preceding expectancy. This might account for what clinically may be described the negative expectancy bias.
