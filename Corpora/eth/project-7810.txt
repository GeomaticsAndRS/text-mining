  Polarized Deuterium Target  

Spin-dependent electron scattering from polarized targets is relatively  new in electro-nuclear physics and is expected to produce important data for a better understanding of the structure of the nucleus and of the nucleons. For deuterium, the structure of the two-nucleon system is a central question in intermediate energy nuclear physics. For example measurement of the spin dependence of the (e,e'p) reaction for tensor polarized deuterium will give important information on new observables which are expected to be sensitive to the S-D structure of the two-body system. Furthermore, it is predicted that a precise measurement of the neutron charge form factor is possible through spin-dependent electron scattering of vector polarized deuterium. A comprehensive physics program of spin-dependent scattering from polarized internal gas targets is feasible because of the novel storage-cell technique. In December 1994 and January 1995 a data-taking run was carried out at the Internal Target Facility of the NIKHEF electron storage ring in Amsterdam with the tensor polarized deuterium target that was developed during the past three years by ETH and University of Wisconsin. For the first time, large asymmetries in the elastic and inelastic reactions were observed. A polarized atomic beam was injected into a teflon-coated 40 cm long/15 mm diameter/25 microns wall-thickness cell, cooled to 100 K by a He-coldhead, providing a target thickness of about 10$^{13}$atoms per cm-squared. With this experiment the feasability of spin-dependent electron scattering from polarized hydrogen/deuterium targets internal to an electron storage ring was demonstrated for both the elastic and inelastic channels. This and the installation in 1997 of a polarized electron source opens the door to a wide physics program with vector and tensor polarized hydrogen/deuterium internal targets.
