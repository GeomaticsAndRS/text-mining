  Development of Specific Gene Probes for Bifidobacteria and Their Use in the Selection of"Probiotic" Strains  

 In food fermentation technology bifidobacteria are added as living cells into milk products or supplied in animal food due to suggested probiotic functions. However, most of such industrially used strains are poorly characterized regarding origin, metabolism, viability in oxygenated food-environment, the suggested probiotic functions and the taxonomical position, respectively. The fate and a potential role of such bifidobacteria in the consumers intestinal tract have to be elucidated. As a first prerequisite for such studies, we developed a Bifidobacterium genus-specific nucleotide probe to achieve a clear identification and taxonomic position of industrially used bifidobacteria. Using this tool we are currently isolating intestinal bifidobacteria which survive in an oxygenated or acidic environment and finally we have to investigate probable enzymatic mechanisms and their genetic background responsible for such stress adaptation. In addition, the gene probes have offered an approach to screen for new Bifidobacterium strains and even new species as demonstrated by our detetection and definition of the new species Bifidobcterium lactis which we found in several fermented milk-products in some Europaen countries.
