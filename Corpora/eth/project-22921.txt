  Herbivore-vegetation interactions in tall grass savannas: exploring the limits for grazers to drive landscape dynamics 
This project is about the grazing activity of large herbivores in humid  tall-grass savanna, Tanzania. Grazing strategies of wildebeest and reedbuck are compared, and the influences of herbivores, fire and nutrients on vegetation composition and the dynamics of grazing lawns are studied.
