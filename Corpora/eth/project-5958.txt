  Chemical Investigation of the Cytotoxic Aqueous Fraction fromLeontice kiangnanensis  

 Leontice kiangnanensis (Berberidaceae) is mainly distributed in southeastern China. Its tubers are employed as a traditional remedy for the treatment of rheumatism and haemorrhage of gastric ulcer. Pharmacological studies showed that the both n-BuOH fraction and the aqueous phase after BuOH partition possessed anti-inflammatory effect on carrageenin-induced swelling of the ankle in rats and xylene-induced ear inflammation in mice, and cytotoxic activity against P388 lymphocytic leukemia in vitro. The most encouraging P388 activity (ED50=1.27 \gmg/ml) was located in the aqueous fluent from a styrene porous polymer gel column. Chemical investigation of this cytotoxic aqueous fraction revealed saponins and minor alkaloids. Ten saponins, four of which were suggested to be new compounds, were isolated from this fraction. Three out of the four proved to be bisdesmosidic octasaccharide glycosides bearing hederagenin, oleanolic acid and echinocystic acid as the aglycones, respectively, while the remaining was a tetraglycoside with a rare triterpene, caulophyllogenin, as the aglycone. Their structures were determined by a combination of chemical degradation and extensive NMR experiments including TOCSY, ROESY, HMQC and HMBC spectra. The purification of the minor alkaloids is in progress.
