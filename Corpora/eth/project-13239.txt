  EH-Myomesin Functions  
Myomesin is a M-band protein and is expressed in two splice isoforms. EH-myomesin is typical for fetal heart and for slow muscle. The fiber type distribution and the functions of EH-myomesin will be investigated with mutliple methods. The expression in diseased  hearts is a pathological marker.
