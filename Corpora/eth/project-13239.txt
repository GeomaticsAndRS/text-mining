  EH-Myomesin Functions  
Myomesin is a M-band protein and is expressed in two splice isoforms. EH-myomesin is typical for fetal heart and for slow muscle. The fiber type distribution and the functions of EH-myomesin will be investigated with mutliple methods. The expression in diseased  hearts is a pathological marker.
The function and structural incorporation of myomesin in the M-band of sarcomeres is investigated with immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, biophysical methods. Sections of different mulscle types is characterized by immunostaining. The interaction with other molecules of the sarcomere will be analyzed by yeast-2-hybrid analysis. The occurence of the molecule is analyzed by immunoblotting experiments. The molecular biomechanics will investigated by atomic force microscopy in collaboration with PD. Dr. M. Hegner (Basel) The molecular structure of the dimer of myomesin is beeing analyzed by Dr. N. Pinotsis, EMBL Heidelberg.
