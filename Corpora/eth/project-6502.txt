  Timber shortage in the 18th/19th Century  

The hypothesis of an alleged timber shortage in the 18th century and at the beginning of the  19th century is investigated. The fear of a timber shortage justified in that period many regulations by the authorities aiming at restricting timber exploitation by peasants and craftsmen and at increasing the timber production. The shortage thesis is considered from two angles: first by studying who was affected from it and how much, second by making clear the arguments. To this end the economical and social processes, which led to modern forestry, are investigated from an historical point of view. The eastern part of Switzerland between 1750 and 1850 was chosen as reference, since it entails urban and rural regions as well as Swiss-Plateau, Pre-Alps and Alps.
