  LifeLongJoints: Silicon Nitride Coatings for Improved Implant Function  
The LifeLongJoints network aims to develop and validate silicon nitride coatings for joint prosthesis applications. The combined high wear resistance of this material and solubility of any silicon nitride wear particles released reduce the overall potential for adverse tissue reactions.
