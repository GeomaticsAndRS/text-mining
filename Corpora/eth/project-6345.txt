  ergonomics technology - Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designing for Better Usability in Industry  

 A major problem for firms is the change from the traditional character based software (e.g. DOS) to today's standard graphical user interface (GUI). The goal of our work is to find a methodology to support the transition from one system to another, conserving the advantages of the old system such as learned stereotypes of behaviour and structure of the program (which in normal circumstances has been adjusted to users' needs over several versions); and sometimes hardware necessities (to maintain the clientele, the new program should be operable on the old hardware, or the underlying database structure should be used). Collaboration at an early stage, involvement of users, marketing and sales representatives, as well as from the development department are important points. Iterative design, with prototyping of archetypical sequences and situations, combined with user testing of sections of the program form a complete set of instruments which are used in projects. The usability lab is normally used for assessing the user-friendliness of the prototyping.
