  Post-tensioned timber structures  
The aim of the research project is the development of post-tensioned timber structures. As first step an innovative post-tensioned beam-column timber joint was developed  using glulam timber and local strengthening with hardwood in cooperation with the industrial partners Häring AG and Roth AG.
The aim of the research project is the development of post-tensioned timber structures. As a first step, an innovative post-tensioned beam-column timber joint was developed using glued-laminated timber and local strengthening of the joint with hardwood within the framework of the MasterSs Thesis of Roman Schneider (2010) in cooperation with the industrial partners Häring AG and Roth AG. The structural behaviour of the joint was studied in a preliminary test series. Further numerical investigations have been carried out. The use of unbonded post-tensioning and hardwood allows the design of beam-column timber joints with high stiffness and large rotational capacity. Further, the high level of prefabrication results in a cost-effective solution allowing very simple erection and quality control.
