  Man Machine Interaction - Interface Design: Emotions in HCI Affective Computing V MeasuringMood with Mouse and Keyboard  

 At present, computer systems force users to interact in ways that do not integrate the complexities of natural social interaction. Yet recent evidence demonstrates that humans have an inherent tendency to respond to computers in ways that are natural and social, mirroring ways humans respond to one another in social situations. A computer that could recognize emotional information expressed by the user and produce affective responses would appear significantly improved in its interactive capabilities. The central aim of this project is the development of a measurement method for reliable and valid automatic measurement of moods. In this context we need first to identify which affective human states a computer can interpret, and in which way. Psychomotor behaviour offers a new way to communicating human affective state to a computer. Traditionally facial expressions, gestures, and voice have been analysed in this context. Psychomotoric behaviour is a promising alternative because induced moods have been shown to affect the psychomotor behaviour. For instance, psychomotor retardation has been associated with sadness. Thus, behavioural factors related to the use of a computer system, such as the rate of mouse-clicks, typing behaviour and mouse movements may be variables reflecting peoples affective state. In this study we investigate the effects of five different mood states induced by means of film clips on the use of mouse and keyboard while performing a computer task. A number of indicators of the use of the computer system are determined through log-file analysis. These indicators are then correlated to the subjective affective reports of the subjects. Several physiological parameters are assessed as manipulation check.
