  Mapping athlete dynamics using coordinate-based techniques  
Speed, acceleration and actual path are crucial factors in many sports disciplines. We investigate methods to derive these parameters from measurements of low-cost and lightweight sensors, in particular GNSS, to visualize them and to relate them to images, videos and topography.
Speed, acceleration and actual path are crucial factors in many sports disciplines. Measuring these factors accurately and relating them to images, videos and topographic models is important particularly for training and performance analysis. Traditionally speed is determined based on timing cells and further information is often extracted from still images or videos. However, this requires significant effort for installation, maintenance and data processing and does not necessarily allow reconstructing athlete dynamics with sufficient coverage, spatial and temporal resolution. We investigate methods to derive these parameters from measurements of low-cost and lightweight sensors, in particular GNSS. Data processing software implemented in Matlab enables us to process raw GNSS data from highly kinematic applications with varying obstructions and reflections, as encountered e.g. in downhill skiing and other outdoor sports. Using a Kalman Filter, special noise models, advanced ambiguity fixing techniques and blending GNSS data with other measurements in a tightly coupled approach i.e. at the level of raw observations allows to achieve cm level accuracies for positions and mm/s level accuracies for velocities. The algorithms have recently been tested within a master thesis on a bobsled track and will next be combined with video-tracking.
