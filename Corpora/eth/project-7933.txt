  Surface Segregation in Random Binary Alloys  

This project is concerned with the theoretical prediction of the thermal  equilibrium composition at the surface of a random binary alloy from first principles. By combining the layer version of the multiple scattering KKR or of the TB-LMTO method with the mean field treatment of the configurational disorder embodied in the coherent potential approximation (CPA) we are able to selfconsistently compute the electronic structure and free energy for an arbitrary concentration profile perpendicular to the surface of the alloy at any temperature. In order to avoid a "brute force" determination of the optimum profile, we express the configurational energy as a series in powers of local concentration fluctuations around a chosen reference value, including all components of the energy functional in the expansion. The resulting effective Ising model can then be treated with the standard methods of statistical mechanics, and by iterating the procedure, the composition profile can be selfconsistently determined. We are presently investigating ways of including into the formalism the contribution to the energy due to the electronic relaxation following the interchange of two atoms of different type, ignored up to now. A further direction of research concerns the influence of surface ordering on the composition profile. Our results on the system Ni-10 at.% Al strongly suggest that the Al concentration in the (111) surface plane is locked at 25 % due to the formation of an ordered Ni$_{3}layer at high enough temperature.
