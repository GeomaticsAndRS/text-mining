  Industrial biocatalysis with new oxygenases in a novel electro-enzyme reactor. 

 The objective of this project is to obtain novel functional biocatalysts for regio- and stereoselective oxidation working in a 'reactor plugged to a wall socket'. A central part is the isolation of the responsible part of monooxygenases and the combination with an electrochemical regeneration system. Our aim is to use sophisticated mediator technology to develop biocatalysts which, in an industrial setting, are competitive to chemical catalysts used in hydroxylation. Together with an integration of mechanistic information of the enzyme and genetic engineering techniques, a large number of mutants prepared by directed evolution will be analysed by novel massive parallel screening methods. Based on the developments a basically new electro-enzymatic reactor will be constructed for chemical bulk synthesis of oxygenated fine chemicals.
