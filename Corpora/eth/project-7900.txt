  Structure and Functions of the Cerebellum  

With its billions of neurons the cerebellum is a major part of our  brain. Its regular anatomical structure is well understood and also the electrophysiology of its local networks, and functionally it is involved in motor control. In an international collaboration funded by the "Human Frontier Science Program" we are trying to characterize more quantitatively the computational power of the cerebellar network. Our group has built realistic computer models of the major neuronal elements, and in the next step we attempt to "program" the network in the context of well-understood tasks in the visuo-vestibulo-oculomotor control. We hope that by modeling the computational processes of such a network, which has been unchanged during millions of years of evolution, we shall grasp some fundamental principles of highly parallel distributed motor control systems.
