  Modeling of precipitation co-polymerization of acrylic acid and vinylpyrrolidone in organic solvent  
The precipitation co-polymerization of poly(acrylic acid-co-vinylpyrrolidone) in organic solvent is a promising alternative to the conventional process in solution. The elucidation of the main mechanisms regulating this system will allow the control of the particulate material properties.
When the reaction of poly(acrylic acid-co-vinylpyrrolidone), a water-soluble copolymer, is carried out in an organic solvent, polymer particles precipitate, thus forming a new, dispersed polymer-rich phase. The aim of this work is to combine experimental and modelling activities to elucidate the main mechanisms regulating the product quality of the precipitation co-polymerization of acrylic acid and vinylpyrrolidone in a mixture of ethyl acetate and cyclohexane. On the experimental side, the reactions are performed in well stirred, isothermal, glass reactor. Different operating parameters such as monomer mixture composition, monomer mixture holdup, initiator amount, stirring rate, presence of a third monomer and influence of the stabilizer, are considered. The product is characterized in terms of conversion, copolymer composition and particle size distribution. A comprehensive model of the system has been developed. Two reaction loci are accounted for, considering a conventional kinetic scheme of free radical polymerization in both phases. Notably, the diffusion of active chains from the continuous to the dispersed phase is accounted for. Finally, the model includes the population balance equations for active and dead polymer in order to describe the complete molecular weight distribution of the final product.
