  Regional differences of mass balance and their impact on the past and future evolution of glaciers in Switzerland 
Glacier mass-balance time series in seasonal temporal resolution for different glaciers in the Swiss Alps over the last 100-150 years are reconstructed based on accumulation and melt calculation using direct observations and volume changes in order to identify and interpret regional differences.
