  Flowability Improvement of Fine Powders in Atmospheric Discharge Plasma  
Surface modification of fine powders using atmosphercic discharge plasma with a precursor is investigated. The main goal of this project is to find suitable process conditions to reduce van-der-Waals forces between individual powder particles.
