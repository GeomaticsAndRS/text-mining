  3D tissue-engineered model of bone adaptation  
The project assumes that only through the setup of an in vitro co-culture it will be possible to mimic natural bone adaptation. Successful implementation of the project goals will allow studying the effects of different drugs in vitro in a de novo bone organ culture mimicking  human physiology.
For the development of advanced therapeutics, preventive or even cures of osteoporosis, there is a need to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of bone physiology. Screening and evaluation of drug effects in a reproducible controlled and dynamic 3D cell culture system facilitate the transferability of the results from pre-clinical to clinical stage and will be of high benefit for the pharmaceutical industry. This project aims at taking current approaches in bone tissue engineering one step further resulting in an in vitro model system that mimics normal bone turnover. The project works under the assumption that only through the setup of an in vitro co-culture that enables i) cellular crosstalk, ii) timely monitoring of growth and resorption of mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) and iii) the application of physiological mechanical stimulation it will be possible to mimic natural bone adaptation. Successful implementation of the project goals will allow studying the effects of different drugs in vitro in a de novo bone organ culture mimicking human physiology.
