  Discretization of generalized convection diffusion equations  
We study stationary and transient convection diffusion equations for differential form and their Lagrangian and Eulerian discretization by means of discrete differential  forms. The goal is to obtain structure preserving schemes for electromagnetic field equations in the presence of moving media.
The project is focused on discretizations of generalized convection diffusion equations of discrete differential forms. These provide models both for the classical convection diffusion equation -e*u+bu+yu=f as well as for the transport of magnetic fields in moving conducting fluids (magnetohydrodynamics). We pursue both semi-Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques, the former for the transient problem, the latter also for the stationary case. The challenge is robustness and optimal a priori error estimates in the case of vanishing diffusion e -> 0. In the project both semi-Lagrangian and DG-type Eulerian techniques could be extended to the generalized convection-diffusion problems for discrete differential forms. Exterior calculus involving the Lie derivative could be harnessed to achieve streamlined formulations. Sharper a priori convergence estimates beyond what was known before even for the scalar problem could be developed.
