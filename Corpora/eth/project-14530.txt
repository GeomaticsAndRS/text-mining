  Modelling of circadian cortisol secretion in humans based on large field studies  
Previous research reported flat circadian cortisol slopes in up to 10% of humans. Using multilevel modelling on data from three large field studies comprising more than 900 individuals with more than 25â€™000 samples over repeated days, we challange this view and provide alternative explanations.
