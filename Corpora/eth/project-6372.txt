  Process engineering: Biocatalytic production of chiral epoxides  

 Chiral epoxides are valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. The project is based on the application of living microbial cells as biocatalysts based on styrene monooxygenase (StyAB). StyAB is a soluble, two component flavin dependent monooxygenase. The enzyme has a broad substrate spectrum and catalyzes the epoxidation of aryl substituted vinyl groups in a highly enantiospecific manner. A recombinant whole cell biocatalyst based on E. coli JM101 expressing StyAB from Pseudomonas sp. VLB120 was developed. The cells are used in a two liquid phase emulsion bioreactor for the formation of different chiral epoxides with productivities of up to 4 g l-1 h-1 at high enantiomeric excess. The process includes in situ product recovery via extraction. Product purification is done straight forward by destillation. The process is covered by a patent and open to non exclusive use based on a license for industrial partners. The goals of this project are (i) to identify basic bottlenecks of two liquid phase biotransformations with respect to cell physiology, in situ product extraction, and productivity and (ii) to develop bioprocesses with maximum product concentration and volumetric productivity.
