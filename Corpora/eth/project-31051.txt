   Protein synthesis with the ketoacidUhydroxylamine (KAHA) amide-forming ligation  
We have developed a mechanistically unique approach to amide bond for the KAHA ligation. This amide-forming reaction operates in the presence of unprotected mation U functional groups preparing large molecules (mw >5000) and can be used for the chemical synthesis of proteins.
