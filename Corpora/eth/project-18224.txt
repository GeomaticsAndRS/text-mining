  Development of experimental and data analysis technologies for the identification of complex PTM-profiles  
Latest proteomics technologies including high resolution and high accuracy mass spectrometry in combination with sophisticated bioinformatics routines are applied to complex biological specimens with the aim to unravel post-translational protein modification profiles.
The dynamics and vast diversity of post-translational modifications (PTMs) pose an enormous challenge for the identification and positional mapping of the protein modifications. Combining latest proteomics technologies, in particular high accuracy and high resolution mass spectrometers, with sophisticated bioinformatics approaches, the project aims to characterize the complex PTM patterns of biological specimens.
