  Synthesis of (new) oxide materials and study of their physical and structural properties: Searching for new multiferroics and superconductors  
A new laboratory for the synthesis of special oxides was established in the period from 2011 to 2013. The materials which are considered, synthesized and studied are especially oxides of the type AnBnO3n+2 and hexagonal layered YMnO3 type compounds. 
A new laboratory for the synthesis of special oxides was established in the period from 2011 to 2013. The new lab allows the preparation of (new) oxide materials, especially in crystalline form via a solidification from the melt by using a mirror furnace. The principal motivation of this research is the search for new multiferroics and superconductors. The investigation of the physical and structural properties of the synthesized materials takes mainly place by using equipment in other divisions / in collaboration with scientists from other divisions. The materials which are considered, synthesized and studied are especially oxides of the type AnBnO3n+2 and hexagonal layered YMnO3 type compounds.
