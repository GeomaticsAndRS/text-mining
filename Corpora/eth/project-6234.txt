  International PIARC Experiment to Compare and Harmonize Texture and SkidResistance Measurements  

 With regard to update the current Swiss standards, the IVT participates at the international PIARC experiment to compare and harmonize texture and skid resistance measurements. Those measurements took place in 1992. The IVT used three devices: a pendulum tester, a skiddometer and a "Stuttgarter Reibungsmesser". The overall object of the experiment is to develop a formula for converting results produced by the different devices to an international friction rating and thus provide a basis for international standardization.
