  Engineering thermodynamically exact force fields 

 Classical molecular dynamics simulations have become an indispensable tool complementary to experiment in many areas of physics, chemistry and biology. However, their accuracy crucially depends on that of the employed force fields. In this project, we propose the introduction of a new class of force fields called generalized force fields (GFFs). A GFF is derived from a normal force field (NFF) for the considered system by introducing an additional dependence of the potentialenergy function on "collective" configurational coordinates, namely the NFF potential energy and the system volume. We also introduce a new class of "artificial" equations of motion, stretched-probability extended-ensemble dynamics (SPEED), enabling the sampling of pressure and temperature ranges (rather than points) in a single simulation. Using the additional flexibility afforded by these two innovations, we suggest an approach for the design of thermodynamically exact GFFs, i.e. force fields able to reproduce exactly the thermodynamic properties of the system over a selected range of pressures and temperatures. The key element of this approach is a matching of the density of states of the model to that of the real system, which can be extracted from the experimental pressure and volume dependences of the molar volume and energy. The reproduction of other (structural, transport and relaxation) observables is, however, not guaranteed and depends on the realism of the underlying NFF. In the initial stage of the project, this approach will be restricted to pure liquids, for which the GFF engineering method is presented in details. The possible extension to pure substances over their entire phase diagrams, to homogeneous liquid mixtures and, ultimately, to solutes in solutions is also discussed.
