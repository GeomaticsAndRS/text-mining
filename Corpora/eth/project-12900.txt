  Cell Division and Cytoarchitecture of Cardiomyocytes  
The heart is the first functional organ in the embryo. While embryonic cardiomyocytes still can divide, in the postnatal myocytes karyokinesis and cytokinesis are uncoupled and adult cardiomyocytes cease to divide. The mechanisms of this uncoupling is investigated in developing and diseased heart.
