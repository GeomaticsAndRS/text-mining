  Cell Division and Cytoarchitecture of Cardiomyocytes  
The heart is the first functional organ in the embryo. While embryonic cardiomyocytes still can divide, in the postnatal myocytes karyokinesis and cytokinesis are uncoupled and adult cardiomyocytes cease to divide. The mechanisms of this uncoupling is investigated in developing and diseased heart. 
Determination of the fate of the cytoskeleton including myofibrils of developing cardiomyocytes will be investigated by confocal microscopy and biochemical means like immunoblotting, in situ methods etc. Special attention will be given to timing of cytokinesis in cardiac development. Because cytokinesis and karyokinesis are separated in peri and early postnatal phases we will try to characterize if cytokinesis parameters are also expressed during induced cardiomyopathies. Induction may occur e.g. by genetic alterations or by adrenegic stimulation.
