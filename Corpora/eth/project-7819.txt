  Heavy Flavour Physics in e-p -collisions  

In electron proton collisions at the HERA collider, heavy flavours (charm and beauty) are copiously produced, predominantly through photon-gluon fusion processes. Charm and beauty production is detected through: - exclusive decay channels of D and B mesons; - inclusive decays with high pT leptons through semileptonic channels; - detection of lifetime signatures through impact parameters, decay lengths and secondary vertex distributions; - bound quarkonia states such as J/psi or Upsilon mesons; The aim is to study in detail the production mechanisms through measuring differential cross sections and comparing them with theoretical predictions, based on perturbative QCD. So far, the charm production is quite well described by the QCD calculations, while the beauty production is in general underestimated by theory. Further topics under investigation are: - determination of the parton contents in the proton; - fragmentation properties and their universality;
