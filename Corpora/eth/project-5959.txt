  Analysis of the Flavonoid Content of Chamaemelum nobile (Chamomillae romanae flos)  

 Roman chamomile is a widely used medicinal plant and as such Chamomillae romanae flos is a drug of the Ph. Helv. VII and Ph. Eur. Studies by other research groups have so far concentrated on the essential oil and the sesquiterpene lactone contents of this plant. There is little known about the flavonoid content, although flavonoids can be expected to be responsible for some of the pharmacological activity. Our studies therefore concentrate on the latter class of compounds. The flavonoids isolated from Ch. nobile can be devided into five groups: 1. methylated flavonoid aglycones, 2. hydroxylated flavonoid aglycones, 3. flavonoid glycosides with acyl groups, 4. flavonoid monoglycosides, 5. flavonoid diglycosides. Next to the flavonoids Roman chamomile also contains hydroxycinnamic acids, like chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid, caffeoyl glucose, dicaffeoyl glucose and feruloyl esters of fatty acids, which were identified. Methods for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flavonoids using HPLC in connection with photodiode array UV/VIS detection were developed. Plant material from different sources as well as seasonal variationes of the main flavonoids were examinated. These methods are also suitable for the quality and purity control of Chamomillae romanae flos.
