  Discovering the mechanisms regulating storage carbohydrate metabolism in plants and bacteria: implications for crop improvement and human health  
Starch is the major storage carbohydrate that accumulates in plants. Other a soluble glucan structurally organisms (bacteria, fungi, animals) store carbohydrate as glycogen U related to starch. Starch and glycogen are both phosphorylated, which is vital for their metabolism. However, this process is
