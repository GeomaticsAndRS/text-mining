  Mutational Receptor Analysis in vivo  

Neurotransmitter receptors in brain play a key role not only in regulating  physiological behavior but also in mediating complex drug responses. In the therapy of anxiety syndromes, insomnias and epilepsy, allosteric modulators of GABA$_{A}$-receptor function are of major therapeutic relevance. To assess which of the multiple GABA$_{A}$-receptors mediate the desired drug effects or the undesired side-effects, defined receptor subtypes are altered by gene targeting, making them responsive or unresponsive to a particular drug. This is accomplished by either disrupting the expression of a particular subunit or by exchanging single amino acids which are determinants for drug responses. Animals containing targeted receptor subtypes will be invaluable in helping to understand complex drug actions and in developing novel drugs to advance the therapy of anxiety disorders, insomnia and epilepsy.
