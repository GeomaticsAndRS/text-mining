  The Group LASSO  
In this project, we study the numerical and theoretical properties of a logit model with a LASSO penalty on the contributions for groups of variables. 
In some situations, the variables in a statistical model are naturally grouped, and one is interested in the relevance of the grouped variables and not so much in the individual variables. An example is a factor analysis model with qualitative measurements falling into one of k categories. In that case, the (k-1) dummies representing the k categories form such a natural grouping of the variables. In this project, we study the numerical and theoretical properties of a logit model with a LASSO penalty on the contributions for each group.
