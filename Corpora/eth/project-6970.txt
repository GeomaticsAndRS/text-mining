  Influence of social success feedback in a competitive task on testosterone reaction, peripheralphysiological parameters, and subsequent dominance behavior in humans  

Previous studies suggest an interaction between testosterone (T) and social-motivational parameters such as the claim for power and dominance. T-levels have shown to rise after effective control of a test situation or after success in sport contests. Recent research, however, suggest to reframe the appraisal of T action in social settings. These data support an association of T-levels to vitality, specific motives, patterns of action and thinking. It remains unknown whether short-term alterations of T-levels are related to changes in social interaction. With the proposed study we aim to elucidate the temporal relationship between T- and cortisol-levels and dominance behavior in a competitive discussion that is preceded by a randomly varied feedback on a performance test. Additionally recorded parameters include heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and electrodermal activity. Subjects participate in pairs in the experiment of 2 to 3 hrs duration. Subjects are matched according to baseline T-levels and exhibited dominance behavior in a preceding field study. Main Hypotheses: (1) A negative feedback to the performance test are associated with decreased salivary T-levels decrease and increased salivary C-levels, while the positive feedback condition shows is followed by a T-increase. (2) The extent of T change in response to the feedback explains a relevant proportion of the variance of the observed dominance behavior in the subsequent competitive discussion. (3) Subjects in the negative feedback-condition experience increased physiological stress (raise in heart rate, delayed return of blood pressure to baseline) as compared to subjects in the positive feedback condition.
