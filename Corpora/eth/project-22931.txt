  Rapid Prototyping For Structural Testing Of Discrete Structures  

This research project introduces 3D-printed structural models for exploring equilibrium (i.e. bendingfree) structures. It will further the fields of safety assessment of historic vaulted structures in unreinforced masonry, and design of novel, but efficient shells out of discrete elements. The project is developing a state-of-the-art testing laboratory at ETHZ for structural testing of complex assemblies of discrete elements using rapid prototyping and digital fabrication technologies
