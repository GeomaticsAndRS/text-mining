  Stability and aggregation behaviour of proteins under stagnant and shear conditions  
Aggregation of proteins is relevant to many human diseases and can be induced by various factors. This project is to investigate effect of electrolytes, pH, and particularly shear stress and interface state on the protein aggregation behavior.
This project includes two parts: (1) Protein aggregation and gelation under stagnant conditions. In our previous work we have found that in the case of aggregation of denatured BSA protein colloids, filamentous gels have been obtained at both extremely low and large CaCl2 concentrations, while particulate gels are formed at intermediate CaCl2 concentrations. We would like to investigate and understand if such observed phenomena are specific to BSA or general for different proteins. (2) Protein stability and aggregation under shear conditions. During their production and purification, biomedicines such as antibodies face shear stress, which may induce unfolding and aggregation of the proteins, particularly when the contacting surface is hydrophobic. In this project, we design and use well defined flow devices with specific surface properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity) to investigate the interplay among the flow specifics, surface state and electrolyte type and concentration in destabilizing the proteins. Moreover, since food protein clusters are potential devices for drug delivery, in this project we also produce food protein clusters in flow and investigate the effect of different flow conditions on the structure of the protein clusters.
