  Petrology and physical properties of partially molten silicic magmas in subvolcanic magma reservoirs: A combined experimental and field study 
The experimental study is targeted to quantify physical, rheologic and thermochemical properties of partially molten, crystal-rich, intermediate to felsic, hydrous magmas under shallow crustal conditions.
