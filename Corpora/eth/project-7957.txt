  Mouse model to study the virulence function of the Salmonella SPI-1 Type III secretion system  
We have stablished that streptomycin pre-treated mice offer a unique infection model which allows for the first time to use mutants of both Salmonella typhimurium and the host (mice) to study the molecular mechanisms of enteric salmonellosis.
