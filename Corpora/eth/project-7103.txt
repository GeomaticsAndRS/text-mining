  Microbial Productivity in a Littoral Stand of the Emeregent Macrophyte, australis  

 Quantification of microbial secondary production is thought to be a key component in the analysis of nutrient cycling and energy flow in ecosystems, but apart from pelagic systems, information on microbial production is virtually lacking. This is especially true for macrophyte-dominated littoral zones of lakes and other types of wetlands. This project aims at determining, for the first time, the production of both fungi and bacteria associated with the aerobic submerged compartments of an aquatic reed stand (Phragmites australis). The considered compartments comprise coarse-particulate benthic organic matter (CBOM), sediments, epiphytic biofilms, and the littoral water column. Samples are taken at monthly intervals in Lake Hallwil, a eutrophic lake of the Swiss Plateau. Fungal production is determined with the $^{14}-acetate-to-ergosterol technique and bacterial production is estimated with the $^{3}-leucine method. Microbial biomass is also determined by either the ergosterol method (fungi) or by epifluorescence microsocpy (SYBR Green as the bacterial stain) coupled with an interactive image analysis system. Concomittantly, amounts of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are determined in the four compartments above. Preliminary results suggest that carbon fluxes through bacterial and fungal assemblages are an outstandingly important component of biogeochemical cycles within reed beds.
