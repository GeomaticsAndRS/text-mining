  ETH House of Natural Resources  
A pilot building (ETH House of Natural Resources) has been designed using two innovative structural systems, a post-tensioned timber frame and a composite beech  LVL concrete floor. The research project focuses on the full scale tests on-site and the structural system identification via monitoring.
In timber research, a main objective is the development and promotion of innovative and efficient timber structures. Therefore a pilot building, named ETH House of Natural Resources, has been designed, which uses two innovative structural systems, a post-tensioned timber frame and a composite beech LVL concrete floor. The building will be used as an office building for the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology from ETH Zürich and will serve as a showcase building of a sustainable and reliable timber construction for students and researchers, among others. The building has multiple innovative aspects, such as the use of beech for structural elements, the implementation of a permanent sensor network, and the performance of in situ tests at different construction stages.
