  ETH House of Natural Resources  
A pilot building (ETH House of Natural Resources) has been designed using two innovative structural systems, a post-tensioned timber frame and a composite beech  LVL concrete floor. The research project focuses on the full scale tests on-site and the structural system identification via monitoring.
