  NCCR Digital Fabrication - Robust distributed control of construction robotics in an uncertain environment  

Robots assisting humans on a construction site must be capable of accomplishing control tasks in an uncertain environment and in cooperation with both human workers and other robots. The work environment contains significant uncertainty: uncertain robot dynamics; poorly known loads and contact forces; a changing environment; imprecise knowledge about the robotSs position as well as those of the humans or robots assisting it in a task. Managing the coordination in this environment is a significant challenge, requiring sophisticated analysis and design methods as well as control computation advances for implementation. Solving these problems will greatly enhance the ability of multi-robot systems to blend into their environment safely and to perform and adapt to a given construction task collaboratively while minimizing ecological or economic objectives.
