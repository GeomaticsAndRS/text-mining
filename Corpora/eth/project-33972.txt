  Genomic imprinting in wild tomatoes: transcriptomics of hybrid seed failure and evolution under contrasting mating systems 
We study the molecular correlates of hybrid seed failure, an important  postzygotic barrier in wild tomatoes and other plants, by deep sequencing of transcriptomes of endosperm tissue from "normal" and failing hybrid seeds. Of particular interest are imprinted genes and their expression in hybrids.
