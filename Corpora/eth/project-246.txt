  Experimental Investigation of Bubbly Jets 
A variety of measurement techniques, including double optical probes, hot-wire anemometry and PIV are used. Of particular interest are the large structures in the jets. The experiments are conducted with monodisperse bubbly flows and variable bubble size.
