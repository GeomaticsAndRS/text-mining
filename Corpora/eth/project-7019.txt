  Human Rights in Swiss Foreign Policy: Conceptual Changes and Their Implementation  

 Swiss human rights policy, foreign economic policy, and development policy were separate policy areas for a long time. In particular, the observance of human rights was no criterion for the initiation of economic relations and for the allocation of development assistance. In the 1980s, however, human rights gained importance in Swiss foreign policy. Subsequently, human rights issues began to enter other policy areas, especially the field of development cooperation. With the end of the Cold War it became the general rule in international relations to link economic assistance to political conditions. Since the 1990s, Switzerland too has explicitly bound its economic assistance to political criteria, especially to the fulfillment of human rights. This linkage-policy represents a conceptual reorientation in Swiss foreign policy. A first aim of the project is to analyze these conceptual changes that led to the inclusion of human rights aims into other political areas, in particular into foreign economic policy and development cooperation. A second part of the project examines the implementation of this policy. The second aim of the dissertation is thus to investigate whether and to what degree human rights do matter in Swiss foreign policy.
