  Elastic properties of hydrous phases in the deep mantle: A high-pressure ultrasonic interferometer study  
This aims to measure the bulk sound velocities for hydrous silicates, namely clinohumite and phase A at high pressure and temperature. Velocities of polycrystalline aggregates are done with the multi-anvil ultra-high pressure device and the newly acquired ultrasonic measurement equipment.
