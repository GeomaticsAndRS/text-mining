  Characterization of Genes Involved in Growth Control in Drosophila  
Growth is controlled by genetic factors. Tumor formation is the result of a breakdown of the genetic control of cell growth. To elucidate the genetic basis of growth control we will characterize 4 novel growth regulatory loci that have been isolated in a genetic screen for growth mutations.
