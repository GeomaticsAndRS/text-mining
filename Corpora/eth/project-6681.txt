  Lognormal Distribution  

 The normal or Gaussian law is by far the most widely used distribution in both theoretical and applied statistics. Nevertheless, when studying natural phenomena in many fields of science, measurements are usually fit better by a lognormal distribution. While professional statisticians are used to transforming such data to the log scale and then proceding by the methods based on the normal law, practitioners often use these techniques on the original data and are mislead to draw inadequate conclusions. In a paper published in Bioscience (Vol. 51, No. 5, May 2001, pp. 341352), we discuss ways to describe and treat lognormal data adequately in terms that are readily interpreted. We are still interested in collecting experience with applications of the lognormal distribution.
