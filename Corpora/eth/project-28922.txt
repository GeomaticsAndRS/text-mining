  Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from paddy farming by intercropping with other economically useful plants 
This project explores the potential for developing new rice based cropping system integrated with novel strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We are  testing aquatic plant species for their potential to reduce emissions of methane and nitrous oxide while grown together with rice.
