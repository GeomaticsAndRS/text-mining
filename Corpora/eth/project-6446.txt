  Phosphate and Crop Productivity  

This project is a multidisciplinary approach to genetically modify the phosphate (Pi) efficiency  of plants in order to optimise sink-source interactions and hence crop yield and quality. The project falls within the metabolism and gene expression section of area 3 in the "1994-1998 Biotechnology Workprogram" of the European Community. Our work includes the isolation of genes involved in Pi acquisition and subsequent molecular and biochemical characterization of the encoded products, such as Pi transporters and regulatory proteins thereof. Here we make use of appropriate yeast mutants and the yeast complementation system (Daram et al., 1998). A second approach aims at the generation of transgenic potato plants exhibiting an increased capacitiy to hydrolyse organically bound Pi in the rhizosphere. This should result in improved crop plant varieties which are better adapted to Pi poor soils.
