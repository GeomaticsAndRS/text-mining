  Nonlinear optical and electro-optical properties of molecular crystals  
In this project we study novel classes and functionalities of organic nonlinear optical materials and their potential for active photonics devices and THz wave generation.
Nonlinear optical materials enable light (photons) to process information in a manner analogous to electronics, which forms the basis of one of the most rapidly developing fields in science and technology today, photonics. The importance of optical technologies for telecommunication, presently based on inorganic materials, is steadily increasing due to the high transmission bandwidths offered by optical signals. Organic nonlinear optical materials present a class of functional materials with large and extremely fast nonlinearities compared to their inorganic alternatives. These materials additionally offer a wide variety of design possibilities and characteristics, also due to the complexity of their nonlinear optical response, which is still not very well understood. Our investigations in this field include molecular engineering of new organic systems, bulk and thin film single-crystalline growth, investigations of new structuring processes for organic solids, and studies of the newly developed materials with respect to their linear optical, electro-optical, nonlinear optical properties, micro-structure characteristics and generation of THz waves. Our experimental results are analyzed and compared with different model calculations to obtain a better theoretical understanding of the nonlinear optical processes of organic nonlinear optical molecules, crystals and polymer systems.
