  Occupational Health - Dynamic Content Management for Web-Based Learning  

 The aim of this project is the development, implementation and operation of a Dynamic Learning Content Management System (DLCMS), which allows the reuse of learning objects. The Virtual Learning project (VIL) of the post graduate studies Work and Health shall be used to exemplify this. The lastest development of web based learning systems are Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS). This requires a paradigm shift for those who design instruction. They will have to take on a mindset of creating learning objects for reuse. The vision is to enable new and existing learning content to be created as small independent learning objects. The Dynamic Learning Content Management System manages the learning objects in a repository and meets the following requirements: ease of use, support of evolving didactics, pedagogically adequate structuring, flexible visual design, possibility of various learning paths, future-proof technology.
