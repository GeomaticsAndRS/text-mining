  Swiss Participation in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) 

 Having no direct access to an ocean, Swiss membership in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP), which is sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation, provides Swiss earth scientists with a means to pursue state-of-the-art marine research on an international level. IODP is a new program, which began on 1 October 2003, and offers the possiblity to conduct science-driven drilling projects using a multi-platform approach. Switzerland has joined with 15 other European nations to form the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling, which performs as a single partener within IODP. Swiss participation in an international ocean-floor research program is crucial for keeping abreast of the latest information on marine research.
