This project concerns research themes that interlink four domains in mathematics: combinatorics, algebra, geometry and optimization. We address fundamental questions and applications that rely crucially on this fusion. Our strong drive for this fusion of the established research domains comes from the observation that several fundamental problems spreading over these domains are closely interlinked: a solution to one of the problems often leads to a solution for another one in a different domain. More precisely, we propose to study the following four specific research themes (with its principal domain). I. Classifications of Oriented Matroids (Combinatorics) II. State Polytopes of Polynomial Ideals (Algebra) III. Minkowski Addition of Polytopes and Convex Hull (Geometric Computation) IV. Solving Polynomial Systems and SDPs via Structure Information (Optimization) Each of the four themes has a long history of earlier investigations in its principal domain. With these themes studied extensively for many years, it is becoming increasing evident that these four themes are closely related and inseparable. In fact, there are underlying mathematical structures, convex polytopes, matroids and polynomials common to all these themes. Our belief is that it makes much more sense to investigate them together. Our research team consists of active researchers, each with at least two domains of competence and strong interests in making this nontrivial fusion. (Jointly with: E. Feichtner, ETHZ, P.
