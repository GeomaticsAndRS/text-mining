  Polytopes, Matroids and Polynomial Systems â€“ Studies through the fusion of geometric, combinatorial and algebraic algorithms  
This project concerns research themes that interlink four domains: combinatorics, algebra, geometry and optimization. We study I. Classifications of Oriented Matroids II. State Polytopes of Polynomial Ideals  III. Minkowski Addition of Polytopes IV. Solving Polynomial Systems and SDPs
