  Setting and hardening control of advanced concrete  
With the combined use of set retarders and accelerators, more precisely fine portlandite we could narrowly control the setting time of cementitious systems containing sucrose up to cancelling the retarding effect of sucrose at portlandite amounts predicted by a sucroseportlandite adsorption isotherm
