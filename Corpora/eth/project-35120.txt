  Modelling atmospheric effects for long-term geomonitoring using ground-based radar interferometry  
Ground-based radar interferometry has the potential to reliably identify geometrical surface changes at mm- to sub-mm level. Its practical application is limited by atmospheric effects. We investigate their mitigation by spatio-temporal models calibrated using stable areas within the images.
