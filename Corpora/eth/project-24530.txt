  Modeling and Control of the Interaction Between the Human Cardiovascular System and Mechanical Circulatory Support  
This project aims at improving the monitoring and control of mechanical circulatory support. Criteria for optimal unloading of failing hearts are to be defined for assisting reverse remodeling.
The focus of this project is the development of strategies for the optimal unloading of the failing ventricle. The goal of this unloading is the recovery of the heart and a subsequent explantation of the mechanical circulatory support device. Challenges of this approach are the definition of proper parameters for the unloading; the development of estimation algorithms to monitor the chosen parameters; and the model-based development of control strategies to influence these parameters.
