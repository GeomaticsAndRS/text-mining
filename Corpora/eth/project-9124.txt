  Foundations of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics 
In this project, we attempt to derive most of the fundamental laws of thermodynamics from principles of quantum statistical mechanics. Included is a discussion of thermodynamic processes out of, but close to thermal equilibrium and of Onsager relations. 
It is attempted to derive the fundamental laws of thermodynamics from nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics. Included in our analysis are a study of return to equilibrium, of thermodynamic processes, a proof of a variant of the adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics, which we call 'isothermal theorem', and a detailed investigation of Carnot processes and of the degree of efficiency of heat engines. Our results have applications to transport theory and to a theory of metastable states. Among mathematical tools are the theory of relative enrtopy and new results in spectral theory of operators on Banach- and Hilbert spaces.
