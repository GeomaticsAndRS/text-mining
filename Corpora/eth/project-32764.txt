  Supported CeO2 catalysts for selective three-phase hydrogenation of functionalized alkynes  
We have recently discovered the outstanding catalytic properties of CeO2 as a selective catalyst for gas-phase partial hydrogenation of acetylene and propyne. In this work,  we have explored the performance of this intriguing material for the three-phase hydrogenation of functionalized acetylenics.
