  SCOOP: Dependable concurrent and distributed programming using object technology and Design by Contract (Hasler Foundation / SNF) 
The SCOOP project develops and implements a general model, based on  sound principles of software engineering, to make concurrent and distributed applications no more difficult to program, and trust, as traditional sequential applications.
SCOOP attempts to provide a systematic approach to the development of concurrent and distributed applications, covering a wide spectrum from multi-threading to Web services. The project's Web page provides details, including links to publications about SCOOP, and also offers the resulting software for download. The project is funded by a three-year grant from the Hasler Foundation, and a three-year grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation.
