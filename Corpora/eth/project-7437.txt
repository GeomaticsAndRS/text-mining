  Modelling of Deformation Mechanisms and the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility 

Two approaches to modelling the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) have been developed. The first method applies theoretical deformation models to a uniform distribution of uniaxial magnetic grains. Three deformation models which are considered are the passive, line/plane and viscous models of deformation. Empirical data were compared with predictions from the theoretical models. In the second approach a synthetic AMS is calculated from different distributions of basal plane poles of sheet silicates determined by x-ray texture goniometry. It is to be investigated how the AMS can be used as a quantitative indicator of the degree of the mineral fabric development.
