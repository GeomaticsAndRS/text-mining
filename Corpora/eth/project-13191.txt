  Sustainable Development of Constructed Switzerland 
We investigate the long term development of the Swiss residential building stock and its effects on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Of special interests are the long-term saving potentials and the capital which has to be provided to reach them. For this, a simulation model was developed.
In the research project Sustainable Development of Constructed Switzerland we investigate the long term development of the Swiss residential building stock and its effects on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Of special interests are the long-term saving potentials and the capital which has to be provided to reach them. For this, a simulation model was developed to analyse different scenarios until 2050.
