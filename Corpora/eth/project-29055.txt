Cellular Information Processing and Decision Making: from Noise to Robust Phenotypes (HFSP) 
Cell-to-cell variability is an essential aspect of cellular systems, and is caused by noise such as stochasticity in reactions and variability of expression levels of molecules. Despite the presence of such noise, signalling pathways process information and realise robust cell-fate decisions; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified. In this project we analyse information processing and robust cell-fate decision making in the ERK and AKT signalling pathways in eukaryotic cells. Tackling this problem requires a multidisciplinary approach: collecting data that probes the inner workings of a single cell is technically challenging, and interpreting the measurements of mRNA, protein and phosphorylated protein abundances is fraught with statistical difficulties. Here we combine complementary experimental approaches that capture different but overlapping aspects of signal transduction at the level of single cells, and that are able to assay large numbers of cells. This data will then be combined and analyzed in order to (i) reverse-engineer the structure and parameters of signal transduction networks; (ii) design further experiments that allow us to elucidate these models, or differentiate between sets of candidate models. The modelling approaches used by the team include statistical and control of systems as part of the modelling and inference procedures. We will then analyze these models in order to identify potential ways to exert control over cell-to-cell variability and hence guide cell-fate decision making. Such control mechanisms may, for example, include specific temporal profiles of administrating growth-factors and/or combinations thereof to cells. Such combinatorial interventions are more nuanced than existing approaches, which rely on simple stimulation patterns and perhaps only a single growth factor stimulus. We will evaluate these candidate strategies experimentally and will seek to extract design principles for such interventions from our combined experimental and theoretical analyses. We hypothesise that a functional core(s) of a system should be robust and supported by a set of functionally redundant non-essential genes, rather than essential genes. Finally, we will try to identify such a set of genes and a functional core for cell-fate determination.
