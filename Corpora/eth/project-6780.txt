  Development and Processing of High Performance Fibre ReinforcedAluminium Alloys  

 The research project deals with the development of new aluminium based metal matrix composites (MMC,,s) for application in lightweight construction and robotics technology. A new developed AlCuMgAg-alloy with excellent combination of strength and toughness is evaluated as matrix alloy for high performance MMC,,s. Due to the very high toughness of the matrix material it is expected for the composit to reach a toughness value comparable to that of equivalent commercial monolithic Al-alloys. Two production routes are considered, low pressure infiltration and the squeece casting process.
