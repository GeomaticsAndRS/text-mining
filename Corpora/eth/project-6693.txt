  Multivariate Linear Unmixing Models, with Application to Data from Ambient Air Monitoring Stations 
Linear mixing models describe multivariate data as convex linear combinations of a few fixed vectors (source profiles) plus random error ­ similarly to factor analysis. Statistical methods allow to estimate both these fixed vectors and the mixing coefficients on the basis of a dataset.
Current monitoring measurement of air pollutants in ambient air include many chemical compounds (such as volatile hydrocarbons) in hourly time resolution. Suppose that the pollution is generated by a small number of emission sources, each of which emits constant proportions of different chemical compounds. This idea corresponds to models of multivariate linear mixing, which are variations of Factor Analysis or Principal Components models. A PhD thesis by Marcel Wolbers concentrates on a specific stochastic mixing model and the related inference. The model treats the activities of the sources (scores) as random variables in addition to a multiplicative random error term. The work includes further results on a different type of models (with fixed scores). Further research concentrates on graphical methods which prove helpful in identifying and interpreting the sources (factors), checking assumptions and interpreting results.
