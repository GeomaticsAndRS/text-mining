  Heavy Flavour Physics in p-p Collisions at LHC  
In proton proton collisions at LHC, heavy flavours (charm, beauty and top) are copiously produced. The main aim is to study the various production mechanisms and compare them with theoretical predictions, based on perturbative QCD.  Further studies address the partonic structure of the proton.
