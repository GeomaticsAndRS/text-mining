  Growth and Engineering of Organic Nonlinear Optical andElectrooptic Thin Films by Molecular Layer Deposition 

 Nonlinear optical thin films are key elements in future optical devices for realizing high-speed, large-capacity information transmission and processing. Despite the extremely large nonlinear optical and electro-optical effects in some organic materials, the production of high quality organic thin films has been strongly hampered so far due to the large lattice mismatch and the weak interaction between the polar organic materials and inorganic substrates. In this project we grow organic thin films using a novel technique (OMLD), which utilizes sequential self-terminating growth of different organic monomers to fabricate polymeric thin films with periodic structures parallel to the surface so that the main charge transfer axis is along the polymeric chains. The availability of such unidirectional structures is a major breakthrough in optical organic thin films. Emphasis is given of the realization of different optical devices such as waveguides, optical switches, modulators, and frequency converters.
