  New Analysis Methods for Corrugated Laminates  
Our research addresses questions of the understanding of the mechanical behavior, the mechanical modeling, and design of corrugated laminates made from fiber-reinforced plastics.  New mechanical and structural models are needed for answering the questions and simulating the structural response.
