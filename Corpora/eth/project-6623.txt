  Swiss Food Composition Database  

 Food and nutrition related software tools are becoming increasingly popular. They are used onan individual basis to control diets for healthy people, to support patients who need to follow astrict diet and also on a larger scale to study the food consumption of selected populations.These software tools depend on high quality food composition data, which are currently notavailable in Switzerland in a coordinated way. At the initiative of the Swiss Federal Office ofPublic Health we started a project to develop a food composition database paying specialattention to foodstuffs available in Switzerland. Topics of the project include systemarchitecture, database and application design as well as strategies for data acquisition andcompiling. We are collaborating with national representatives of several European countriesindividually and collectively (COST 99) in the field of food coding and data quality standards tofacilitate food composition data exchange in Europe. We also investigate methods to publish theselected contents of the database in electronic form on computer networks for national andinternational access.
