  Vegetation-herbivory interactions in Tanzania; importance of N and P fluxes and stoichiometry 
This project is about the influence of large herbivores on nutrient cycling  and distribution in humid savanna, Tanzania. How do herbivores affect grass-tree coexistence and stability of savannas. We study (1) nutrient fluxes, (2) grass-tree competition, (3) decomposition of dung and plant litter.
Savannas are characterised by an unstable coexistence of grasses and trees, determined by water availability in dry savannas, while herbivores and fire have a dominant effect in more humid savannas. Positive feedback loops between herbivores and vegetation maintains nutrient (especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C)) cycling and promotes nutritional quality of the vegetation. In addition, herbivores redistribute nutrients through vegetation consumption somewhere, and deposition of dung and urine elsewhere. This nutrient redistribution can affect the grass-tree ratio in savannas. The aim of this research project is to determine the effect of wild herbivores on nutrient cycling and distribution and how these processes affect the grass-tree ratio in, and ultimately the long-term stability of, savannas. To reach this objective, we will focus on (1) a nutrient fluxes study, (2) a competition experiment between grasses and tree seedlings, and (3) a decomposition experiment.
