  Biocompatible, Low-cost Polymer-based Artificial Bacterial Flagella  
We will develop new processes for fabricating low-cost ABFs from biocompatible polymer materials. The controllable fabrication of these polymer-based ABFs is the first goal of this project, and is based on hot embossing and deep ultraviolet (DUV) induced modification of a polymer film.
We will develop new processes for fabricating low-cost ABFs from biocompatible polymer materials. The controllable fabrication of these polymer-based ABFs is the first goal of this project, and is based on hot embossing and deep ultraviolet (DUV) induced modification of a polymer film. When the patterned polymer ribbon is detached from the substrate by wet etching, it will scroll and self-organize to form a helical micro-/nanostructure. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is an excellent candidate for this purpose due to its biocompatiblity and ability to be hot embossed. Polycaprolactone (PCL), which is a biodegradable polymer, will also be investigated because it is preferred for drug delivery and is FDA approved. The second goal of the project is to investigate the mechanical properties of the as-fabricated polymer micro-/nanohelices and ensure that they exhibit stable mechanical properties over time. To actuate and steer the ABF, ferromagnetic particles will be embedded in the polymer and magnetized by an external, controlled field. Therefore, the third goal of the project is to experimentally analyze the swimming performance of the polymer ABF embedded with magnetic particles. During this third aspect of the project, the optimization of the shape and microstructure of the ABF will be considered for more efficient swimming and sufficient propulsive force. In addition, the manipulation of micro-objects and cells using the polymer helical swimmers will be conducted.
