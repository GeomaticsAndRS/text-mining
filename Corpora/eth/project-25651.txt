  Interplay between mismatch repair and other pathways of DNA metabolism 
Recent experimental evidence mplicated mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in several different pathways of DNA metabolism. Tantalizingly, the molecular role(s) of MMR proteins in these processes is not at all obvious. The scope of this program is to develop experimental systems that will help us elucida
