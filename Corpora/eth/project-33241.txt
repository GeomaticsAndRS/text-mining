CERN GBAR measurement of the free fall decay of anti-hydrogen
The GBar experiment is a collaboration of about 50 people (14 Institutes) that aims to measure the free fall decay of anti-hydrogen. The experiment was approved at CERN in 2012 and is expected to start data taking in 2017 after the commissioning of the ELENA ring (the upgrade of the anti-proton decelerator AD). ETH Zurich was among the initial proposer of the experiment and our main responsibility is the tracker to reconstruct the vertex of the anti-hydrogen annihilations in order to measure the free fall time and position. Extensive simulation has been performed to determine the most suitable type of detector and its geometry. In collaboration with CEA Saclay we plan to start the production of the first micromegas modules during the first semester of 2014. This will be tested and calibrated with cosmics at ETH and in 2016 we plan their commissioning at CERN.
