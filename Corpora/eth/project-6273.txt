  Comprehension of incineration processes in thermal treatment of solid waste by characterizingorganic carbon in solid residues  

 The municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) with grate type combusters does not achieve a complete mineralization of the organic materials. The solid residues as bottom ash and flue gas cleaning residues contain organic carbon, which is determined as TOC (total organic carbon). Chemical analytical methods have been developed to characterize TOC in these solid residues (St. Ferrari, 1997). TOC can be classified in four fractions: elemental carbon, nonextractable organic carbon, water extractable organic carbon and dichloromethane extractable organic carbon. Furthermore a thermal method of analysis has been developed for qualitative and quantitative determination of elemental and organic carbon. The aim of this project is to improve the understanding of processes in thermal treatment of solid waste with respect to decomposition of organics. The TOC characterization and the different process engineering parameters in MSWI's are combined to achieve a better comprehension of chemical and physical processes occurring in waste incineration.
