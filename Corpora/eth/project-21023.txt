  Fire Performance of blended cement in comparison to ordinary portland cement  
The aim of the research project is to enlarge the theoretical and experimental background on the fire performance of concrete made of blended cement in comparison to  ordinary Portland. Particular attention is given the reduction of concrete strength at high temperatures and during the cooling phase.
