  Low Dimensional Magnetism  
Non-classical phenomena in Quantum Spin Systems, including their ground states and dynamics are in focus of our research using neutron scattering techniques. Recent results have been obtained on dimer compounds, coupled spin tetrahedral systems and spin-bath concepts of quantum phase transition.
