  Acoustical Properties of Road Surfaces  

Because traffic noise is becoming an ever increasing problem, the question has  arisen as to what extent road surfaces are envolved with noise production. With a sound-measuring trailor it is possible to measure - under specific conditions rolling tire sound adjacent to the wheel. Under the same speed and tire conditions, the influence of the road surface on the noise produced can be measured. Among the surface courses, the porous asphalt layers offer advantageous acoustical properties, particularly at high traffic speeds. But also with conventional surfaces, considerable differences in noise generation have been measured. Thus further examination and optimization of the pavings' acoustical properties is needed. Additional studies on noise generating mechanisms should lead to appropriate surface designs. Another important point will be the examination of the relationship between noise levels obtained with the measuring trailor (noise emission) and "drive-by" traffic noise as measured by roadside microphones and its effect on the assessment of this nuisance.
