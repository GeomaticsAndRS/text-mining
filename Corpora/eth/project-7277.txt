  Four Channel Passive Telemetry System  

The implantable transponder (15x19x86 mm) transmits sensor signals with a  bandwidth of DC to 25 Hz via coupled loop antennas to the external base unit. The transponder, realised in SMT, consists of a RF-DC converter, a modulator, a VCO, a multiplexer, two strain gauges and two EMG amplifiers. During the first seconds when RF power is applied, an additional four channel start-up information signal is transmitted which contains values for identification, transponder temperature and internal reference voltages. A standard bi-directional serial communication interface between the external base unit and a PC allows real-time controlling and monitoring of the telemetry system. An analogue trend display on the base unit and on the PC screen are employed for visual presentation of the sensor data and for permanent performance checks of the system. The transponder operates in the near field of a 27 MHz loop antenna, using the principle of passive telemetry by absorption modulation. An energy transmission efficiency of 10 % and a bandwidth of 1 MHz can be guaranteed, provided that the coupling distance between the loop antennas is within the mean loop-antenna ´ 40 %. Remote control functions such as actuator steering and sampling diameter s rate selection can be added to the system for future applications.
