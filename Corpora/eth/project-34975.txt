  Towards the use of Pd-Zn catalysts in structured form for alkyne semi-hydrogenation 
This project aims at designing structured catalysts based on Pd-Zn for the  three-phase semi-hydrogenation of acetylenic compounds in continuous mode.
The partial hydrogenation of acetylenics is a key step in several industrial processes. To catalyze this reaction, the Lindlar catalyst (5 wt.% Pd on CaCO3 or BaSO4, treated with lead) has been extensively used for more than six decades due to its unique chemo and stereoselectivity. However, economic considerations associated with the high Pd content and environmental regulations regarding the use of lead provide incentives to seek alternatives to the Lindlar catalyst. Novel systems based on ligands have been developed in the last decade by following colloidal routes. The adsorbed ligand on these materials serves to isolate and tailor the accessibility of the active site and tune the energy landscape of the catalyst, similarly to the role of Pb in the Lindlar catalysts. Nevertheless, at present, long-chain substrates are not compatible with the use of the ligand-modified catalysts, due to steric hindrance. In this project, we are developing a novel family of alloyed catalysts based on Pd-Zn, altering the preparation method, the surface Pd-to-Zn composition, and the type of carrier. The active phase will be ultimately deposited on a stainless steel-based monolith prepared via nanoscale-manufacturing technologies in order to assess the applicability of a structured Pd-Zn catalyst in a continuously operated microreactor.
