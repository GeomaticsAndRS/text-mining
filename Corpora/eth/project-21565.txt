  Molecular imaging of hypoxia signaling 
Development of multimodal imaging strategies to visualize tissue hypoxia, stabilization of key molecules in the hypoxia signaling cascade (HIF and HIF targets)as well  as the physiological consequences of pathway activation. Methods used are PET, bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging, and MRI.
