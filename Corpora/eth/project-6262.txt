  Dynamic Model for Wood Management in Urban Systems (Xyloikos)  

At the end of the 20th century, wood is no longer a scarce resource in many industrial countries.  The question relating to the future role of wood as a renewable resource remains unanswered. A dynamic model is developed, calibrated with data of the time period 1800-1990. The effects of consumption changes show that timber rather than paper production should be strongely oriented towards regional forestry. Sustainable forestry practice is itself insufficient to attain a sustainable regional management of wood. A fair balance between production, processing, consumption, and disposal of wood is therefore additionally required. Intermediate results of the study can be found in: Müller D. , Szenarien zur nachhaltigen Holzbewirtschaftung, Schweiz.Z.Fortswes., 147 (1996) 11: 873-885 The final results of the project will appear at the end of 1998 in form of a Ph.D.Thesis at ETH Zurich
