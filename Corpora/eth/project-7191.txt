  The Knowledge Base of Professional Work  

Professions compete with one-another for services on the basis of their particular professional  knowledge; for instance, both engineers and natural scientists claim expertise in assessing contaminated sites. Our project aims at an analysis of professionalization in terms of links between professional knowledge and work, as theorized by Abbott (1988). Our main objectives are A) to test a specific method for assessing the link between knowledge and professional work (Mieg 1998/99); B) to determine the knowledge base for specific professional work, including a comparison of different degrees of professional education (academic / non-academic); C) to apply performance criteria for professional work, in order to assess the productive capacity of knowledge or human capital, respectively. We will compare Swiss environmental professionals, as an emerging profession, with Swiss engineers as an established profession. We will estimate the value of the role of professional associations for professional work and education in Switzerland. The project involves analysis of current data on the Swiss market for environmental and engineering services as well as data from the NFP 33. A new survey will be launched (N=3000). We are working in close cooperation with various professional associations.
