  PowerDB-XML 

Materialization and indexing of XML views is an important issue, and a number of 'XML-todatabase' mappings  have been proposed. The project PowerDB-XML aims at building a scalable system for XML document storage where those views are up-to-date. To this end, we must provide efficient implementations of basic services for query processing and updates. We are especially interested in services that support many 'XML-to-database' mappings. In order to achieve "unlimited" scalability, we implement such services on top of a database cluster. We build on composite transactions to support high-level parallelism of updates and queries without sacrificing correctness. With our prototype system, this yields linear scalability for updates, and query response times are interactive. For example, with high workloads of hundred concurrent clients and eight cluster components, response times of typical retrieval transactions are three seconds on average.
