  Man Machine Interaction - Communication: Emotions in HCI (Human Computer Interaction)  

 Automatic measures of emotional factors is interesting in areas like Human Computer Interaction, medical testing and in electronic mediated communication. This is a feasibility study aiming to establish guidelines for implementation of automatic capture of emotions. The capture is based on log-file analysis, including clarifications of ethical and methodological questions. The coherence between induced emotions and computer activities will be experimentally tested. A prototype will be developed, which demonstrates on-line interpretation of user activities.
