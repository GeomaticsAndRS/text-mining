  Surface structuring of bulk metallic glasses using ultrashort laser pulses  
In this project the feasibility of surface modification and surface patterning by means of ultrashort laser pulses is evaluated for bulk metallic glass-forming alloys. The effect  of cell growth and adhesion is investigated for various surface patterning conditions.
