  Electrophysiological assessment of the function of protein phosphatase 1 (PP
We are monitoring excitatory postsynaptic potentials extracellularly in CA1 hippocampal slices from mutant mice expressing a PP1 inhibitor and are evaluating the response to various stimuli. Several forms of synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and d
