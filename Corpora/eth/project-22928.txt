  e-QUILIBRIUM: Interactive Statics  

The e-QUILIBIRUM project aims to develop a comprehensive e-learning environment for structural design and analysis, in which architects and engineers of all skill levels can deepen their knowledge and understanding of structures. The project will be implemented as a dynamic website through which structures will be taught in an exciting and exploratory manner, using interactive drawings. The project will use intuitive, graphical approaches such as graphic statics, a powerful method for exploring structural form and the basis of the new curriculum for teaching structures in D-ARCH.
