  Graphene Nanomesh for Ultrafiltration and Nanofiltration  
An atom-thick semi-permeable membrane of graphene nanomesh could broaden our understanding on mass transport phenomena by breaking the Fickâ€™s law. Key to the successful study is to overcome nanomanufacturing challenges. We nanofabricate graphene nanomeshes to explore unique transport phenomena.
