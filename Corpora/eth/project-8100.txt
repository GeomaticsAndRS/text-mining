  The role of N-linked glycoproteins in Campylobacter jejuni 
N-linked protein glycosylation has generally been considered to be restricted to eukaryotes. Recently it has been discovered that the bacterium C. jejuni, a human pathogen, is able to glycosylate proteins. We analyze this pathway at a molecular level.
