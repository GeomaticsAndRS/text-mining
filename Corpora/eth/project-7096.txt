  The Val Roseg Project: Ecology of an alpine floodplain  

This comprehensive investigation of a glacial stream ecosystem studies the  influence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity on biodiversity patterns of zoobenthos, groundwater fauna and periphyton in a harsh environment, and on ecosystem processes such as productivity, decomposition processes and nutrient retention.
