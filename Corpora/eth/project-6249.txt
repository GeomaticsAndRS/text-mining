  Impulse waves in reservoirs  

Landslide generated impulse waves in reservoirs are an impending hazard to  populated areas in particularly higher mountain regions and in the vicinity of hydropower schemes, respectively. Impulse waves are triggered by the impact of rock, earth or ice slides on an undisturbed water body as for example in the case history of Vaiont, Italy (1963). Height and size of flood waves caused by rockslides and avalanches depend on distinct features, of which the most important are velocity, density and volume of the slide, its impact shape as well as stillwater depth in the impact area and the bias of the track involved. Hydraulic modelling is based on two different artificial granular materials of density and granulometry of natural rock and snow avalanche formation, respectively. These slides are accelerated by an novel pneumatic landslide generator with hill slope angles varying from 30\dg to 90\dg. The experiments are conducted in a rectangular prismatic water wave channel, where the governing wave features are illuminated using a pulsed laser light sheet and successively captured by a high resolution progressive scan CCD-camera. Subsequent acquisition and evaluation of instantaneous velocity fields is conducted using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Wave trains at surface level are also studied by suitable wave probes.
