  Adaptation in Classification  
In this research project , we examine whether the classification methods frequently used in machine learning theory are adaptive in a mathematical statistical sense. Tools will be results on adaptive estimation using complexity penalties. 
In pattern recognition or classification, objects are assumed to fall in one of two (possibly more) categories, say black or white, ill or healthy, at risk or safe, spam (junk mail) or not spam, etc. A classification is done according to the value of an observed instance, for example an image, a DNA micro-array, a collection of demographic variables, key words in the subject header of the mail, etc. One aims at predicting, with highest possible accuracy, to which category an object belongs. A classification rule is constructed by using a sample as training set (e.g. in the spam example, the emails one has received so far). In this research project , we examine whether the classification methods frequently used in machine learning theory are adaptive in a mathematical statistical sense. Tools will be results on adaptive estimation using complexity penalties. The complexity penalty may be for instance the number of variables used to arrive at a prediction. The goal of the project is to give some existing popular methods a firmer theoretical basis, and moreover to deduce guidelines from the theory for new, improved methods. We consider the results obtained so far for empirical risk minimizers, and extend them to other loss functions, such as exponential loss or support vector machine loss. The results will be tested on simulated and real data.
