  Traffic Safety and Geometry of Traffic Circles (Roundabouts)  

A great number of traffic circles (roundabouts) have been built in Switzerland within  the past few years, mainly replacing former conventional intersections. Despite a generally satisfactory safety record, the engineering practice regrets the lack of design standards. Since, an analysis of the accident records of traffic circles showed an improvement in traffic safety considering all facilities. However a more detailed study on a 2 years before and after basis reveiled large differences between facilities, in some cases even substantial increases in the number of accidents. Reasons for this fact could be local design and/or unfavourable traffic conditions. The study aims to identify correlations between geometric elements, accidents and traffic behavior in order to propose new standards for the design of traffic circles.
