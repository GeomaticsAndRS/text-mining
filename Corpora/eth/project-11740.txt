  The Mechanobiology of Chondrocytes and Mesenchymal Stem Cells 
The ability of stem cells to differentiate into numerous cell types (cartilage, bone, fat etc.) has made it a promising therapy for repair of many diseased and degenerated tissues. We are interested in using mechanical loading to direct the differentiation of the pluripotent cells towards a cartilag
