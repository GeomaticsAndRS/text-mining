  Petrological-thermomechanical numerical modeling of early Earth orogenic styles 
Evolution of orogenic styles through the EarthSs history is a highly debated and yet unresolved problem. We will address these issues using two- and three-dimensional petrological-thermomechanical numerical models of early Earth orogenic systems and global mantle convection.
