  Irradiation of chondrules in the early solar system?  
We will measure cosmic ray produced He and ne in situ in chondrules of primitive meteorites with short exposure ages by laser gas extraction, to search for possible cosmic ray produced excesses from an early irradiation 4.57 Gyr ago, before the chondrules were incorporated in larger parent bodies
