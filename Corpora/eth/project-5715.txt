  Impacts of the WTO millennium round on Swiss Agriculture  

The Swiss agriculture sector is highly protected by tariffs and subsidies.  It is expected that the millennium-round of the WTO (World Trade Organization) will result in a reduction of agricultural protection. Consequently Switzerland will also have to reduce its tariffs and subsidies. The impacts of this policy change are analyzed with general equilibrium model GTAP. This includes changes in quantities, prices and welfare. Since the quota of Swiss milk production has an important influence on Swiss agricultural policy, the GTAP-model must be modified by implementing production quotas.
