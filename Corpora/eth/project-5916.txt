  Heterologue Expression, Purification and Crystallisation of Active HumanThymidine Kinase (TK)  

Recombinant human cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) was obtained from Escherichia coli using a thrombin cleavable fusion protein. The TK was expressed as an inducible glutathione S-acetyl transferase (GST) fusion protein and was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Cleavage with thrombin led to nearly pure enzyme. The TK could further be purified from thrombin by ATP affinity chromatography, yielding pure TK. Both, the fusion protein and the purified enzyme show enzymatic activity. Determination of the native molecular weight indicated, that the pure enzyme and the fusion protein are biologically active as homotetramers. Therefore the recombinant enzyme has the same biochemical characteristics as the TK, expressed in human cells, and can be used for X-ray structure determination, with the aim to compare this structure with the structure of HSV I TK. We hope that this information allows us to develop new antiviral drugs with better properties.
