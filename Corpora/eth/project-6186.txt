  Optimum Dimensioning of Reinforced Concrete 3D Folded Plates  

The dimensioning procedure described in the above parent project is used for the  three-dimensional structures made up of flat panels arbitrarily oriented in space. The program user has the choice of assuming each of the panels as capable of withstanding only stretching forces, or both stretching forces and bending moments. Panels with different thicknesses can be eccentrically connected to one another. Thus, the program can be used for all kinds of general and special folded plate structures (e.g. offshore caissons, containers, etc.).
