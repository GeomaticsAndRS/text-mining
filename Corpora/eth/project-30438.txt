  Developing a global manufacturing footprint corresponding to volatile environments  
In todaySs business environment, the market is characterized by increasing volatility in demand volumes and types and simultaneously by decreasing customer tolerance time. Manufacturing companies have to tackle these challenges in particular by enhancing flexibility of the production capacities. 
Background: In todaySs business environment, the market is characterized by increasing volatility in demand volumes and types and simultaneously by decreasing customer tolerance time. Manufacturing companies have to tackle these challenges in particular by enhancing flexibility of the production capacities and reducing the burden of fix costs. As a consequence, an adaptation of the manufacturing strategy is essential. Motivation: Facing the above named challenges, globally operating companies have to review their value adding architecture and their control processes and align them in an integrative and comprehensive manufacturing strategy, in order to stay competitive. Associated problems arise: Which footprint is required for the flexible global allocation of production capacities? How can the manufacturing assets in the production network be optimally utilized? Which concepts and measures are required for enabling higher flexibility and responsiveness on the plant and network level? Objectives: The project has to main objectives: First, the project analyses existing concepts for aligning production networks regarding production footprint, make-or-buy-decision, as well as flexibility measures. Second, the project out-come encompasses a methodology, which supports manufacturing companies to implement measures for systematically enhancing agility in global business environment.
