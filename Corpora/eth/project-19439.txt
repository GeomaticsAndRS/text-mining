  Logarithmic components of the vacant set for random walk on a discrete torus (part of Thesis of David Windisch)  
the typical presence of components of logarithmic size outside the giant component left in the vacant set left by random walk on a dicrete torus of size n in dimension d run for times of order un^d, with u small, is proved.
