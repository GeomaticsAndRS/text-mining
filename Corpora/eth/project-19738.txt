  Building Control  
Investigating the potential of new information technology to control heating ventilation and air conditioning systems efficiently. Maintaining a desired indoor comfort despite external disturbances with a minimum of external energy.
Modern heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems utilizing latest information technology can increase the energy efficiency of a building significantly. One of the main tasks of an HVAC system is to maintain a good indoor comfort despite of changing weather and operating conditions. The progress in information technology leads to an increase of sensors and actuators in a building as well as in the availability of information about its occupancy and environment. Properly designed feedback control ensures the safe operation and robustness of the overall system. The research in the area of building control at the Automatic Control Laboratory at ETH is concerned with the development, design and testing of modern control systems in this field. Currently the focus is set on two projects: OptiControl: Investigate the potential of weather and occupancy forecasts and model predictive control to increase the energy efficiency in building climate control while maintaining occupant comfort. Energy efficient ventilation: Exploit distributed sensing and control techniques for the analysis, estimation and control of VAV controlled displacement and underfloor ventilation.
