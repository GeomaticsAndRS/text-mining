  Elastodynamic wave propagation in Functionally Graded Material (FGM)  
The project focuses on the analysis of phenomena that occur when elastodynamic (mechanical) waves interact with areas of gradually varying mechanical properties within  a structure.
Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs) are defined as materials featuring engineered gradual, spatial transitions in microstructure and/or composition, the presence of which is motivated by functional requirements that vary with location within component. An example: Hard and wear-resistant materials are used in order to keep the edge of a knife sharp for cutting purposes, but to improve the durability it is necessary to use strong and tough materials for the body of the blade. Abrupt transitions in material properties within a structure that result from these functional requirements lead to undesirable mechanical stress concentration promoting crack growth along the interfaces. The avoidance of such stress concentrations represents one application of Functionally Graded Materials. The project goal is the quantitative numerical analysis of the propagation of elastodynamic waves in Functionally Graded Materials. Results are compared and verified with experimental data obtained with a series of experiments performed at the Center of Mechanics ETH Zürich. The investigation of frequency dependent wave propagation phenomena itself, the dynamic stress distribution analysis for failure prevention, the material characterization, and new potential engineering applications are the major motivations of the project.
