  Order-Parameter Symmetry of Cuprate Superconductors  

A very important topic of research in superconductivity is to determine the symmetry of  the superconducting order parameter for the high-Tc materials. We perform phasesensitive tunneling experiments which indicate that YBa$_2$_3$_{6.9}$is not an s-wave-type superconductor. The results are more consistent with expectations for a d-wave order parameter. In order to measure phase shifts we study the magnetic response of two point-contact Josephson junctions (SQUID) between a conventional superconductor (Nb) and the material under investigation and compare them with the behaviour of an all-Nb SQUID. If the two Josephson junctions are on adjacent faces of the basal plane of the high-T$_c$cuprate material, then the combined critical current of both junctions will depend strongly on the symmetry of the order parameter. Extending these efforts, we have continued measurements on the related T$_c$= 60K YBa$_2$_3$_{6.6}$material. Instead of mechanical quasi point contact junctions we also investigate the behaviour of SQUID's completed with Pb film junctions of different geometry. Future experiments will include other cuprate materials like doped La$_{2-x}$_x$_4$and Bi-based copper-oxide.
