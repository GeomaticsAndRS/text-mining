  AMS Magnetic Field Measurement  

 The magnetic field within the volume of the large NdFeB magnet used for the 'Alpha Magnet Spectrometer' (AMS) is for constructional reasons not very homogenous. To be able to reconstruct the momentum of particles with a precision needed to reach the physics goals of the experiment, it is crucial to measure this field with very high precision beforehand. Since during the operation of AMS it is not possible to keep the temperature of the magnet on a constant value we do also have to investigate the temperature dependence of the field.
