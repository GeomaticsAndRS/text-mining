  Aboveground Phenotyping of Crop Plants in Abiotic Stress: Establishment of methods and test of applicability  
Crop plants show strong phenotypic variability in response to stress. This project investigates e.g. architecture, growth, photosynthesis, color and composition of different species and cultivars. Improvements in plant breeding will require automated phenotyping approaches as developed here.
