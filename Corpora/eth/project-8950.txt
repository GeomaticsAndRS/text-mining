  Management of driftwood during floods  
Based on several case studies and on systematic model tests, measures for (a) driftwood retention upstream of a critical flow section or for (b) improved driftwood routing trough critical flow sections are developped and design criteria elaborated, for both torrent streams and rivers. 
During floods, the obstruction of bridge crossings or culverts by driftwood can lead to inundation and thus cause considerable damage. Based on several case studies and on systematic model tests, different measures either for driftwood retention upstream of or for improved driftwood routing trough critical sections are developped. In a first phase, driftwood retention in existing debris basins was investigated. Large trash rack structures placed upstream of the check dam as well as solutions with an immersed wall located upstream of the check dam allow for driftwood retention. Two prototype structures designed with hydraulic experiments performed within this study were built on two torrents close to Sachseln (Canton Obwalden). The processes that obstruct bridge crossings and possible countermeasures are investigated during the second phase of the project.
