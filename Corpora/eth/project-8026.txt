  Synthesis, structures and properties of solids  
Novel compounds of borides, carbides, boride-carbides and nitridoborates and semimetal compounds (silicides, germanides, stannides), rare earth elements and intermetallic compounds (e.g. aluminides, gallides and indides) are investigated in selected ternary and higher phase systems.
