  Towards Sustainable Wastewater Treatment: Mass Transport Limitations, Microbial Diversity, and Nitrous Oxide Production in Anammox Nutrient Removal Processes 
We evaluate mechanisms leading to process instabilities in combined ammonia oxidation/anammox processes for nitrogen removal. The influence of mass transport on  microbial diversity and functional redundancy, nitrous oxide production, and robustness are determined.
