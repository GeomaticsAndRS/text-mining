  GRK2 inhibition in cardiovascular disease  
Exaggerated activity of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is a characteristic feature of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure. The project analyzes the impact of GRK2 inhibition on the development of signs of cardiovascular diseases by transgenic mouse techniques.
