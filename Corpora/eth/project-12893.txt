  Glacier outburst floods: A study of the processes controlling the drainage of glacier-dammed lakes  
Glacier outburst floods (jökulhlaups) are caused by the sudden drainage of glacier-dammed lakes. Jökulhlaups can pose a significant hazard potential. In a combined field and theoretical study on Gornergletscher the mechanisms leading to the sudden drainage of Gornersee are studied in detail.
