  Movement analysis in running with body-worn sensors 
We investigate monitoring of kinematics in running using ETHOS devices. ETHOS comprises the ETH Orientation Sensor, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for unconstrained monitoring of human movement. Sensor data is used for movement analysis considering technique, skill level, and injury risk.
Running is one of the most popular sport for the masses. Everybody can run, though not everyone might run properly. Most athletes, especially ambitioned fitness runners, might train on their own and thus rely on self perception. Therefore, a form of reportable measurement may be desirable. Common wearable devices for running performance assessment are stopwatches, heart rate monitors, and GPS trackers. However, these focus on assessment of the final performance rather than performance determining factors. Especially monitoring of kinematic features such as body segment orientation provides viable information about the athleteSs running technique. For kinematic analyses we developed ETHOS, a small, lightweight, unobtrusive inertial measurement unit (IMU) that allows for full body motion monitoring.
