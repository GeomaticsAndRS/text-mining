   Automated Heating Control for reduced Energy Consumption AHC U in Buildings  
This project prepares the market entry of a userfriendly, easy to integrate product to reduce thermal energy consumption of buildings. It contents the development of a retrofit solution, an automated heating valve control, and the business development for this product.
Within the scope of this project, an energy-autonomous, wireless and smart heating valve control will be developed. Wireless solutions for cable-free communication are already commercialized, but the missing power source is a major barrier for a successful market development. TodaySs wireless heating valves need regular replacement of batteries. That is not only bothersome and costly but also a burden on the environment. With an AHC driven by thermoelectric energy generation, the main barrier for a broad market application is eliminated. The consortium of this project brings in the latest technologies with low cost, easy-to-integrate thermoelectrics (greenTEG) and ultra-low power electronics (ZHAW, EM Microelectronics), experience in industrial design, product development and innovative business models (TU Munich, tado, Southpole) and features also one of the strongest European market channels with TA Heimeier. The developed product will allow building owners and users to reduce their energy consumption, save costs and live in a more convenient place.
