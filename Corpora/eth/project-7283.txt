  Characterization and Modeling of 0.4 um and 0.25 um CMOS for RF CircuitApplications  

 Test structures have been developed to characterize CMOS test transistors for high frequency applications. These test structures include various calibration structures to allow the intrinsic transistor to be de-embedded for modeling purposes. Using a direct parameter extraction method, the small signal equivalent circuit parameters are determined as a function of the bias voltages. This data is the basis of the non-linear model being developed for several CMOS processes. The model has shown good agreement with measurements for the 1 um process while the 0.4 um and 0.25 um models have not yet been completed. The final goal is to provide a feasible SPICE model for high frequency simulations. To test the model, various circuits have been designed such as Gilbert cell mixers, gain-enhanced Gilbert cell mixers and a few simple amplifiers.
