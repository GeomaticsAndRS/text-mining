  Hall Effect in underdoped YBa2 Cu3 O7- single crystals  

The observation of various anomalous features of the normal state of underdoped  YBa$_{2}$_{3}$_{7}$(YBCO) has renewed the interest in this type of material. It has previously been claimed by others that the temperature dependences of the Hall constant R$_{H}$(T) and of the Hall angle cot \gJ$_{H}$(T) give strong indications for a non-Fermi liquid type behaviour of fully doped YBCO in its normal state. We have been and are studying the electrical conductivity \gs and the Hall voltage V$_{H}$for a series of oxygen-deficient single crystalline specimens of YBCO as a function of temperature between 10 and 300 K. We confirm the previously reported relations R$_{H}$\sim T$^{-1}$and cot \gJ$_{H}$\sim T$^{2}$below room temperature but we note considerable deviations from this behaviour below a characteristic temperature T$^{*}$which increases with decreasing oxygen content. The characteristic negative Hall effect close to but below the critical temperature for superconductivity T$_{c}$disappears with increasing oxygen depletion.
