  Sustainable Materials Concept  
Sustainable Materials Concept: In situ recycling of spaceships in exploration missions 
Materials to build spacecrafts serve to date entirely the mission purpose, and no concepts are considered to make further use of them after mission life. Such concepts can add value especially to exploration missions if materials can be further utilised as biological or technical nutrients, i.e. recycled or converted into different and useful resources for other processes. This study should lead the way into advanced sustainable materials concepts based on the state of the art, that have a potential for future applications in exploration missions.
