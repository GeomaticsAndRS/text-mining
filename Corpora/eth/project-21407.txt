  Photoluminescence efficiency enhancement of silicon quantum dots using plasmonic nanoantennae 
The project deals with surface-plasmon enhanced luminescence of Si QDs by fabricating efficient nanoantennae. The coupling mechanisms are studied theoretically and experimentally by determining the emission intensity and lifetime modification of single Si QDs  coupled to plasmonic structures.
