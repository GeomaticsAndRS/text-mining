  The Swiss Robotic Disaster Recovery Challenge - Towards versatile robotic locomotion and manipulation  
This project aims at advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous robots with arms & legs in complex environments. It will enable robots to learn and reason about their dynamics, the environment and to plan and control these aspects for skillful full-body manipulation and fast dynamic locomotion.
