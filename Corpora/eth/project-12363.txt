  Coenzyme F430 from methanogenic archaea: Catalytic mechanism in methyl-coenzyme M reductase  
The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanism by which coenzyme F430 catalyzes the last step of biological methane formation in archaea. We study the reactivity  of the hydroporphinoid nickel complex coenzyme F430 as a model for its role in the key enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase.
