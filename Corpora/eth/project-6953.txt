  Zeolite-supported Fe-clusters for NOx removal and selective oxdation  

Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts were shown to be remarkably active and stable in the selective  catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrocarbons (NOx + HC $\to$N2 + H2O + CO2) as well as in the decomposition of N2O, a greenhouse gas produced, for example, in adipic acid plants. EXAFS work by our group has shown that the structure of the iron cluster in ZSM-5 resembles that of the iron center in methane monooxygenase, an enzyme that can catalyse the oxidation of methane to methanol. In the current project we are trying to exploit this similarity and to use the Fe catalysts for the selective oxidation of alkanes to the corresponding alcohols. The ultimate goal is to achieve the direct oxidation of methane to methanol, often deemed the "holy grail" of catalysis.
