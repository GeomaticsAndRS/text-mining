  How European is European Philosophy?  

The goal of the project is to develop a set of guidelines that lead through the geography and  history of Western philosophy. These guidelines are based upon the history of cultures and sciences. European philosophy, from its beginnings down to the Age of Enlightenment, cannot be understood properly without giving attention to its extra-European context. As European philosophy, ideas, and values are adopted by extra-European cultures today, cultural ingredients that were adopted in earlier historical periods by Europeans are returning to where they originated.
