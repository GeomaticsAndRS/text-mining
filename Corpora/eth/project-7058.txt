  Professorship for Sociology  

The independent professorship for Sociology was established in the fall of 1990. It consists  of one professor, three scientific and administrative collaborators and a varying number of associate researchers. The research emphasis is on social, economic and cultural change in advanced industrial societies. Activities are presently focused on five areas of research. (1) The mechanisms of intragenerational mobility and social stratification are investigated through analyses of occupational careers. Empirical research is based on both census data and a retrospective survey of two birth cohorts of 1949Ð51 and 1959Ð61 in the German-speaking region of Switzerland. Special consideration is given to the effects of social and technological change on occupational careers. (2) Another closely related research focus is the analysis of the determinants and effects of occupational further education. The impact of further education on horizontal and vertical mobility is studied by means of event-history analysis. (3) A comparative project investigates women's labor market transitions in the United States and Switzerland. It is aimed at gaining insight into the effects of diverse institutional structures on gender-related patterns of social stratification. (4) With regard to cultural change a research project investigates changing social identities and ideals of personhood in modern societies. It is based on a content-analysis of personal ads in Swiss newspapers covering the period 1900-1992. (5) A further research project studies the effects of changing social structures on violent crime in Swiss cities.
