  Tate cohomology of profinite groups  

It is possible to develop Tate cohomology for arbitrary profinite groups, such that a natural  universal property holds. The relationship between group theoretic properties and cohomological properties of these Tate groups is investigated. In particular, profinite groups with periodic continuous cohomology are studied.
