  Phytochemical and Biological Investigation of Zizyphus joazeiro and Torresea cearensis.  

 The aim of this project is to investigate the chemical richness of brasilian tropical plants. Zizyphus joazeiro C. Mart. (Rhamnaceae) is a small tree or brush which grows in northeastern Brazil. It is known like other species of the genus Zizyphus as a traditional remedy. The bark is used to treat fever. Chemical constituents previous reported from bark of the genus Zizyphus are triterpenoid saponins and cyclopeptide alkaloids. Another plant, growing in northeastern Brazil is the brush or tree Torresea cearensis A.C. Smith (Leguminosae, Papilionidae). It is reported to possess various medicinal properties such as anti-inflammatory and spasmolytic effects. Previous chemical investigations of the genus Torresea have yielded fatty acids, alkohols, and coumarins. Further, a peptide of MG 13.600, was found to be a potent inhibitor of serin proteases. An in depth biological and phytochemical investigation of these two plants are in progress.
