  Investigation of application possibilities of hydrothermal spallation drilling for deep geothermal heat mining 
Hydrothermal spallation drilling (HSD) is pursued as a novel drilling technology for geothermal applications. In this project the optimal process parameter for a hydrothermal spallation drilling tool and the possible application range are investigated.
