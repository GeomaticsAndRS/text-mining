  TRADR (Long-Term Human-Robot Teaming for Robot-Assisted Disaster Response, FP7-609763)  
TRADR develops novel S&T for human-robot teams to assist in disaster response efforts, over multiple missions
Using a proven-in-practice user-centric design methodology, TRADR develops novel S&T for human-robot teams to assist in disaster response efforts, over multiple missions: The novel S&T makes experience persistent. Various kinds of robots collaborate with human team members to explore the environment, and gather physical samples. Throughout this collaborative effort, TRADR enables the team to gradually develop its understanding of the disaster area over, multiple possibly asynchronous missions (persistent environment models), to improve team membersS understanding of how to work in the area (persistent multi-robot action models), and to improve team-work (persistent human-robot teaming). c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
