  Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security (PHP)  
The Parallel History Project provides new scholarly perspectives on contemporary international history by collecting, publishing, and interpreting formerly secret governmental documents. The main findings are published at www.php.isn.ethz.ch. 
In response to the declassification of NATO documents and the steadily growing availability of documents from the archives in Eastern and Central Europe, the Parallel History Project seeks to collect, analyze, and interpret these prime resources for the study of contemporary international history. As a cooperative undertaking of institutions and individuals dedicated to independent scholarly inquiry, the PHP brings together archivists, historians, and government officials. They locate, declassify, copy, translate, evaluate, and prepare documents for publication with commentaries from archives in Europe, North America, and Asia. The growing international network of PHP partners and associates benefits both the specialist academic community by providing new scholarly perspectives on the Cold War period and the wider public by disseminating the results of research in a readily accessible form. The findings are presented at conferences and published in print and multimedia volumes, as well as on the PHP website (www.php.isn.ethz.ch). Since its establishment in 1999, the project has collected thousands of pages of relevant material on security-related aspects of the Cold War and has published over 30 online document collections. The PHP is coordinated by Vojtech Mastny and run by the Center for Security Studies, Zurich; the National Security Archive, George Washington University, Washington, DC; the Institute for Strategy and Security Politics, Vienna; the Machiavelli Center for Cold War Studies, Florence; the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, Oslo; the Graduate Institute, Geneva; Aberystwyth University. It cooperates closely with a growing number of associates.
