  Influence of bFGF and IGF-I on Adult Rat Cardiomyocytes in Culture  

The effects of the growth factors bFGF-I on structural (actin cytoskeleton and  myofibrillar apparatus) remodelling and on the functional aspect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes have been followed during the hypertrophy reaction in long-term cultures. Cells attach to the substratum and spread into polygonal shapes with pseudopodia. A well structured actin network fills the cell bodies and the extensions. Untreated cells and cells with IGF-I double in volume while bFGF induces a six fold increase. The myofibrillar apparatus follows the actin stress fiber-like structures in growing out into the cell periphery. Immunoreactive ANF granules develop around the nuclear region. The fetally occurringalpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sm-actin) is re-expressed in stress fiber-like structures. IGF-I down-regulates alpha-sm-actin and ANF and promotes myofibrillar growth. bFGF has the opposite effect by up-regulating alpha-sm-actin and ANF. In addition, bFGF restricts myofibrillar growth with a sharp boundary in the nuclei associated region. Alpha-sm-actin seems to accumulate in stress fiber-like structures emanating from the myofibrillar area.
