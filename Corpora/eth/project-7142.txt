  RAMSES - Methodology of Computer-assisted Research Aids for Modeling andSimulationof Environmental Systems  

 Based on the modeling and systems theory by Wymore (1984) and Zeigler (1976, 1984) we work on the theoretical basis and the needed mathematical formalisms to model and simulate ill-defined systems, which are often studied in environmental sciences in various contexts. Workstation-aided structured, modular modeling and interactive simulation require software tools, to support an efficient and scientifically rigorous mathematical modeling and analysis of complex systems. Curent implementations of RAMSES tools are embedded in flexible system architectures to support not only text-book but real research needs typically arising in ecological modeling projects. Case studies (see other projects) allow to test the validity of the tools in supporting earlier as well as later phases of research. In earlier phases the emphasis is typically on the support of a flexible model development which can only be provided by an open, yet robust system architecture; in later phases the focus shifts to extensive simulation experiments such as sensitivity analysis, parameter identification, or optimal systems control. The current focus is on simulation servers (RASS) running within a local area network and supporting the batch execution of distributed simulation experiments of model definition programs originally developed only for an interactive environment.
