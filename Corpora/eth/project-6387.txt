  N-Linked Glycosylation of Proteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
N-linked protein glycosylation is a highly conserved pathway in all eukaryotic cells. We utilize the yeast system to establish the basic principles of the pathway.
Posttranslational N-linked glycosylation of secretory proteins follows a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells. In the central reaction of this process, the oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is transferred from the lipid-carrier dolichylpyrophosphate to selected asparagine residues of nascent polypeptide chains by the enzyme N-oligosaccharyltransferase. We use genetic approaches to identify components necessary for the enzymatic activity of the oligosaccharyltransferase and to isolate the corresponding genes. Until now, eight different components required for oligosaccharyltransferase activity in vivo have been identified. Similar genetic approaches allowed the characterization of the assembly pathway of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) substrate. In a series of complex reactions, the oligosaccharide is assembled at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is our goal to elucidate the organization as well as the topology of this biosynthetic pathway at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotic cells and to study these complex reactions using biochemical tools. For that purpose, in a collaborative effort, involving the Institutes of Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry and Microbiology, photoactivatable dolichol analogues are synthesized and used to identify the dolichol-recognizing protein domains of LLO biosynthetic enzymes.
