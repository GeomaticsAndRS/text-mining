  Guiding self-assembly via localised electric charges  

 Methods for the localised deposition of nanoparticles and molecules are developed that donot require masks, evaporation sources, or cleanroom equipment. Patterning is performed bylocally injecting electric charges into a suitable substrate using a conductive atomic forcemicroscope tip to which voltage pulses are applied. These trapped charges generate an electricfield above the surface attracting oppositely charged particles suspended in a carrier liquid(Adv. Mat. 13 (2001) 1395; Microelectronic Engineering 61-62 (2002) 671). The process maybe viewed as an extension of xerographic printing into the nanometer range. Establishing appropriate measuring techniques to characterize electrical properties on thenanometer scale is part of our efforts (Rev. Sci. Instrum. 70 (1999) 1756; J. Appl. Phys.84 (1998) 1168). These techniques are used in a broad spectrum of applications ranging fromquantitatively mapping electric potential and field distributions on solid state devices tothe surface structure and potential of biological samples.
