  ADAM: A Scalable Multiprocessor with a Multithreaded Architecture  

In the ADAM project, a scalable multiprocessor architecture has been  developped for the 4 - 256 processor range. ADAM incorporates ideas from previous data flow machines, hence its name (Advanced Dataflow Machine). ADAM is a homogeneous, distributed-memory machine, with built-in support for transparent access to remote data, for the management and synchronization of small processes, and for dynamic load balancing. A central goal of this design is to isolate the programmer from synchronization and scheduling details and to let the machine and the compiler jointly do this task. For this reason, the ADAM architecture has initially been optimized for the execution of dataflow languages, as these languages offer good support for the specification of parallel algorithms and for the automatic extraction of parallelism by the compiler. So far, a flexible and efficient simulator for the machine has been realized, and a prototype implementation based on M88100 type RISC processors is presently being built. Programs for ADAM may be written in either functional (SISAL, MFL) or imperative languages; for functional languages, data flow graphs are first generated automatically.
