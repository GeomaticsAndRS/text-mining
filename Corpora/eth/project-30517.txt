  Energy Demand and Energy Efficiency: A Stochastic Demand Frontier Approach  
In this project a relatively new method to estimate the level of energy efficiency based on the econometric estimation of an aggregate energy demand frontier is developed, discussed and applied. 
Trends in different measures of energy intensity are generally suggestive of trends in energy efficiency but the trends in energy intensity are likely to be influenced by factors other than just energy efficiency. In this project a relatively new method to estimate the level of energy efficiency based on the econometric estimation of an aggregate energy demand frontier is developed, discussed and applied. A frontier analysis is based on the estimation of a parametric, as well as a non-parametric, best practice frontier for the use of energy where the level of energy efficiency is computed as the difference between the actual energy use and the predicted energy use. In the empirical part of the presentation, an aggregate energy demand frontier function is estimated in order to isolate ´ the measure of Sunderlying energy efficiencyS explicitly controlling for income and price effects, population, climate, household density and the structure of the economy. This approach attempts ´ to isolate the Sunderlying energy efficiencyS for each state.
