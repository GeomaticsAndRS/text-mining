  Development of new strategies to maintain the high quality of foil-prepacked cheese by controlling the smear-microflora  
Smear-ripened cheeses which had been pre-packed for retailing can produce off-flavors through unknown surface microorganisms. The objective is to identify responsible mircroorganisms and off-flavors under such foil-wrapped conditionsand to develop biocontrol tools  to stabilize smear-microflora.
