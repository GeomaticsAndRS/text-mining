  Metabolomics of Shigella-infected Hela cells  
The infection of Hela cells by the pathogenic bacterium Shigella will be investigated towards a comprehensive understanding of infectious diseases and as a rational basis to develop control strategies. We develop and apply LC-HRMS methods for metabolite detection, identification, and quantification.
