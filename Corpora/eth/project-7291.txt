  Tandem-Electrode Multiple Quantum Well Laser for Short Distance Optical Links  

 AlGaAs tandem-electrode multiple quantum well lasers were investigated for the use in short-distance optical data links (e.g. optical card interconnects, LAN). Due to the bias condition one section is active (gain) and the other acts as a saturable absorber, which forces the device to self-pulsation. Compared to single section self-pulsing lasers, which are already used in optical interconnects, these lasers offer a better control of the optical parameters, such as pulsation frequency and coherence length. The characteristics of the lasers were estimated in detail. The measurement of the current-dependent gain and the voltage-dependent absorption yield better insight into the behaviour of the compound cavity. These measurements were also used for the numerical modelling of the device. For high speed data links high pulsation frequency and a low coherence length are required. To fulfil these needs the design of the lasers have to be improved. A simulation program was developed to calculate parameter dependencies in order to optimise the device. The model shows that it should be possible to archive transmission rates up to 3 Gb/s using an optimised design.
