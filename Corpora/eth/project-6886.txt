  Chemical and technological applications of high Rydberg states  

At high principal quantum number (n > 100) the high Rydberg states of atoms and molecules behave very differently than in the electronic ground state. The electron orbit is very large (ca. one micrometer at n = 100) the binding energy of the Rydberg electron is very small (ca. 10 cm-1 at n = 100), and the high Rydberg states are very easily perturbed by weak electric fields (the polarisability of a n = 100 Rydberg state is 1014 larger than in the ground state). In this project we are exploiting the unusual behaviour of high Rydberg states in a variety of applications in chemistry, physics and measurement technology. These include spectroscopic studies of radicals and ions, very accurate measurements of stray electric fields, ion spectroscopy and atom and molecule optics. Keywords: High Rydberg states, electric filed measurements, ion density measurements, ion spectroscopy, atom and molecule optics. References: F. Merkt, Chimia 54, 89 (2000); A. Osterwalder and F.
