  The Israeli Security Conception: Visible Changes?  

Security has always been one of the most crucial issues for the State of Israel. A mostly  hostile environment forced it to adapt a comprehensive security conception to withstand internal and external threats. This study traces the origins and the developments of Israel's traditional security conception which remained remarkably constant over time. It then proceeds to analyze the fundamental security-related changes in the global and regional environment leading to the Middle East peace process. As will be shown in the last part of this study, Israel has different possibilities to modify its security posture, depending on its perception of those changes.
