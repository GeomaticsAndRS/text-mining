  Network optimization for genomic data analysis and wireless system design  
The project focuses on the development of novel concepts and algorithms  for the optimization of large-scale network problems arising in two application domains, namely the study of gene regulation in living cells and the design of embedded systems based on wireless communication.
The project addresses two application domains, namely the study of gene regulation in living cells and the design of embedded systems based on wireless communication, and integrates them in an interdisciplinary approach by focusing on network optimization problems that arise in both areas and are characterized by similar features. The key objectives are: (i) The development of novel concepts and algorithms for the optimization of large-scale network models that is capable of simultaneously considering multiple criteria, that allows for uncertainty and noise in the system measurements and estimates, and that takes the modular organization of large networks into account; (ii) The integration of these methods into a hardware design methodology that facilitates the composition and configuration of wireless sensor and actuator networks with respect to conflicting design criteria; (iii) The identification of promoter motifs that are used in gene regulation by applying the network model optimization techniques to different sources of biological high-throughput data such as mRNA profiling data and protein-DNA interaction data.
