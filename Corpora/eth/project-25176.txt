  NARRATING COMPLEXITY: Rorty's Anti-Foundationalism and the Epistemological Legitimation of the Narrative Turn  
A turn toward narration may be seen today in several of the social sciences and the humanities. What is lacking, however, is a basic, pan-disciplinary theoretical reflection of this development. The present project aims to fill this gap and contribute to building a narratology of social complexity. 
Two opposing positions may be discerned in the way complex problems with a social dimension are described. On the one hand, we attempt to describe the problems empirically, theoretically or mathematically (through construction of models or simulations); on the other hand, there is a tendency to accept narrative descriptions as authoritative knowledge, and this in a variety of disciplines. These two approaches to problem description are obviously quite different and it seems that at their base are two quite different philosophical points of view, a difference that is also the basis of the philosophical conflict between essentialism and nominalism. A turn toward narration may be seen today in several of the social sciences and the humanities. What is lacking, however, is a basic, pan-disciplinary theoretical reflection of this development. The present project aims to fill this gap and contribute to building a narratology of social complexity which will examine the ontological and epistemological as well as the socio-political assumptions and consequences of this trend. The writing of Richard Rorty will stand in the focus of this investigation. This is because Rorty has consistently argued for a turn toward narrative and has integrated this appeal in a sophisticated philosophical train of thought.
