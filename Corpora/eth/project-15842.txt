  Light Vector Meson Production in e-p Collisions  

The studies of light vector mesons at HERA, such as rho- and phi-mesons, are sensitive to the nature of the diffractive interactions. They can provide information about the transition region between the hard interaction scales, where perturbative QCD is applicable, and the soft (long-range) regime, where the understanding of the QCD is still very limited and other models may prevail. Details of the meson production are investigated as functions of the photon-proton energy "W", the proton momentum transfer variable "t" and the photon virtuality "Q2", as well as the angular distributions of the decay products. The measurements are based on large clean statistical samples of rho and phi-mesons, which have become only available throught he advent of the special H1 fast track trigger FTT.
