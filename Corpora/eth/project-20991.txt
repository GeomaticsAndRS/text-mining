  Compound-specific radiocarbon analysis of lake sediments. 
We are developing the methodology for compound.specific radiocarbon dating of lipids. The aim is to study the long-term cycling of carbon in soils by analyzing soilderived biomarkers in lake sediments. In addition we will apply this method for radiocarbon dating  of Lake and marine sediments.
