  Diffusion weighted imaging at high and ultra-high field strengths  
Diffusion weighted imaging is a modality that produces in-vivo images  which contain information about the local microstructure characteristics of biological tissue. DWI is very useful to diagnose e.g. vascular strokes, or to study white matter connectivity and white matter diseases of the brain.
Diffusion weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging are methods which determine the alterations of the overall diffusion properties of water subsequent to pathological changes such as stroke. Alternatively, directional information can be extracted that enables the characterization of white-matter fiber structure and finally, the evaluation of the connectivity of the brain. This approach benefits from SNR gains at high field strengths. However the transition to high and ultra-high field strengths is hampered by shortened T2 and T2* relaxation and the marked increase in both, B0 and B1 inhomogeneity. In the present project, theses shortcomings are approached by new technological developments. To this end, fast imaging techniques such as parallel imaging techniques and compressed sensing are evaluated with respect to their capability of handling increased susceptibility. Furthermore, a novel technique that monitors field gradients directly on the basis of NMR field probes is investigated. This approach might enable to correct for errors in the k-space trajectory at the reconstruction stage and might enable measurements with novel, improved k-space trajectories.
