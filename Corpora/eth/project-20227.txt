  Defects and interfaces in topological and conformal field theory  
Defects and interfaces in two-dimensional field theories, the fusion of defects, the fusion of defects with boundaries. Description of background deformations in terms of defects.
Two different two dimensional theories can be joined along a one-dimensional interface. We investigate the physics of such interfaces. In particular, two interfaces can be "merged", resulting in a new interface, and likewise interfaces can be moved to boundaries, creating new boundary conditions from old. In general conformal field theory, such merging processes are generically singular and need to be regularized, whereas in topological field theories they are smooth. Results obtained so far: ­ Description of fusion of defects in Landau-Ginzburg models ­ Investigation of the behavior of D-branes (or boundary conditions) under bulk perturbations using defects, in particular in supersymmetric N=2 minimal models. ­ Fusion of interfaces in conformal field theory, in particular the example of the free boson. Uncovering of a structure reminiscent of BPS black holes. ­ Relation between defects in topological field theories and Fourier-Mukai-Transformations in mathematics.
