  Continuous dynamic controlled pore distance nano membrane emulsification  
New micro/nano membranes are developed with narrow pore diameter distribution and well defined pore distance. Such membranes are rotated with high speed to generate velocities of up to 50 m/s at a membrane fluid interface. Under such flow conditions drops  formed at the membrane surface are uniformly
