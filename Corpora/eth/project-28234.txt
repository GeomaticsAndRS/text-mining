  Understanding the mechanisms of cytotoxic response to aberrantly-folded and aggregated proteins. 
In this project we study the responses of cells to aberrant protein aggregation, by applying a combination of proteomics, phosphoproteomics and microscopy techniques. 
Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the intracellular or extracellular accumulation of aggregates of specific misfolded proteins. Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that such aberrant protein structures are directly implicated in triggering neuronal dysfunction and disease. However, the mechanism by which protein misfolding and aggregation cause cellular degeneration is still unclear. In this project we use different cell models of protein aggregation to characterize the cellular response triggered by the aberrantly folded and aggregated proteins. We apply integrated system-level analyses, including unbiased and targeted proteomics based on selected reaction monitoring and phosphoproteomic measurements.
