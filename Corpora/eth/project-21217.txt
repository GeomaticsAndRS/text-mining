  Improvement of the Kinematic Model of Switzerland (Swiss 4D-II)  
The geodetic deformations characteristics of the Swisstopo GNSS fundamental Networks will be analysed and the methods for generating kinematic models will be improved. This leads to a better kinematic model of the geodynamic processes for Switzerland.
The goal of this project is improving the existing kinematic model of crustal deformation in Switzerland (4D = 3 space coordinates + time). The model is based on precise measurements of the Swiss permanent GPS-Network (AGNES), on the reference frame (LV95) and on the Swiss height system LN02. Data from neighboring national networks will be used too, as far as possible, to improve the model near the country border. Precise measurements of reference points allow to track small movements (approx. 1 mm/year) which are used to calculate a three-dimensional discrete velocity field of the surface of the Earth' s crust. The strain rate field of the crust surface can be calculated from the three-dimensional velocity field, and is the basis for a tectonic interpretation. Vertical crustal movements are mainly related to the exhumation of the Alps and an enhanced seismic activity along the Alpine arc. Seismic activity can be interpreted as an impulsive release of elastic energy accumulated during crustal deformation and is, therefore, intimately related to the elastic energy density associated to the strain field (see graphics). The combination of geodetic, seismic and geologic information is the basis of a multidisciplinary approach to the geodynamics of the Alps and surrounding regions, and will provide a better understanding of the ongoing tectonic processes.
