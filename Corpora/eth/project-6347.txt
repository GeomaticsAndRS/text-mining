  Physical Environment - Aircraft noise study 2000  

The aim of this field study is the analysis of the influence of aircraft noise on human sleep.  The study consists of three parts: Part A is focussing on sleep of people living near Zurich airport. During several weeks, aircraft noise will be simulated in the bedroom of the subjects, varying the numbers of flights per night and the noise levels in a double-blind design. Sleep quality will be assessed on two levels: The physiological parameters will be measured with a Dormograph, a device developped especially for this purpose at the Institute of Hygiene and Applied Physiology. On the subjective level, a sleep diary and standardized questionnaires will be used. According to previous studies, sleep is upset more easily during the first and last hours of the night. Therefore, special emphasize will be placed on the beginning and the end of the sleep. The aim of part B is to assess whether the levels of stress hormones are affected by aircraft noise. The over-night-catecholamines in the morning urine will be analysed. Thus, effects of aircraft noise on the autonomous nervous system can be characterized. It is generally assumed that people show different reactions to the same physical noise event. Their noise annoyance is moderated by psychological factors like noise sensitivity, locus of control or stress. Part C of the project focuses on the development of noise annoyance judgement in people living around the airport. Possible moderating variables will be measured using standardized questionnaires. Moreover, the subjects will have a portable palm computer system where they can enter every single aircraft noise event and their subjective level of annoyance. The synthesis of the three parts A, B and C of this project will allow some further statements about the relationship of the physical aircraft noise events, sleep quality, stress hormone secretion, noise annoyance and intervening personality variables.
