  Development of spin-orbit coupling metallic magnets  
This project aims to develop spin-orbit-coupling metallic materials with large magnetic moments and strong anisotropy. In this context, we synthesize new metallic compounds in polycrystalline and single-crystalline form, and study in detail their microstructure and  magnetic properties.
