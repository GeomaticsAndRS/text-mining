VIGOR++ is an European research project that aims to create a personalised gastrointestinal tract model. This model is designed to facilitate accurate detection and grading of CrohnSs disease, so that the treatment of the disease becomes personalized, patient friendly, and effective.
VIGOR is an international research project that aims to create a personalised gastrointestinal tract model, which facilitates accurate detection and grading of CrohnSs disease, so that the management of the disease becomes personalized, patient friendly, and effective. VIGOR is supported by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission in the context of research towards the Virtual Physiological Human. The proposed technology builds on multiscale information from patients, including laboratory, MRI, colonoscopy and microscopy (histopathology) data. A novel integration of existing models is employed to predict features on the molecular to cellular scale (microscopy/colonoscopy) from descriptive properties at the organ to patient scales (MRI/laboratory). The benefits are early diagnosis, improved therapy planning and a better quality of life for patient. The techniques are integrated in the 3DNetMedical medical imaging cloud service, to make them immediately available in a clinically usable environment. Notably, tools could be rapidly commercialised and delivered as an optional toolbox to clinical sites.
