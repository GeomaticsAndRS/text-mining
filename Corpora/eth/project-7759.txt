  Decomposition in Ni-Au  
Local atomic arrangements to be studied by neutron scattering.
The phase diagram of Ni-Au for the solid state shows a broad miscibility gap at low temperatures and a solid solution ranging from pure Ni to pure Au at more elevated temperatures. Surprisingly,local order and not local decomposition has been reported for a state of Ni-60 at.% Au within the solid solution field, as a result from diffuse X-ray scattering that was subsequently corroborated by ab-initio electronic-structure calculations. In contrast to X-ray scattering, neutron scattering offers the advantage of obtaining elastic diffuse scattering without any large contribution from thermal diffuse scattering. Ni-rich single crystals are then required because of the large absorption cross-section of Au. Diffuse neutron scattering experiments of a Ni-8.4 at.% Au and a Ni-60 at.% Au single crystal (the Ni-58 isotope was used in both cases) were performed at the triple-axis spectrometers DruechaL and RITA-II (SINQ, Villigen PSI) at about 80 K and 30 K, respectively, above the miscibility gap. The advantage of the Ni-58 isotope over natural Ni (higher scattering contrast and lower value of the incoherent scattering) was a prerequisite to separate short-range order scattering and displacement scattering. The presence of local decomposition observed in the wide-angle scattering experiments, was also supported by small-angle neutron scattering (performed at SINQ, Villigen PSI).
