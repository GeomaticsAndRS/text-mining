  Evolution of Brine and Vapour Fluids in magmatic systems  
By combination of geology, fluid inclusion microanalysis and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the evolution of variably saline magmatic fluids during their ascent from magmas via porphyry-Cu-Mo-Au to epithermal Au-Ag deposits, using Famatina (Argentina) and other deposits as examples
