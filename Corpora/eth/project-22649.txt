The 3D-COFORM Consortium aims at establishing 3D documentation as an affordable, practical and effective mechanism for long term documentation of tangible cultural heritage.
The 3D-COFORM Consortium has one over-riding aim: to establish 3D documentation as an affordable, practical and effective mechanism for long term documentation of tangible cultural heritage. In order to make this happen the consortium is highly conscious that both the state of the art in 3D digitisation and the practical aspects of deployment in the sector must be addressed. Hence 3DCOFORM proposes an ambitious program of technical research, coupled with practical exercises c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
