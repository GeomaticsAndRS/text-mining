  Low Energy and High Comfort Housing in China 

 The Goal: Seeing the CO2 and the energy problem to be of global dimension and further realizing, Switzerland being just a small spot with a low construction activity, we have decided to take part in and to influence the worlds largest and most active construction market: China. Based on the theoretical background set by our chair, very advanced building technologies shall be transferred to China and adapted to the climates and living habits. In this way, a strong leverage effect from the small Switzerland to the large China should become reality. The Results: After some publications and conference contributions in China a large project with 708 apartments and 107 000 m2 living area could be optimized and equipped with a well insulating building envelope, external sun shading (first time in China) and an adapted HVAC system of thermally active floor slabs for heating and cooling and a displacement ventilation (also first time in China). It had a tremendous impact in China and the advertisement of the real estate developer put the STIPTOP-apartments with the slogan: SForget ¸ about air-conditioningT ¸ to the top of the building market and they became very famous for their excellent comfort. The sickness of SARS also made them well known, because they were the only buildings in China with no re-circulated air. In fact they attain about Minergy-level in Beijing with ca. 150 MJ/m2a for heating and cooling compared to about 800 MJ/m2a for the usual buildings today. Several further projects are now in planning in Shanghai and in Beijing. Some also are planned together with a famous colleague of ETHZ: Prof. D. Eberle for the architecture.
