  Infrared Spectroscopy, Vibration-, Rotation- and Reaction Dynamics, and Theory of HydrogenBond Molecules and Hydrogen Bond Clusters  

Hydrogen bonds, their structure and dynamics are of central importance for cluster formation in the vapour and homogeneous condensation of hydrogen bond liquids (such as water) as well as in biological macromolecules and biochemistry in general. The aim of this project is to study the quantum dynamics of the hydrogen bond with simple prototype molecules such as (HF)$_{2}$. The mode selective hydrogen bond exchange tunneling dynamics and dissociation has been elucidated by spectroscopy and quantum mechanical calculations. Current work involves large hydrogen bond clusters. Part of the computations in this project are carried out within C4 (Competence Center for Computational Chemistry).
