  Characterization of the adaptive traits of local cattle and assessment of product quality to promote the sustainable management of the dry forest ecosystems of Latin America 

Livestock husbandry plays a major role in the livelihood of local smallholders in Southern America. In rural areas of Bolivia like the Chaco dry forests, cattle kept extensively by smallholders are traditionally of Criollo genotype. Criollos are adapted to cope with challenging environmental conditions characterized by long and fluctuating dry seasons. The doctoral project was designed to gather knowledge about the internal (physiological, anatomical, microbial) and external (diet selection, behavior and habitat use) traits of adaptation of Criollos as compared to an exotic breed. Additionally, the meat quality of the Criollo cattle as compared to an exotic breed shall be assessed.
