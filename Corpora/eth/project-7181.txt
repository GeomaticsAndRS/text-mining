  Limiting factors of saproxylic insects: Habitat relationship of an endangered ecological group  

 Dead and decaying wood is one major component of European forests that has been nearly eradicated by silvicultural practices, although it provides habitat for a wide variety of species. Among these, saproxylic insects form the largest group. They do not only suffer from the destruction of their habitat, but also from the effects of isolation. Because most habitat requirements of saproxlic insects are exactly those elements lacking in commercial forests, some 90% of all saproxylic species are in need of protection. In our project, we will quantify the effects of the amount, quality, and spatial configuration of dead wood on species richness, diversity, and abundance of saproxylic Diptera and Coleoptera. The influences of light intensity, supply of flowers and habitat diversity will equally be considered. Our study is carried out in the Sihlwald, a forest in transition from managed to natural state, which has recently become a reserve. Our results will be interpreted on the basis of recent metapopulation concepts and habitat relationship models. Both approaches have strong predictive power on forest management and conservation planning.
