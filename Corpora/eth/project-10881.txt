  Structural investigations on a de novo designed amyloid 
We investigate the structure of the amyloid form of a simplified peptide sequence successfully designed de novo to fold into a coiled-coil conformation under ambient  conditions but to transform into amyloid fibrils at elevated temperatures. We have determined the crystal structure of th
