  Efficient Technologies and Systems for Mobility - Minimization of vehicular energy demand through Commingling and hybridization of thermoplastic composites  
Novel yarn technologies have the potential to facilitate the direct consolidation of of fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites. Commingled and hybridized yarns are investigated with regards to short-cycle, high-volume mass production techniques such as stamp forming.
