  Systems Ergonomics - a voice for tacit knowledge: better integration of user's knowledge andexperiences into the process of designing information-flow dependent technology. 

 Participation of those concerned by a change process has already proven to achieve a higher acceptance of the resulting solutions. But everybody knows more than he knows to say. Therefore the integration of users needs into technology intended for complex tasks also has to deal with tacit knowledge and implicite practices. Questions like those have to be solved: - How is information passing through the man-machine-system? - Where is information transformed? - How is it shared among co-workers? - How is the interaction with the machine and also with other machines? The investigation uses methods from work psychology and will result in a project management strategy for better user participation.
