  Antiferromagnetic Domain Statistics (with SHG) 
The project aims at the understanding of how antiferromagnetic domains form and how their distribution can be quantified by optical second harmonic generation.
The project aims at the understanding of how antiferromagnetic domains form and how their distribution can be quantified by optical second harmonic generation (SHG). To investigate the formation of antiferromagnetic domains we split the project into two parts: In the first part we observe antiferromagnetic domains in hexagonal RMnO3 compounds by measuring the SHG signal emitted by the sample in its antiferromagnetic state. In the second part we try to predict the total SHG signal emitted by the sample as a function of its domain wall distribution, based on a statistical model.
