  In situ product recovery from aqueous reaction solutions 
In situ product techniques for selective product removal from thermodynamically limited enyzme reactions or of labile or inhibitory products from fermentation broths  are investigated in order to improve process productivity.
In situ Product Removal to Improve the Fermentative Production of Antibiotics In situ product removal (ISPR) refers to methods that selectively remove a product from the vicinity of the biocatalyst as soon as it is formed. It is a well established tool to improve the productivity or yield of biocatalytic processes which are limited by inhibitory or toxic products, by an unfavorable position of equilibrium or by substantial loss of product due to decomposition. We investigate a number of technologies, including continuous chromatography (simulated moving bed, SMB), integrated adsorption, two-liquid phase cultivations, and membrane-based technologies. Model molecules include clavulanic acid, methionine, threonine, and various sugar compounds.
