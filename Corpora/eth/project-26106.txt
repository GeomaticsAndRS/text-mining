  Interactions and atomic displacements in Fe-based Invar systems  
Fe-rich Fe-Pt and Fe-Pd solid solutions are characterized using diffuse xray scattering to obtain information on static atomic displacements and local order. The chemical order is varied through different heat treatments, and the near-surface microstructure studied by  grazing incidence diffraction.
