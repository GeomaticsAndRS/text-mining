  A GIS Based Approach for Analyzing and Visualizing the Functions and Effects of DifferentBiotope Types 

 Landscape planning, and spatial planning in general, typically allocates one or several land uses to each area in a planning region. With this procedure, the functions of a landscape and its elements as well as the effects of a specific land use on its surroundings are more or less ignored. In the past decades the landscape of the pre-alpine region of Arth - Goldau in Central Switzerland has changed dramatically. With the AlpTransit project which is about to be realized this trend is expected to continue. The project uses rule-based modelling techniques in order to combine geographic and subject-specific landscape information. Additionally, statements on functional relationships and the effects of certain land uses will be shown.
