  PEGylation chemistry, PEGamers purification and PEGylated protein isomers characterisation  
The PEGylation of therapeutic proteins is of great interest to increase the circulation half-life of bio-molecules in the organism. A model is being developed to better understand the chemical reaction of PEGylation and the adsorption process during the downstream  chromatographic separation step.
Covalent binding of biocompatible polymers (as PEG) on proteins is known to increase dramatically the in-vivo circulation half-life of therapeutic proteins without affecting too much the pharmacodynamics of the drug. The two major challenges associated to this approach are the PEGylation chemical reaction and the purification engineering. The first aim of this PhD research project is focused on the investigation of the different PEGylation chemistries and on the optimization of the kinetic reaction. A second part of the PhD project is dedicated to the development of an adsorption model. This model will be applied for process design of preparative chromatography to purify the PEGylated proteins. The project should generate new insight regarding PEGylation reaction on one hand and on the adsorption process on the other hand in order to optimize the yield toward mono-PEGylated protein.
