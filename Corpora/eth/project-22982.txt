  Assessing oceanic paleo-productivity using silicon isotope variations in seawater and the biogenic opal sedimentary record  
Research focuses on studying the modern marine silicon cycle by analyzing the stable isotopic composition of silicon dissolved in seawater, including large ocean regions and local process studies oin the oceanic thermocline, combined with quantitative modeling of the Si cycle
