  NMR investigations of low-dimensional spin systems  
NMR investigations of low-dimensional spin systems, i.e., chains and ladders in copper oxide compounds. Studies of the general influence of frustration, defects and high external magnetic fields on the physical properties of this type of physical systems. Extensive use of computer-based model calcul
