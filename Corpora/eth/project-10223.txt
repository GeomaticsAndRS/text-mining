  Gene-general transcription Factor TFIID  
TFIID is the factor determining exactly where RNA pol II will begin transcribing a gene. Currently, we are assembling the 12-14 subunit TFIID complex recombinantly by coexpression using MultiBac, a baculovirus system we developed. 
The architecture of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex is of pivotal importance in the mechanism of transcription for the majority of genes in eukaryotic organisms. The gene-general protein factors which are components of the pre-initiation complex include TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH. We have determined the X-ray structures of the yeast and human TFIIA/TBP/DNA complexes [1, 2] as well as the dimerization domains of TFIIF [3]. TFIID is the factor determining exactly where RNA pol II will begin transcribing a gene. Currently, we are assembling the 12-14 subunit TFIID complex recombinantly by coexpression using MultiBac, a baculovirus system we developed [4]. So far, we have made several large TFIID subassemblies. Further developments in the expression technology have been implemented to permit production of the entire complex in sufficient quantity for high-resolution structure determination.
