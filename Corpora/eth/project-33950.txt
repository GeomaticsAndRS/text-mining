  Designer Single-Band Hubbard Material  
The single-band Hubbard model is believed to encompass much of the low-energy behaviour of the high-Tc superconducting cuprates and so much effort goes into understand it. Here we take a top-down approach and design a single-band Hubbard material from  first-principles calculations.
The "standard model" of condensed matter physics is widely regarded to be the Hubbard Model. It augments independent-electron band theory through a single parameter to account for electronelectron correlations and has been remarkably successful at addressing a range of correlation effects in transition-metal materials. However, beyond one dimension the problem is intractable and so much current research aims at finding appropriate approximations for obtaining the Hubbard model phase diagram. Here we take a new approach ­ we use ab initio methods to design a material whose Hamiltonian is exactly that of the Hubbard model so that its solution can be found by measuring the material properties. After identifying a crystal class and several appropriate chemistries, we use density functional theory to screen for the desired electronic band structure, and dynamical mean-field theory to study the Mott transition. Following this, we take the most promising candidate and address its structural stability, possibilities for doping and exotic superconductivity, and its similarity with the cuprate high-temperature superconductors.
