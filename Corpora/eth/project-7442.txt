  Iron Biomineralization in the Human Brain  

Human brain tissue taken from cadavers was evaluated to determine its  magnetic properties. Results of these magnetic studies indicate that biogenic magnetite or maghemite is present in the tissue. Tissue was also taken from epileptic patients during amygdalohippocampectomy and frozen in liquid nitrogen in order to preserve the brain chemistry and eliminate post-mortem chemical artefacts. Analyses of this tissue also reveal that magnetite and/or maghemite is present. In addition, possible sources of artefacts and contamination are being investigated. Preliminary results indicate that the magnetic material is not due to contamination.
