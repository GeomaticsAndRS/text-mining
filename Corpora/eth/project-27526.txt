This project aims to develop a novel multimodal biomechanical imaging method for integral assessment of bone microstructure and material properties and for better prediction of bone failure using multiscale modeling. 
This project aims to develop a novel multimodal biomechanical imaging method for integral assessment of bone microstructure and material properties and for better prediction of bone failure using multiscale modeling. The overall goal is to quantify and to map mineral particle orientation directly on the trabecular bone structure using a multiscale approach, providing 3D maps encoding local structural and material bone properties simultaneously. Multimodal imaging will include small-angle scattering (SAXS) tomography, which involves standard micro-computed tomography (¸ tCT), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), scanning SAXS, a novel SAXS pattern analysis, Raman imaging, as well as 3D computational imaging methods for interpretation of the multimodal results. Moreover, the project aims to create and solve multimodal non-linear finite element analysis (FE) models to quantify the influence of mineral particle orientation on trabecular bone mechanics using large-scale FE analysis and nanoindentation for cross-calibration. These results are expected to contribute to the ongoing development of multiscale FE models for a better prediction of bone fractures.
