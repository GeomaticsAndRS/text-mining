  Genomic analysis of the pathogenic wood rot fungus Armillaria ostoyae and characterisation of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions  
Armillaria species are significant components of the mycobiota of forest ecosystems . Based on the genome sequence and gene expression profiles during saprotrophic and parasitic growth, genes potentially involved in virulence of A. ostoyae will be identified.
Species of the basidiomycete genus Armillaria are significant components of the mycoflora of numerous forest ecosystems worldwide. As saprotrophic white rot fungi they are efficient decomposer of dead wood and as aggressive pathogens they cause root and butt rot on a wide variety of woody plants. In forests for timber production, fruit tree plantations or vineyards Armillaria can cause considerable economic losses. Armillaria species vary considerably in their pathogenicity and also within pathogenic Armillaria species, strains often differ in their virulence. Based on the genome sequence and gene expression profiles during saprotrophic and parasitic growth, genes potentially involved in virulence of A. ostoyae will be identified. Candidate genes will be studied in a larger set of A. ostoyae strains expressing different degrees of virulence and the expression of selected candidate genes during Armillaria infection of Picea abies seedlings will be explored. Knowledge about the genetic basis of virulence in Armillaria will improve the understanding of necrotrophic tree diseases and could eventually lead to the development of new control strategies for Armillaria root disease in forest stands and fruit tree plantations.
