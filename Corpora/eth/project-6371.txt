  Poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)  

 A key product produced by P. oleovorans during growth on alkanes is the biopolymer poly-3hydroxyoctanoic acid (PHA). The genetics, physiology and regulation of biopolyester synthesis have been and will continue to be studied in collaboration with several laboratories, including that of Dr. Th. Egli and Professor A. Zehnder at EAWAG. When biopolymers such as poly-3-hydroxyalkanoates are produced, these typically accumulate intracellularly. Here the cells must be broken open to release the products which are then processed and purified from the cell free extract. The application of PHAs requires experience in processing these materials. We are now looking at the uses of PHAs with the help of the polymer chemists in Zürich (see Collaborations). The production of PHAs by fermentation is likely to remain expensive. A long term alternative is to make such materials in plants and we have begun cloning bacterial genes which encode enzymes responsible for the synthesis of PHAs into potatoes. This work is carried out in consultation with Professor Potrykus (ETH). Contacts: Prof. B. Witholt, Dr. B. Kessler
