  ° DNA-AMPUDNA Adduct Molecular Probes: Elucidating the Diet-Cancer Connection at Chemical Resolution  
Food carcinogens may initiate gene mutations after forming DNA adducts. Our goals are to contribute basic knowledge and advanced experimental tools required to understand, on the basis of chemical structure, contributions of dietary chemical exposure and DNA  adduct formation to carcinogenesis.
