  Indoor Flying Machine Arena  
The Flying Machine Arena is a 10x10x10 m flight testing facility being constructed in ML Hall. It consists of an airspace with up to a dozen unmanned vehicles. The facility will be used to develop new algorithms for high performance autonomous flight, including formation flight and swarms.
Advances in sensors, actuators, and embedded computation have enabled the creation of small and relatively inexpensive agile flying platforms. The level of performance currently achieved by an experienced pilot via remote control greatly exceeds what is possible with an autopilot. There are many reasons for this performance gap, the main one being that human beings are incredibly adept at learning difficult tasks, given enough time. We are active in the development of new algorithms to minimize this gap. Our approach is to combine control concepts, such as Optimal Estimation and Control, Trajectory Control, and Iterative Learning Control, with computer science concepts such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The next logical step is the coordination of agile flying and ground vehicles. We are developing new distributed planning techniques based on motion primitives that guarantee collision-free flight in the presence of disturbances and communication non-idealities. Central to this research is the Indoor Flying Machine Arena, a 10x10x10 m flight testing facility being constructed in ML Hall. It consists of an airspace with up to a dozen unmanned vehicles, quadrirotor helicopters and ultra fast omni-directional ground vehicles. The localization system of c ETH Zürich, all rights reserved.
