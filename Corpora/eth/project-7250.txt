  ETHMICS: ETH Multimedia Communication System  

ETHMICS represents a flexible hardware/firmware platform for experiments  with new forms of interpersonal multimedia communication and the associated networking problems. Its two key components are a multimedia workstation (built around a commercial Macintosh workstation) and a switching module allowing for the contruction of scalable high-speed ATM-oriented intra- and interoffice local networks. One of the key aspects of the multimedia workstation is a novel architecture centered around a switch (implemented as a very high speed parallel bus) serving as a flexible interconnection medium between the network, various I/O devices (e.g. camera, display, SCSI disk, etc.) and the conventional workstation acting as a user front end. This approach avoids the bottlenecks encountered in conventional workstations when used for real-time multimedia data streams. Although our workstation is primarily targeted at broadband networks such as B-ISDN, attachments have also been developped for ISDN primary rate access and a 2 Mbit/s circuit switched network. Applications for ETHMICS may be developped ("woven") using LOOM, i.e. an object-oriented framework described elsewhere in this report.
