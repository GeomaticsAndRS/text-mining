  Feasability of topic models for daily routine monitoring 
We investigate the feasability of topic models for daily routine recognition. Using a daily routine simulation model performance, stability and therefore feasability of topic models in daily monitoring is explored.
The aging society introduces several difficulties into elderly care, one of them being the increasing number of elderly people to monitor on a regular basis. Extensive research is available regarding specific critical events but it might be feasible that tracking of daily routines allows reacting more robustly. For that reason probabilistic topic models as part of a three layer hierarchical model are investigated. Daily routines and their primitives of different structure are simulated (HMMs) based on real data sets and provide an input for the topic model to reveal its limitation.
