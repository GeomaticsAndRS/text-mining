  AC Magnetic Bearings and the Bearingless Induction Machine  

The bearingless induction machine has been realized successfully, and a basic  mathematical description has been established. However, many phenomena due to rotor eccentricities, lateral movement, saturation, and harmonics have not yet been investigated. The objective of the current research is an exact qualitative and quantitative description of the properties of the bearingless induction machine. This description may lead to the development of more sophisticated control algorithms for motor-integrated magnetic support and damping. A more precise mathematical model of the machine which contains specifications for rotor eccentricities and saturation has been defined. It is implemented in a simulation system that also models the power electronics circuit of the system. In the future, the quality of the model will be evaluated by comparison with the measurements from the testing plant. The model will also be used to extract data not accessible by direct measurement. The simulation program and testing plant are currently being implemented and will be verified experimentally by the end of this year.
