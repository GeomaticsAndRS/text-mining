  Market Managed Multi-service Internet (M3I)  

Project M3I "Market-Managed Multi-service Internet" aims  to design, implement and trial a next-generation system that will enable Internet resource management through market forces, specifically by enabling differential charging for multiple levels of service. The capabilities created by M3I create will increase the value of Internet services to customers through greater choice over price and quality, and reduced congestion. For the network provider, flexibility will be improved, management complexity reduced and hence revenues will increase. Price-based resource management pushes intelligence and hence complexity to the edges of the network, ensuring the same scalability and simplicity of the current Internet. A trial system will be designed and experimented with. It will enable ISPs to explore sophisticated charging options and business models with their customers.
