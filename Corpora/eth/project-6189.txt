  Numerical Simulation of Semiconductor Microdevices  

This long-term project in partnership with industrial firms was supported financially by the  Swiss government's "Commission for Advancement of Scientific Research (KWF)". The aim was to develop the general purpose program SESES (SEmiconductor SEnsor Simulation) for the numerical simulation of semiconductor microdevices used in sensors and other electronic components. The program can handle different nonlinear problems, from the relatively simple heat conduction equation to the extremely demanding drift-diffusion equations arising in the simulation of p-n junctions. The two- or three-dimensional regions to be investigated are first discretised into a small number of macroelements, which are then refined adaptively according to predefined criteria. This is achieved by a special algorithm based on a tree-type data structure, enabling the efficient solution of models with over 100,000 three-dimensional elements and a correspondingly large system of nonlinear equations. Since the numerical solution is based on the incremental iterative Newton-Raphson Method, the linearized system of equations has to be solved many times. For the latter the iterative conjugate gradient method with preconditioning was used. Various graphical features for visualising the results have been implemented in the program.
