  Macrolide- and tetracycline-adjustable siRNA-mediated gene silencing in mammalian cells using polymerase II-dependent promoter derivatives  
RNA interference has emerged as a powerful technology for downregulation of specific genes in cells and animals. We have pioneered macrolide- and tetracycline-adjustable short interfering RNA (siRNA) expression for conditional target gene translation fine-tuning in  mammalian/human cell lines.
