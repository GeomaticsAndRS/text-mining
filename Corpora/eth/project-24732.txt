  Genome-wide patterns of nucleotide diversity and divergence in wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon): inferences on demographic history, speciation, and natural selection  
This project will determine range-wide levels of nucleotide diversity for multiple wild tomato species, information that will be used to assess both the historical demography and modes of speciation, as well as evidence for natural selection having impacted levels of  diversity and divergence.
