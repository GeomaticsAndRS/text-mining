  Neurobiology of Signal Transduction  

Signal transduction between neurons is based not only on a variety of  neurotransmitters but also on a multiplicity of receptors for each transmitter which contributes to the fine tuning of the cellular response. In the brain, ion channels gated by the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA are prime examples of receptor heterogeneity, based on the combinatorial assembly of receptors from various subunits (15 genes). This project aims to identify the different GABA$_{A}$-receptor subtypes by their subunit composition and allocate them immuno-biochemically to identified neuronal circuits in the brain. These studies are the basis for defining the physiological significance of GABA$_{A}$-receptor heterogeneity in signal transduction. In addition, since GABA$_{A}$-receptors are major targets of drugs used in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy, these studies are also expected to lead to advanced subtype-specific therapies.
