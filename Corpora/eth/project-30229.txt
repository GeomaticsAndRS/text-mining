  Catwalk: A Quick Development Path for Performance Models  
Performance modeling is a very important technique to understand resource consumption and performance of parallel applications. This project aims at developing tools and techniques for performance modeling of scientific applications and to make those available to a wider audience of researchers. 
The cost of running applications at exascale will be tremendous. Reducing runtime and energy consumption of a code to a minimum is therefore crucial. Moreover, many existing applications suffer from inherent scalability limitations that will prevent them from running at exascale in the first place. Current tuning practices, which rely on diagnostic experiments, are insufficient because (i) they detect scalability problems too late in the development process when major effort has already been invested into an inadequate solution and (ii) they incur the extra cost of potentially numerous full-scale experiments. Analytic performance models, in contrast, allow application developers to address performance issues already during the design or prototyping phase. Unfortunately, the difficulties of creating such models combined with the lack of appropriate tool support still render performance modeling an esoteric discipline mastered only by a relatively small community of experts. The objective of this project is therefore to provide a flexible set of tools to support key activities of the performance modeling process, making this powerful methodology accessible to a wider audience of HPC application developers. The tool suite will be used to study and help improve the scalability of applications from life sciences, fluid dynamics, and particle physics.
