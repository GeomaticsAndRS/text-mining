  Permafrost temperature monitoring in Alpine rock walls: Borehole temperature measurement in the East Ridge of Jungfrau 
Since 1995, the rock temperature on the Jungfrau-Ostgrat is recorded in two boreholes in north and south direction.The main purpose of the study is to monitor the permafrost response to climate change, and to improve the understanding of the heat flow process in  alpine rock walls.
