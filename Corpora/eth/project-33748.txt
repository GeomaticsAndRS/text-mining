  Adequate sediment handling at high-head hydropower plants to increase scheme efficiency 
The research project aims at providing an improved hydraulic design guideline for desilting facilities at hydropower plants in Alpine region with an emphasis on the effects of different headwork arrangements by carrying out numerical simulations and field measurements.
With the proposed research project we aim at providing an improved hydraulic design guideline for desilting facilities at HPP with an emphasis on the effects of different headwork arrangements. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effect of the approach flow conditions on the behaviour of particle settling and the trapping efficiency of settling basins by means of field experiments and numerical simulations. The outputs of this investigation will help to advance the understanding of flow-sediment interactions in desilting basins under field conditions, and to provide a numerical tool to simulate and optimize desilting facilities to increase the scheme efficiency.
