  Railway Simulation  

The aim of this project is the development of a powerful and user-friendly simulation tool  for large railway networks. With this simulation, the effects of given timetables are calculated and anlaysed on given networks. All input-data are managed by graphic editors. The simulation tool needs three different kinds of input-data: - infrastructure data: exact description of the railway networks, on which the train operations are simulated - engine data: force/speed diagram and other technical data of all engines used - timetables. On one hand, the simulation results can uncover bottlenecks of planned infrastructure development and on the other hand, statements about the timetable stability of existing railway networks are possible.The prototype of the simulation model will be developed under the operating system NeXTSTEP 3.3 and later, it will be implemented on various other systems.
