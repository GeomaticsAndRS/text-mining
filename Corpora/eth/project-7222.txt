  Robust Demodulation in the UTRA Downlink with WCDMA  

This project addresses the analysis of the bit-error rate (BER) of the  conventional receiver and novel robust demodulation schemes for the UMTS downlink with WCDMA in interference limited scenarios caused by multipath propagation. Starting with a continuous time transmit signal which meets the specification of the UMTS air interface and a model of the mobile radio channel a discrete time signal model has been derived forming the basis of all investigated algorithms. A simple formula for an approximation of the minimum BER of the conventional receiver is provided which takes into account the interference. The addition of antenna elements to increase diversity and enhanced receiver concepts are suitable means to reduce the BER. These concepts are based on extended signal models which take into account interference in different ways. Three receiver concepts are derived applying the minimum mean-square error and maximum-likelihood criteria. One of them is a sequential scheme for blind interference cancellation which results by exploiting the structure of the spreading codes and applying the SAGE algorithm. It is shown in simulations that a linear time-variant equalizer improves the BER considerably for sufficiently accurate channel estimates. If the latter are based exclusively on the DPCCH within one slot, the blind interference cancellation scheme performs distinctively better than the conventional receiver. An estimation of the complexity of the different receiver concepts considered in this project shows that lower BERs can be achieved only at the expense of an increased implementation effort.
