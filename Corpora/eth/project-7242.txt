  SVOX: High-quality text-to-speech system for German  

The SVOX text-to-speech system is the result of several research  projects which addressed very different problems such as morphological and syntactic analysis of German words and sentences, accentuation and phrasing, prosody control (in particular fundamental frequency and phone duration), speech signal generation, etc. The major part of the investigations were concerned with the prosody control and the syntactic and morphological analysis. The present implementation of SVOX runs on Sparc/Unix workstations and is rather a research tool than a product, i.e., it has not been optimized in terms of processing power and memory requirements. It possible, however, to convert German texts in real-time into corresponding speech signals. The speech quality in terms of intelligibility and naturalness is very high compared to other German text-to-speech systems. In order to provide a first impression of the synthetic speech, there a some presynthesized examples and an interactive demo of SVOX is also available.
