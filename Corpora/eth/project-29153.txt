  3D Display Systems  
In this project we investigate novel ways to display 3D content. This includes topics like bandwidth improvement, transparency and beam steering.
Immersive 3D display systems have been topic to many research projects. However, current approaches require the viewer to wear head-mounted equipment (e.g. polarizing glasses) or they suffer from shallow depth or low spatial resolution (e.g. Integral Imaging). Furthermore, only very few systems address transparency, increasing immersion significantly. In this project, we analyze how bandwidth of automultiscopic displays can be improved to increase depth of field. Furthermore, we investigate how existing technology can be used to create transparent 3D. We also look into new technology, e.g. how to use controllable GRIN devices for beam steered 3D.
