  Polyproject PRIMALP: Sustainable Primary Production in the Alpine Region  

 The quickly changing ecological, economic, social, and political environments confront society and science with new challenges to solve existing and newly emerging conflicts which impede both a sustainable land use, and sustainable agriculture and forestry in the Alpine region. A broad interdisciplinary co-operation is required to develop improved technical, organisational and political concepts for sustainable primary production. Hence, the Polyproject PRlMALP has two main objectives: \md Identification and development of sustainable agricultural and forestry production systems for the Alpine region; \md Development of tools and models for the analysis and evaluation of infrastructure requirements and policy decision-making. Specific research topics are dealt with as individual projects. The results of the individual projects are integrated into the 'Core Project'. Within the scope of the Core Project, an optimisation model is built which serves as a tool for the evaluation of alternative production systems and for the development and communication of a consistent concept for resource-efficient and sustainable agriculture and forestry in mountain regions. This research is carried out within the scope of an interdisciplinary Polyproject funded by ETH Zurich. First projects started in May 1997. The overall project duration is five years.
