This task will focus on the research and development of novel approaches, toolsets and applications in the field of building systems integrated photovoltaics (BSIPV) using high-efficiency thin-film CIGS PV in conjunction with building-scale DC power grids and storage to optimally harness solar electricity. A key challenge for the successful application of CIGS-based BSIPV systems design in a building context is the occurrence of partial shading of PV cells that strongly influences efficiency and may cause overheating, and thus highly constrains design options. Using the DC output of PV systems directly in a building is a promising way of increasing the efficiency of the overall system as AC/DC conversions can be avoided. Recent studies have compared transformation losses arising in an all-DC network to an AC network in a residential context and concluded that there is an advantage of a DC network provided that there is a local DC generator, such as fuel cells or PV systems. Moreover, a recent study for residential buildings in the US concluded that energy savings of up to 15% are possible for a DC PV system compared to a traditional AC PV system in the case that local storage exists. In addition, 33% greater energy savings can be obtained by transitioning all appliances to DC-internal technologies in order to supply residential electricity demands. However, a study analysing the potentials for a DC network for the lighting in a commercial building concluded that while there are several industry-led standards for DC circuits in various applications, further research and development is required to reduce the costs of transition to an all-DC building.
