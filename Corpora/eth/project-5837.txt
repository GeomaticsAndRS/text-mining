  Numerical Simulation of non-Newtonian Fluid Flow through Compressible Porous Media  

Flow through compressible porous media is encountered in many areas - not only within the food industry. In addition to the compressibility of the porous media, fluids of interest in porous media often exhibit non-Newtonian behavior. When developing new processes, those two topics contribute to the difficulty in predicting macroscopic flow parameters (e.g. permeability) for a given system. In our 3-dimensional numerical simulation, we will treat porous media as an assemblage of regular periodic microelements deforming according to their position in the porous medium. For the calculations, a column of microelements is being investigated allowing for the prediction of the macroscopic flow parameters. Each simulation of the flow through an microelement depicts a single fluid-structure interaction problem to be solved. An iterative procedure will couple the calculations for the fluid part with the calculations for the deformation of the porous media. PLOY3D, a program developed by Prof. Tanguy based on the Finite Element Method (FEM), is used for the fluid flow calculations. This program is capable of calculating generalized non-Newtonian flow problems and some viscoelastic flow problems. A program based on the FEM will be developed to cope with the elastostatic large deformation contact problem, necessary to describe the deformation of the porous media.
