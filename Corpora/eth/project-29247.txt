  Interplay of strain and defect formation in perovskite materials  
A crystal under epitaxial strain may, depending on partial gaz pressures in it's environment, respond to strain by spontaneous formation of point defects. This project aims to predict such defect formation energies and rationalise their behaviour in terms of the electronic  structure.
Application of strain through heteroepitaxy has become an established route to engineering novel material properties such as multiferroism in perovskites. First principles calculations have been shown to accurately describe material properties as the in-plane lattice constants are changed by strain, and often indicate that large strain magnitudes (>4%) are required to induce new functionalities. At such large values, however, it is unclear whether strain will be accommodated primarily by changes in intrinsic lattice constants as usually assumed, or by the formation of point defects. Conversely, the use of strain to engineer point- defect concentrations and stoichiometry is largely unexplored. This project makes use of first-principles calculations to investigate the stability of perovskites and more generally oxides under bi-axial strain towards the formation of oxygen vacancies and to rationalise the underlying mechanism for strain-vacancy coupling in terms of the electronic structure. In manganite perovskites with 2+ A sites, the excess electrons associated with an oxygen vacancy occupy normally empty eg states of the Mn adjacent to the vacancy. This leads to a local expansion of the lattice and acts as a local relaxation of tensile strain. Oxygen vacancy formation is thus enhanced under tensile strain in these materials. In metallic nickelate perovsites on the other hand, no localization of the extra charge occurs and strain has a negligible effect on oxygen vacancy formation energetics.
