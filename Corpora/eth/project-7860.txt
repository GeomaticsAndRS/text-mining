  All-Optical Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Space Switch allowing Bidirectional Operation  

 A recent development is the monolithically integrated MZI all-optical space switch, that makes use of a Dual Order Mode (DOMO)-configuration, allowing bidirectional operation. This new arrangement uses a MZI-configuration for the data-signal (P$_{In}$), but couples the control-signal, which produces the refractive index change, as a first order mode into one MZI-branch . With this arrangement the control-signal is filtered out after the SOA, so that it can not anymore couple into the output-guides of the data-signal and bidirectional operation becomes possible. An other advantage of the DOMO structure is that the use of a first order mode allows to couple the control-signal into the MZI arm guiding the data-signal without additional loss for the data-signal, when making use of the novel first order multi-mode-interference couplers (see this report). The integration of these new couplers is responsible for the measured high fiber-fiber gain. We have realized this novel all-optical space switch and investigated its performances for bidirectional operation. When using the control- and data-signal in co-propagating mode, we found a 40 dB suppression of the control-signal (P$_{C}$) at the output-port for the signals (P$_{x}$and P$_{=}$), which is enough to allow this operation mode. Moreover we found excellent 8 dB fiber-fiber gain.
