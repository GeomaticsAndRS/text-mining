  History of Forests and Forestry  

The 'History of Forests and Forestry' Research Group is incorporated in the Section of Forest  Management and Planning and Forest Growth for organisational purposes only. Its research projects, however, concern also other sections, faculties and departments. The forest-historical research projects are, therefore, listed within the respective sections: Section of Forest Policy and Forest Economy (Schmith|sen): Jon Domenic Parolini: History of forest use in the area of the Swiss National Park. Section of Nature and Landscape Conservation (Ewald): Matthias B|rgi: Forest development in the 19th and 20th century - changes in forest use and management and habitat characteristics, at the example of the publicly-owned forests of the Unterland and Weinland regions (canton of Z|rich, Switzerland)
