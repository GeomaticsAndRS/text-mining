  Analysing the regenerative potential of PEMF-treated mesenchymal stem cells in equine cartilage regeneration  
In this collaboration project with Global Stem Cell Technologies, the beneficial effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields on the regenerative potential of equine mesenchymal stem cells will be investigated in vitro, using cell and organ culture experiments. In vivo experiments are anticipated.
