  InP Wavelength Demultiplexer  

Demultiplexers are key elements for the separation of optical channels in optical wavelength  division multiplexed (WDM) communication systems. We are investigating the fabrication and packaging of InP demultiplexer. Light of different wavelengths is fed into a planar waveguide section where it propagates without lateral guiding. A vertically etched grating reflects the light in wavelength dependent directions. Output waveguides collect the light of the appropriate wavelengths and feed it into optical fibres. The design of the grating is based on a Rowland circle construction. The demultiplexer is designed for four channels with the working wavelengths of 1548, 1552, 1556 and 1560 nm. A flip-chip technique was used to couple the input waveguide and the four output waveguides to a fiber array. Bends with 10 \gmm radius separate the waveguides to a pitch of 250 \gmm. For the use in fiber optical systems polarization independence of the WDM filter is strongly desired. This goal was achieved using a n$^{-}$/n$^{+}$-InP layer structure with very low birefringence. The transmission curves for TE and TM polarization show a shift below the resolution of the optical measurement setup. A demultiplexer chip mounted together with a receiver array has been fully packaged. The resulting module is capable to detect simultaneously four channel at 2.5 GBit/s. In the future we will fabricate an improved version of this module.
