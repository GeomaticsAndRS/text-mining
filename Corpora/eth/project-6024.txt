  Chloride in Concrete: Critical Content for the Initiation of Corrosion  

Chloride induced localized corrosion attacks are the main cause for failure and deterioration  of reinforced concrete structures. The "critical chloride" frequently cited in literature can not be considered a constant value, it depends on pH of the pore solution, environmental conditions (especially oxygen availability and concrete humidity). In simulated pore solutions the influence of pH and rebar quality on the critical chloride content is studied with electrochemical methods. Mortar samples with rebars, chloride- and pH sensors are exposed to alternate wetting / drying cycles in chloride containing solutions. With these experiments the critical chloride activity in the pore solution for the onset of corrosion can be obtained. With the same experimental setup the influence of different cement types on the critical chloride content for corrosion initiation is studied. A further goal of the project is to study the behavior and durability of a novel chloride sensor.
