  VarCity (ERC Grant)  
VarCity aims to drastically innovate 3D city modelling, moving it away from the traditional, bottom-up Lidar or structure-from-motion pipelines. Not only will large-scale city modelling be automated, but the results will look more realistic, will be more compact and will be semantically structured. 
VarCity aims to drastically innovate 3D city modelling, moving it away from the traditional, bottom-up Lidar or structure-from-motion pipelines. Not only will large-scale city modelling be automated, but the results will look more realistic, will be more compact and will be semantically structured. Moreover, the dynamics of traffic flows will be added as animations (to safeguard anonymity) and videos of special events and landmarks can be retrieved with the 3D model as geographical context. These videos of flows and events are again automatically analysed and combined. For the combination of multiple event videos, a virtual editor will be implemented, ensuring compilations of high quality and providing an excellent overview whenever possible. The overall result will be an augmented, live Google street.
