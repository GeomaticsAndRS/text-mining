  Linking Diffusional Heterogeneity and Aquatic Habitat Fragmentation with Microbial Coexistence and Diversity in the Vadose Zone  
Soil is the richest habitat for microbial life in the biosphere. We investigate key a biotic factors promoting such unparalleled diversity in complex pore spaces with dynamic and heterogeneous diffusion fields. Models of microbial coexistence on unsaturated rough surfaces elucidate dominant factors
