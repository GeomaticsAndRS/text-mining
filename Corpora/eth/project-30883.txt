  Mechanisms of Mechanotransduction in Human Intervertebral Disc Cells upon Stimulation with PEMF or Strain 
As various modalities of mechanical loading have been shown to promote anabolism in the disc and could thus be beneficial in disc regeneration and repair, the aim of this project is to confirm that the calcium pathway put into play by PEMFs corresponds to that activated by mechanical stimuli.
