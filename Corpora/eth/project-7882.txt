  Serial Receiver Front-Ends for Passive Optical Networks  

In computer systems passive optical network are foreseen to replace electrical parallel bus  interconnects, increasing throughput and reliability. Multiple subsystems are connected through a shared optical medium, e.g. fibre links with a passive star. Data is transmitted in packets, one transmitter after the other is allowed to talk. The receivers have to adapt quickly to the incoming packets which may differ in clock frequency and phase as well as in amplitude. AC-coupled receiver front-ends for both 531 Mbit/s and 2.5 Gbit/s are developed on a semicustom 0.8 \gmm silicon bipolar technology (Siemens Corporate Research). Resilience, large dynamic range and high supply-noise rejection were the major design targets. The receiver front end block consists of a preamplifier, a high-pass filter (DC-block) and an output buffer. Tests carried out at ETH Zurich and at GEC Marconi, Caswell, UK, have shown reliable operation over a large range of optical input power, supply voltage and temperature. The receiver front ends are currently used by GEC Marconi in prototype transceiver modules for avionic and telecomm applications.
