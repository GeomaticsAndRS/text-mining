  Selective Compliance Aerofoils with Variable Stiffness Multi-stable Elements for Morphing Applications  
In this project a novel design approach for selective compliance systems embedding purely elastic variable stiffness elements to realise morphing structures is investigated.  The obtained stiffness variability promises to address the conflicting requirements to achieve significant shape adaptation.
