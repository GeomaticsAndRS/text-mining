  Betonstahlbruchortung mittels magnetischer Streufeldmethode / Break Detection in Reinforcing Bars Using the Magnetic Flux Leakage Method  
Tests are planned to localize breaks in the reinforcement of concrete structures by measuring the magnetic flux leakage fields of the reinforcing bars. The aim of this investigation is to develop a modular measurement system and to gain experience interpreting experimental data.
Through condition assessment of concrete structures almost no breaks of the reinforcement have been detected so far. Possible explanations are that breaks have not been specifically searched for and are hard to detect by non-destructive testing methods. The magnetic flux leakage (MFL) method has the potential to fill this gap. A break in a steel bar leads to a change of sign in the magnetic flux density which can be measured using Hall sensors. Since the early 1980s, the MFL method has been used to localize wire breaks in prestressing tendons. As the flux density decreases by the power of three with the distance, the spacing between tendon and sensor is crucial. Common reinforcing bars are placed closer to the concrete surface than prestressed tendons. Thus, breaks in reinforcing bars should be even easier to detect than in prestressing tendons. The aim of this project is to develop a measurement system, which is able to detect breaks of reinforcing bars. Different specimens with predefined reinforcement layouts including breaks of reinforcing bars are prepared. The reinforcement is magnetized and the magnetic flux density is measured to get typical patterns for each setting. For data interpretation imaging techniques will be applied.
