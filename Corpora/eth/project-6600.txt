  Advanced Coordination of Multimedia Information  

ETH World will consist of many heterogeneous information sources that contain different types  of multimedia documents. In such an environment, information about the same piece of real world is often stored in several independently developed and autonomously administered information sources. For example, there are databases storing information about projects or courses. Similar information is also available on the web. Although, from a global point of view, there are dependencies among these different information sources, there is no direct link between them and the information cannot be updated consistently in all sources. Such deficiencies, which usually are the result of some local update activity, lead to a decrease of information quality. In order to keep track of dependencies among various information sources, advanced transactional coordination is required. This includes the monitoring of local update activities and the initiation of appropriate steps (encompassed within coordination processes) to re-establish global consistency. The aim of this project is to develop a prototype that supports transactional coordination processes across several multimedia information sources. Publish & subscribe techniques will be exploited to provide a coordination framework that is seamlessly extensible to new types of multimedia information sources.
