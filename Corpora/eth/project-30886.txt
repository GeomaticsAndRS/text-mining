  Investigation of the Regenerative Effects of porcine Notochordal Cells onto bovine Intervertebral Disc Cells under Co-culture  
This project aims to conduct co-culture experiments of notochordal cells and nucleus pulposus cells, seeded in 3D alginate beads under conditions with and without cell-cell contact, i.e. either fluorescently labeled in the same bead or separated by a membrane insert.
