  Origins and Effects of Normative Commitments  
An open debate in the development of legal institutions is whether individuals obey the law because the law incentivizes or because the law has legitimacy and tells individuals what is the right thing to do. 
(1) Normative Commitments in Health Care: Daniel ChenSs group will measure the influence of pharmaceutical company payments to physicians on their normative commitments (prescriptions). They will evaluate the effects of payments on patient outcomes. They will build on their work on disclosure laws affecting physician payments to see if disclosure laws affect the relationship between payments, prescriptions, and patient outcomes and the role of physician thought leaders with pharmaceutical company associations. (2) Normative Commitments in Courts: The group will examine the influence of group identity on judgesS normative commitments (decisions). They will build on our work documenting the causal effects of group identity in judicial decision-making. They will use the random assignment of judges in common law courts to measure the impact of exogenous changes in legal precedent. They will apply our LASSO method for two-stage least squares estimation because of the combina-torial possible number of judicial characteristics as instrumental variables. They will study the effects of 24 legal areas, including sexual harassment, free speech, gay rights, and disability rights, for which data has already been collected. They will use our data to study the origin of rights and will automate our methodology with machine learning to facilitate legal policy impact analyses.
