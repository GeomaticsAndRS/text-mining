  Development of new genetic tools for regulated gene expression and knock-out in the mouse brain  
To optimize the application of mouse models to study complex behaviors, we are developing molecular tools for temporally- and spatially-restricted gene expression, recombination and/or rescue in the brain. Novel promoters are being established for genetic manipulations in specific brain subfields.
