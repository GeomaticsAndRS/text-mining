  The Wisenberg Panorama of Samuel Birmann (1813) and Peter Schmid-Ruosch (1990)  

 In 1813, Samuel Birmann, the well-known Basel landscape artist, painted a panorama (more than four metres in length) of the peak of the Wisenberg mountain (lower Hauenstein area), which at that time was still free of forest. Without knowing of Birmann's work, the Basel panoramapainter Peter Schmid-Ruosch repeated this all-round view a good 180 years later, including 1000 names. These two views, together with an accompanying 36-page text written by K. M. Tanner, are now being published in a set by the Canton of Basel-Landschaft publishing house (Verlag des Kantons Basel-Landschaft).
