  3-for-2 Project: Reaching Beyond Efficiency 
The 3-for-2 Beyond Efficiency project of the Low Exergy Module at the Future Cities Lab in Singapore together with the United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) implements and tests novel ways of cooling and dehumidification in an office building in Singapore.
The 3-for-2 Beyond Efficiency project of the Low Exergy Module at the Future Cities Lab in Singapore together with the United World College of South East Asia (UWCSEA) implements and tests novel ways of cooling and dehumidification in an office building in Singapore. These systems contain water-based cooling systems, which have not yet been implemented in an office building in this tropical context. The novel integration of such systems to reduce the space necessary is also an innovation of the project.
