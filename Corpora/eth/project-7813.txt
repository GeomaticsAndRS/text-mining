  Study of Cuprates and Related Compounds, Chevrel Phase Compounds  

 Present studies aim at a better understanding of magnetic and spin fluctuation phenomena in rare earth substituted 1-2-3 compounds, of phase separation phenomena in La$_{2}$_{4}$single crystals and of the systematics of the magnetic penetration depth in Chevrel phase compounds.
