  Measurement of the electric dipole moment of the neutron  
A permanent neutron electric dipole moment would violate time reversal. Its discovery will have major implications for fundamental physics. With an international collaboration and using the new source for ultracold neutrons at PSI, our project aims at an experiment improved by 2 orders of magnitude.
