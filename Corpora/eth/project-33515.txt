  Interleukin 17-mediated host defense mechanisms against fungal pathogens  

Pathogenic fungi have emerged as increasingly frequent causes of infections. Although some fungi belong to the normal intestinal flora in healthy individuals, they can cause severe disease when host defenses are breached. IL-17-mediated immunity has emerged as a crucial defense mechanism against fungal infections. Although the field of IL-17 biology has attracts a lot of interest, it is not well understood how IL-17 mediates host protection. In addition, new members of the IL-17 cytokine family have recently been identified and it remains unclear if and how these also contribute to host protection. This project investigates the molecular and cellular effector mechanisms of IL-17-mediated immunity in the highly relevant context of fungal infection. In particular, it will dissect the differential roles of individual IL-17 family members that together orchestrate the antifungal response. This will provide new insights into basic immunological principles and may open up new perspectives towards the development of therapeutic strategies.
