  Consulting System for Bridge Construction  

The program BRIDGES has been developed to determine the optimum shuttering geometry  and predict the long-term deformation of concrete bridges. The computation is not only carried out for the final state, but the process of each construction step is also simulated following a planned schedule, which can be updated at any time. The program guides the site engineer in the critical phases during construction. The program, based on the Finite-Element Method, handles temperature, humidity and ageing development in the concrete, as well as an artificial cooling system and the prediction of the risk of cracking. The system includes ordinary reinforcement and prestressing. This Consulting System, written in C++ for the operating system Unix, is highly object-oriented. It is conceived as an expandable framework for bridge construction simulation. A previous version of the program has been used with success for the Storebaelt West Bridge in Denmark.
