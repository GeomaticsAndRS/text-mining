  Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Dissipative Quantum Systems  
In solid state-based quantum information processing, external control in quantum optics, quantum transport through meso- and nanoscale structures, quantum tunneling in macroscopic systems, quantum Brownian motors, and biological reactions, for example, quantum dissipation is an import subject. 
In the context of solid state-based quantum information processing, external control in quantum optics, quantum transport through meso- and nanoscale structures, quantum tunneling in macroscopic systems, quantum Brownian motors, and biological reactions, for example, quantum dissipation is an important subject. We have proposed a general thermodynamic framework for dissipative quantum systems in weak contact with classical equilibrium and nonequilibrium environments that leads to quantum master equations. The proposed formulation is guided by classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics, based entirely on geometric concepts and, in principle, applicable to arbitrarily complex quantum subsystems and classical environments. Geometric structures are employed to construct reversible and irreversible dynamics from energy and entropy landscapes. Some simple illustrations have been given.
