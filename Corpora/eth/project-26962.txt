  Effectiveness study of individual and organizational level stress management interventions at work 

This ProDoc research module is part of the ProDoc programme Health@Work, a joint initiative of three universities (University of Zurich, Federal Institute of Technology ETH, Zurich, and the University of Lausanne). This research module covers an in-depth longitudinal analysis of the effectiveness of a comprehensive stress management intervention at the workplace. The research module is designed for two PhD projects. One PhD project will focus on "Individual and organizational level job demands and resources and employee health in the context of a multilevel organizational stress management intervention study". The other PhD project will concentrate on the research question, which process variables account for the intervention's success.
