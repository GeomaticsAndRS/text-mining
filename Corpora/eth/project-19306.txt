  SmartShunt - The Hydrocephalus Project  
The multidisciplinary research project aims at conducting the basic research necessary for the subsequent development of a smart cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
DeveBased on the project SBiothermofluidics ¸ for Cerebrospinal Fluid Diagnostics and Control U lopment of a Knowledge BaseT, the multidisciplinary research project SSmartShunt ¸ U The Hydro aims at conducting the basic research necessary for the subsequent development cephalus ProjectT of a smart cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Current treatment methods Today, NPH is most commonly treated by the surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that drains CSF from the patientSs ventricular space to the peritoneal area. Current shunts rely on differential-pressure valves to control CSF drainage. Although such shunts are available and used since the 1960s, the failure rate is still very high. The three most common causes of failure are obstructions, infections and overdrainage.

Goals of the project - Mathematical modeling of the relevant human physiology - Buildup of hardware-in-the-loop test bench for the assessment of current and future shunts - Development of suitable hardware components - Determination of control strategies
