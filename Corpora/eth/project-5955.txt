  Phytochemical and Biological Studies of Medicinal Plants from PapuaNew Guinea  

 The tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea (PNG) hold a tremendous wealth of as yet uninvestigated plant species. Ethnopharmacological studies carried out by Holdsworth et al. showed the use of many of these plants for medicinal purposes by the indigenous people. In the course of our project two collecting trips to PNG were undertaken and 40 plant species were obtained. Biological screenings of the plant extracts showed that several of them possess interesting levels of activities. These extracts are under further investigation for their active principles. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the petroleum ether extract of Dillenia papuana led to the isolation of a series of antibacterial triterpenoids. The structural variety of these seven isolated analogues of olean-12-en-30-oic acid permitted some structural requirements for the observed activity to be proposed. The dichloromethane extract of Macaranga pleiostemona was shown to be antibacterial. From this extract of the leaves four antibacterial prenylated flavanones were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by the analysis of their spectroscopical data. Phytochemical and biological investigations of Homalanthus nervosus (used in PNG to treat ulcers and sores) and of Rhus taitensis (used in PNG for treatment of boils and ulcer) are in progress.
