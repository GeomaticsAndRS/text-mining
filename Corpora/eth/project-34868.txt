  Operando studies on the role of CO2 in the conversion of syngas to methanol over industrial catalysts 
This project aims at elucidating the promotional effect by CO2 in metha-  nol synthesis in terms of metal structure and environment as well as of surface intermediates over a commercial Cu-ZnO-Al2O3 catalyst by operando XAS and DRIFTS studies.
In a previous project, we identified a strongly promotional effect by co-feeding CO2 in the conversion of syngas to methanol depending on the interaction of Cu with ZnO in the catalyst. For this purpose, we built a set-up to conduct catalytic evaluation under realistic conditions and developed a novel testing methodology that enables the investigation of the catalytic performance depending on the dynamic nature of Cu-ZnO-based catalysts by subsequently changing the concentration of CO2 in the feed. However, due to the multiple equilibria in the complex reaction network, the multicomponent nature of the industrially utilized catalyst, and the wide variety of feed compositions applied, the full complexity of this effect can be hardly unraveled through ex situ characterization of the catalysts. No operando study, monitoring alterations in surface composition as a function of the syngas composition and catalyst history, has been reported in the open literature, justifying the need to confront this important fundamental aspect. Accordingly, we currently conduct X-ray absorption (XAS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopic (DRIFTS) studies over a commercial methanol synthesis catalyst to uncover variations in the distribution and oxidation states of surface metals and the presence of adsorbates in response to variable feed compositions (CO/H2/CO2/H2O).
