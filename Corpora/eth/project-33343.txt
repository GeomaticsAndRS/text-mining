  Measuring CSR: an outcome-based approach  
We employ data of negative corporate newspaper reports collected by "RepRisk" as a CSR outcome variable. We model this variable as the joint outcome of two separate processes: (1) a bad (or no) CSR policy and (2) the probability of detection of such behaviour, given (1). 
We employ data of negative newspaper reports about corporations collected by the data provider RepRisk as a CSR outcome variable. Our approach is based on the notion that negative newspaper reports are driven by two separate processes: (1) a bad (or no) CSR policy and (2) the probability of detection of such a behaviour, given (1). We infer the probability that a given firm does not pursue a CSR strategy from process (1). To be able to disentangle these two processes (we observe only the joint outcome of both), we use the detection controlled estimation approach of Feinstein (1987, 1990). Furthermore, we use this measure as the basis to perform portfolio sorts and explore if the returns of different CSR-groups are distinct.
