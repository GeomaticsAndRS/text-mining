  Mass Spectrometric Investigations of Gaseous Ion-ligand Equilibria  

The theoretical solvation of aqueous species and ions is paramount to the understanding  of the properties under most conditions of relevance to reactions occurring in crustal fluids. These solvation properties are still not adequately represented through theoretical means even at relatively low temperatures and pressures. This research program involves the construction of a pulsed-electron high pressure mass spectrometer designed specifically to investigate fundamental solvation of positive and negative ions with water and other solvents. Additional work is underway developing electrospray ionization for ion-ligand clustering equilibria. These data will allow theoretical analyses of solvation and are planned to help in the development of new theoretical approaches for the prediction of high temperature and pressure properties of various important geological species. The same measurements are also directly informative on the nature and chemistry of volcanic gas reactions and gaseous species in the stratosphere.
