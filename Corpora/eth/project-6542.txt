  International Research Network on Forest Law and Environmental Legislation  

 The International Research Network provides contributions from members of the IUFRO Research Group 6.1300 Forest Law and Environmental Legislation. Its focus is on forest law development and implementation regulating sustainable uses of forests, biodiversity conservation, different forms of forest and tree tenures, public and private land management systems, and incentives to promote sustainable land owners' activities. Sector and cross-sector impacts on forest conservation and sustainable forestry practices from legislation on environmental protection, nature and landscape conservation, wildlife management, water and soil conservation, and rural development are examined. Research reports are published at regural intervals; a bibliography with contributions 1984-2000 is available.
