  Fluid Focussing in Orogenesis  

 Thermal modelling has indicated that metamorphic "hot spots" require intense focussing of magmatic fluids. The focussing factors (ratio of areas of source to transport region for such "hot spots" appear to lie between 100 and 1000. Mass-balance constraints of mineral deposits and thermal constraints in geothermal systems indicate focussing factors of around 10. Field studies are being conducted in metamorphic rocks to locate the fluid pathways and to attempt to resolve the apparent discrepancies in focussing factors.
