  Sustainability and Urban Structuring in the Lowlands of Switzerland (Synoikos)  

 In the Swiss lowlands a region of a about 200 km2 with roughly 100'000 inhabitants is chosen to study, in atransdisciplinary approach, the following questions: - What are the main criteria to evaluate a sustainable development of an urban region? - How can these criteria be applied for the architectural restructuring of the settlement area, for territorial management, and for its relation to the other ecosystems within the region (e.g. forests, surface waters, agricultural land)? - Which are the ecological potentials of the region to supply the essential resources (e.g. water, food, energy, construction material) on the long-term?
