  Optical Generation of Microwaves Using a Dual-Polarization Emission External CavitySemiconductor Diode Laser  

 The optical generation and fiber transmission of microwaves are of increasing interest because of their application potential in the distribution of broadband mobile communication services. We have demonstrated the generation of tunable microwaves by means of the beat frequency between two spectral modes of a single CW-driven external cavity diode laser (ECDL). The two modes oscillate simultaneously, one in TE and the other in TM polarization. This dual-mode operation has been achieved by the use of a two-arm polarization-selective external cavity where the photon lifetimes for TE and TM can be adjusted independently by setting the transmission of the variable attenuators. By changing the grating angle of one external cavity arm and the appropriate variable attenuator the spectral separation of the two modes could be tuned from nearly zero to more than 10 nm corresponding to a beat frequency tunable up to more than 1000 GHz.
