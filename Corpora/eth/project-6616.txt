  Information Technology and General Education  

Since about 1995 information technology (IT) applications touch more than half  of all working places in Switzerland, and in private appartments we find already hundreds of thousands of small computers. At the same time many general schools of different levels (gymnasium/high school, elementary school) find it difficult to shape their introduction courses to the computer world ("computer lessons") in such a way that students get not only user knowledge but also some elementary information technology knowledge. This is important to understand the growing information society and should therefore become part of the general education. Discussions on the contents of "computer lessons" are still too often dominated either by computer enthusiasts or by opponents to any renewal at all. In many schools computer contacts are limited to the use of standard applications. In this situation, and especially in cases where qualified teachers are missing, teaching aids and experiments are needed to promote the understanding of basic concepts of IT (programs, data, communication, structure, search methods etc.), first for teachers, second for students. This project promotes development and distribution of such activities.
