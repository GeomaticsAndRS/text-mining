  Morphological stability of accretionary wedges: Record from the river system and morphotectonics of the Iranian Makran  
The study of river terraces on the Iranian part of the Makran accretionary wedge will document the surface response to active subduction processes. The project involves fieldwork, DEM analysis of topography and dating for correlations.
