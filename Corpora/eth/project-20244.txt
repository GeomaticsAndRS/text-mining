  Localization, Mott Transition and Colossal Magnetoresistance  
We have started a theoretical study of Anderson localization, a Mott transition, magnetic ordering and colossal negative magnetoresistance in Eu_x Ca_1-x B_6. Our analysis is based on experimental results established in the groups of Ott and Fisk. Our study is analytical. 
We attempt to provide a theoretical interpretation of experimental results on Eu_x Ca_1-x B_6 found in the groups of Ott and Fisk. We study the magnetic ordering observed in this substance at low temperature, the Mott transition from metallic behavior at large x to an insulator at small x and the colossal negative magnetoresistance observed when an external magnetic field is turned on. Our study is primarily analytical. Our results are a mixture of mathematical results and heuristic ones.
