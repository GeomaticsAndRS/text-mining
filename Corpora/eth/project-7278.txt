  Coupling Antennas for an Implanted Infusion Pump  

In this project, the transfer of energy from a body-mounted RF-generator to an  implanted infusion pump is investigated. The wireless remote powering of the implant is usually achieved with two inductively coupled loop antennas. The implanted device is packed in a flat titanium housing approximately 70 mm in diameter and 10 mm in height. A high efficiency of energy transfer is required because internal energy storage capacitors must be fully charged within a few seconds by the external device. Transmission characteristics are mainly determined by the geometry and the tuning of the two loop antennas. The design which achieved the required efficiency is an antenna wire mounted in a small groove around the circumference of the implanted housing with a small air gap between the antenna and the housing. Measurements for different distances between the antenna and housing confirmed a high transmission efficiency. A distance of 4 mm between antenna and housing is maintained by an insulator which also separates the antenna from the implant's environment. The efficiency of energy transmission amounts also in cases of geometrical misalignment to 20% or more. The next step in this project will be the development of a remote control channel by modulating the output power of the RF-generator.
