  Scaling Laws for Low Temperature Extrusion Processes  
Low temperature extrusion is a new processing technique for frozen food systems like ice cream which has been invented at the LMVT laboratory (ETHZ).Under very high viscous forces, microstructuring components, are much more finely dispersed than possible by conventional treatment. Scaling laws are i
