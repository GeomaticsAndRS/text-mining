  Technology of Middle Ages Stucco Work  

Figurative stucco work from the Middle Ages is of particularly high value. The work that is  still "in situ" in Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland, and the archaeological finds in the depository of museums and offices of building preservation, are inadequately or completely un-researched, though they are, from the point of view of conservation, in extreme danger. Therefore a group of experts from these countries has decided on a collaborative project. The provisional goal was an exhibition of the already analysed archaeological finds from the Hildesheim churches in the Diözesanmuseum in Hildesheim (together with the Curator, Dr. Brand), and now a publication on the art-historical meaning, technology and color frames of Middle Ages stucco work: M. Exner (Ed.): Stuck des frühen und hohen Mittelalters. Geschichte, Technologie, Konservierung. (ICOMOS Hefte des Deutschen Nationalkomitees Vol.19), München 1996.
