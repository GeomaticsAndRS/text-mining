  Developpement of a new geochemical tool : iron isotopes.  

Technical progress now allow the study of fractionations of transition metal isotopes in nature.  Among them iron is especially interesting as it is a redox element whose properties have been crucial to the evolution of atmosphere and biosphere since the early beginning of life. Its isotopic composition, registered in sediments, is a function of the sources from which it derives and of the processes it was submitted to. It should allow us to understand better these phenomena as the formation of BIF (banded iron formation) during the archean and proterozoic which remains debated or the evolution of metabolism. We are currently setting up this new analytical technique in ETHZ.
