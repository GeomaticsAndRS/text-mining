  A Self Consistent Particle-in-Cell Finite Element Time Domain Solver for Large Accelerator Structures 
This research project focuses on efficiently solving self-consistent Maxwell's equations in large and complex shaped accelerator structures of the first part of the PSIFEL/LEG1 project. Our prime goal is a quantitative and self-consistent modeling of the injector in the PSI-FEL/LEG project. 
This research project focuses on efficiently solving self-consistent Maxwell's equations in large and complex shaped accelerator structures primarily in the light of the first part of the PSIFEL/LEG1 project. Our prime goal is a quantitative and self-consistent modeling of the injector in the PSI-FEL/LEG project. A novel parallel multi-scale modeling code will be developed in collaboration with Prof. Peter Arbenz from the Institute of Computational Science (ETHZ), using recent developed knowledge on parallelization, numerical methods and accelerator modeling from previous projects. ParticleIn-Cell (PIC) methods combined with novel finite element discretization techniques and parallel implementation will enable us to build up the unique capabilities with respect to quantitative modeling, needed in order to predict with sufficient accuracy beam and field properties in the detailed design and optimization of the PSI-FEL/LEG project. Benchmarking and code comparison will be done in international collaboration with researchers from Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) and CERN.
