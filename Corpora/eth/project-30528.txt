  Strategy flexibility in algebraic problem solving under an individual difference perspective  
The ability to choose problem solving strategies flexibly and adaptively is important for successful problem solving. However, it is unclear how simple forms of problem solving practice affect flexibility. On the one hand, as demonstrated by the Einstellung effect and the Stroop effect, practice lea
