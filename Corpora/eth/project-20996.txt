  Pluripotency and Cellular Reprogramming - Epigenetic Regulation of Transdetermination in Drosophila Imaginal Discs 
The basic hypothesis is that transdetermination of Drosophila imaginal discs is initiated by JNK signaling as a wound response, which leads to PcG down regulation, which is a prerequisite to re-programming of cells.
