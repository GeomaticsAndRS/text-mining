  Folding and three-dimensional structure of the recombinant murine prion protein  

Mammalian prion diseases are believed to be caused by a single protein, the prion protein, which exists in two different conformations, the monomeric cellular form, and the infectious, oligomeric "scrapie form". We found that the recombinant carboxy-terminal domain of the mouse prion protein (residues 121-231) is an autonomous folding unit. In contrast with model predictions, its three-dimensional structure, which was solved in collaboration with the group of Prof. K. Wüthrich in our institute, contains a two-stranded beta-sheet and three alpha-helices. In collaboration with Prof. K. Wüthrich, we have also solved the three-dimensional solution structure of the complete recombinant cellular prion protein from the mouse, PrP(23-231). Its entire N-terminal segment 23-125 proved to be flexibly disordered in solution, while the C-terminal residues 126-231 adopt the same structure as in the isolated C-terminal domain PrP(121-231). As the segment 90-231 is protease-resistant in the oligomeric scrapie form PrPSc, we postulate that the minimal structural change that occurs during the conversion of the cellular prion protein to the scrapie form is that the segment 90-125 becomes structured or buried in PrPSc. We are currently investigating the role of point mutations linked with inherited human prion diseases on the stability and aggregation behaviour of PrP(23-231) and PrP(121-231). We are also investigating the role of a scrapie-like unfolding intermediate of the prion protein that is exclusively populated at acidic pH values and possibly constitutes a percursor form of PrPSc. Moreover, we have found that the C-terminal domain of the prion protein undergoes one of the fastest protein folding reactions known so far and folds without kinetic intermediates. This excludes kinetic folding intermediates as source of PrPSc.
