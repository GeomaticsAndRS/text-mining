  High Resolution Infrared Spectroscopy in Supersonic Jets 

 Expansion of gases in supersonic jets generates nonequilibrium conditions under which one can measure vapour spectra with very low effective vibrational and in particular rotational temperatures (of the order of 10 K and also below). This can be essential for the analysis and understanding of molecular spectra. We develop techniques of FTIR- and IR-laser supersonic jet spectroscopy. Applications include the spectra of chlorofluorocarbons and other molecules of importance for the earth's atmosphere, molecular clusters and others. For a recent review see M. Quack, Annu. Rev. Phys.
