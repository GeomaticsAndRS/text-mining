  ReMeDi  
The ReMeDi project addresses telediagnostics in clinical environments. A successful medical treatment depends on a timely and correct diagnosis. In the ReMeDi project we develop a multifuntional robotic device, which will allow performing a real remote physical and ultrasonographic (USG) examination 
The ReMeDi project addresses telediagnostics in clinical environments. A successful medical treatment depends on a timely and correct diagnosis. In the ReMeDi project we develop a multifuntional robotic device, which will allow performing a real remote physical and ultrasonographic (USG) examination. Working as a multidisciplinary consortium (physicians, human-robot interaction researchers such as psychologists and social scientists, and engineers), we want to enable remote examinations that come as close as possible to direct examinations and thereby follow the most natural and common medical techniques. Our goal is to make the ReMeDi robot user-friendly for physicians and acceptable to patients by enhancing (tele-)presence with intelligent autonomous features.
