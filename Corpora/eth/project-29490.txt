  Operational Potential of Ecosystem Research Applications (FP7-OPERAs)  
OPERAs explores whether, how and under what conditions the concepts of ecosystem services (ES) and natural capital (NC) can better move beyond the academic domain towards implementation in support of sustainable ecosystem management. 
One of the main aims of our Task 3.4 (institutional structure and governance systems, in collaboration with the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies) is to provide insights on governance arrangements of ecosystem services. Studies of governance in relation to ecosystem services and in the context of the OPERAs project include but also go beyond the traditional study of environmental policy. Particularly the study of social and cultural values requires a broader approach than a limited focus on environmental policy. Such values are often poorly represented in policies and may be expressed, for example, through social movements. Furthermore, science and governance arrangements interact in complex multi-level dialogues to formulate strategies and pathways aiming at sustainability. Such strategies are intimately and mutually related to scientific understandings, as well as to the political and economic context in which science is pursued. Policies are often not the results of a rational and logical reasoning underpinned by science, but the results of complex bargaining, influenced by numerous interests, many of which are in conflict with one another.
