  Step formation in steep mountain streams by blocking and self-organization of coarse grains in transport (STEPsoc)  
Research on cellular automaton modelling of the formation and collapse of steps in steep mountain streams supported by field data and flume analysis. In collaboration with  WSL and UBC Canada.
