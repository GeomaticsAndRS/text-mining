  Synthetic gene networks in mammalian cells  
The design and construction of synthetic gene circuits with complex spatiotemporal dynamics was pioneered in bacteria, but it took almost a decade until synthetic biologists were able to construct genetic circuits with complex spatiotemporal dynamics in mammalian cells. This review highlights [...
