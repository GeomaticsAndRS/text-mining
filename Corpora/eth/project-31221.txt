Dynamic changes of genomic and transciptomic tumor diversity during melanoma 
Cancer progression is a somatic evolutionary process, characterized by the accumulation of genetic alterations that result in perturbed signaling pathways and abnormal cellular phenotypes. Tumor progression, which is driven by these selectively advantageous mutations, ultimately leads to invasive carcinomas and metastases. Continuing tumor evolution implies that many subclones coexist in each individual tumor at any point in time. The dynamics of tumor progression and the genomic diversity of tumors are important factors for disease progression, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. We propose to characterize the dynamics of mutation accumulation in a mouse model of melanoma. Specifically, we will induce, in a highly specific manner, melanomas in BRAFactivated and PTEN-inactivated mice. Tumors are analyzed at five consecutive time points after induction. We will employ next-generation sequencing to assess the whole-exome tumor DNA and the transcriptome. Using deep-coverage, we will explore the genetic diversity of tumors. The exhaustive genomic analysis of timed samples will allow for a comprehensive characterization of the subsequent alterations driving tumorigenesis, for estimating dynamic features of melanogenesis, and for quantifying and interpreting intra-tumor heterogeneity. Hence, this study aims at generating important basic insights into the dynamics of genetic interactions in tumorigenesis that will impact diagnostics, prognostics, and treatment of melanoma.
