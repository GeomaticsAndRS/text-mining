  Genome sequencing of the ascomycetous root endophyte Phialocephala subalpina  
The genome of Phialocephala subalpina, the most abundant confer tree root endophyte, is sequenced and annotated.
Acephala applanata species comRoot endophytes belonging to the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. U plex (PAC) are among the most abundant fungal species in natural ecosystems. These endophytes can be found on all parts of the root system whereas mycorrhizal fungi are usually confined to primary, non-lignified roots. Thus, biomass of PAC in relation to the whole root system may be even higher than that of mycorrhizal fungi. Consequently the interactions of PAC with their hosts and with other microorganisms are assumed to be significant. However, ongoing projects studying the host-PAC interaction show that the colonization of spruce seedlings is associated with a reduced biomass accumulation of the hosts, and some PAC strains even show a pronounced pathogenic behaviour. This leads to the question, why these endophytes are so abundant in nature although for their hosts. Knowing the genome sequence of these endophytes will they cause Snetto-costs ¸ T set the basis for studying host-PAC interactions in more detail. Therefore, we propose a de novo genome sequencing of a carefully selected strain of Phialocephala subalpina, the most abundant PAC species in the Northern hemisphere. In addition, a semi-automated annotation of the genome sequence with the help of EST libraries and BLAST searches is planned.
