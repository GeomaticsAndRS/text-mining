  High Temperature phase transition in hexagonal manganites  
We investigate the para-to-ferroelectric phase transition in hexagonal manganites by optical second harmonic generation at temperatures higher than 1300 K. Our goal is to identify how the ferroelectric order emerges and to clarify the phase transition properties.
