  Local Order or Decomposition in Pt-Rh  

An open question concerning the bulk properties of Pt-Rh is whether the system orders or decomposes at low temperatures. This question is not yet definitely settled as interactions are small and kinetics are slow. While general phenomenological trends (of alloys where both elements are late transition metals) and the analogy with other Pt alloys favor decomposition, ab-initio electronic-structure calculations indicate the formation of several ordered structures. To clarify this question, the diffuse X-ray scattering of a Pt-47 at.% Rh single crystal was measured in the laboratory (using Mo K alpha radiation), at ID1 (ESRF, Grenoble, exploiting anomalous scattering close to the Rh K absorption edge to enhance the scattering contrast), and small-angle neutron scattering patterns were taken at SANS I (SINQ, Villigen PSI). A comparison of the diffuse maxima off the Bragg reflections and at the positions of the Bragg reflections indicates that the decomposing tendency is slightly dominant over the ordering tendency in the bulk. Near the surface, compositional variations have been observed. The near-surface microstructure is currently investigated using grazing-incidence diffraction (SLS, Villigen PSI).
