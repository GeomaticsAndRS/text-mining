  Study of Time Reversal Symmetry in Free Neutron Decay  

A dedicated experiment searching for time reversal violation induced by  scalar weak interactions is desirable to complement the precision determination of the tensor covariant in the experiment with polarized $^{8}. Neither scalar nor tensor terms are present in the standard theory. Much interest in the scalar interaction has been generated by the proliferation of fundamental spin-zero (scalar) particles which appear in many extensions of the Standard Model. A study of a few candidate weak decays has shown that an experiment with the simplest baryonic system, the neutron, is the most attractive. Neutron decay is the most fundamental semileptonic weak decay and it serves as a model for more complicated systems. Decay parameters of the free neutron have been studied extensively in the last half century. However, no experiment to determine the R-correlation, which provides the sole information on T-violating scalar couplings, has been performed up to now. Valuable information concerning the mass and coupling of the hypothetical scalar particles will be provided by such a direct measurement of the T-violating amplitude. Such an experiment is in preparation at the spallation source SINQ, a new facility which will come into operation at PSI in 1997.
