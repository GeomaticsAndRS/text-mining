  MODisc - Development of a novel tissue culture model for degenerative disc disease  
The aim of this project is to establish a novel degenerative disc disease model based on a bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue culture with artificial annulus fibrosus (AF). The model will include daily physiological loading, signs of degeneration and an inflammatory environment.
