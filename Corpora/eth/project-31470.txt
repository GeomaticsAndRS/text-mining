  Sustainable Water Infrastructure Planning  
Decision making support will be developed so that the long-term planning of water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure can be improved. The project will strive for a balance between economic costs, ecological aspects and social values. 
Goal is an improved planning procedure for sustainable water supply and wastewater infrastructure management that links into the existing Swiss governance structures. A special focus is given to dealing with limited data, the uncertainty of future developments, and ensuring high acceptance of the decision-making process by stakeholders. SWIP is based on three main pillars: (i) Quantitatively considering the goals of the involved stakeholders by the means of Multi-Criteria Decision analysis (MCDA); (ii) extrapolating the consequence of rehabilitation strategies into the future by providing novel deterioration models for sewer and water distribution networks and (iii) explicitly including all known uncertainties, including climate change and socio economic development, into the results. The approach was tested in one case study and showed some surprising results. The overall methodology is sound, but needs more practical experience and tweaking to be rolled out on a large scale.
