  Hydrotreating  

The removal of nitrogen from nitrogen-containing aromatics takes place via a complex  network of hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and N-elimination reaction steps. To investigate the catalytic sites at which these steps take place, the kinetics of the hydrodenitrogenation of model compounds such as pyridine, piperidine, quinoline, decahydroquinoline and aniline is studied at elevated temperature and pressure in plug flow reactors. Sulphided Ni-Mo and Co-Mo catalysts supported on Al$_{2}$_{3}$, SiO$_{2}$and carbon and promoted by phosphate are investigated. The formation of very small MoS2 crystallites, decorated by Ni or Co atoms, through impregnation of the support with aqueous solutions, drying, calcining and sulphidation is studied with solid state NMR, atomic force microscopy and extended X-ray absorption spectroscopic techniques.
