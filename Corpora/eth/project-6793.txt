  Atomistic Modeling of Solid Polymeric Systems  

 The goal of Atomistic Modeling of Polymeric Systems is to gain a better understanding of their behavior and their macroscopic properties with the help of microscopic, atomistically detailed models. Current research is focused on crystalline and amorphous structures and their properties: a typical amorphous-cell simulation considers a small volume within the bulk of the polymer; this volume is filled with polymer chains in which the full chemical detail is preserved in a way that satisfies certain statistical-mechanical requirements. Replicas of this elementary cell are assumed to fill three-dimensional space by periodic repetition (translation of the cell along the three spatial coordinates). In this way it is possible to obtain information about the macroscopic behavior of the polymer and to mimic the inherently amorphous character of many industrially important polymers. Crystalline polymers are treated in a straightforward, analogous way. The structures generated in this fashion can then be subjected to different mechanical tests in the computer, such as compression, extension or shearing. Alternatively, the spontaneous fluctuations in size and shape of the unit cell can be used for predictions. Several industrially relevant polymers are being simulated successfully with this novel technique.
