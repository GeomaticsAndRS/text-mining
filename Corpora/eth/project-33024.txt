  Asymptotic solution of the temperature field in stagnant lid convection simulations, effect of a pressure-dependent rheology  
We present a new analytical formulation of the internal temperature and the Nusselt number reached in numerical simulations of mantle convection, with pressure-dependent  viscosity. We derive a new formalism for Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheologies. Numerical results match the analytical prediction
A large set of numerical simulations of thermal convection is shown to fit a new version of the classical boundary layer theory. Temperature and pressure-dependent rheologies are considered in Newtonian and non-Newtonian situations in the stagnant lid regime. Particular attention is paid to the pressure-dependence of the rheology, which may be important in large super-Earths. A large activation volume is found to significantly decrease the internal temperature of the convecting region in basally heated domains. An analytical formulation of the internal temperature is predicted and confirmed numerically. In this new self-consistent formulation, it appears that the internal temperature depends on both lateral and vertical viscosity contrasts in the convecting region, below the stagnant lid. Though the new best-fitting coefficients of the scalings of Nusselt number are quantitatively slightly different than what is prescribed by classical formulation, their expression is unchanged. Since several mechanisms, like partial melting or phase transitions, are considered to generate vertical viscosity jumps, this study introduces a new powerful tool for the investigation of the thermal evolution of convecting bodies. This result is in very good agreement with the previously proposed boundary layer theory developments and allows to self-consistently take into account the pressuredependence of the rheology.
