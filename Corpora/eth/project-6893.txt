  Quantum Chemical Calculation and Characterization of Potential Hypersurfaces for Vibrational- and Reaction Dynamics of Polyatomic Molecules  

Using numerically intensive computations accurate calculations of potential hypersurfaces of polyatomic molecules are carried out using ab initio SCF-CI, MR-CI and related quantum chemical techniques. The goal of these computations is to characterize the potentials for vibrational dynamics, spectroscopy, and chemical reactions of polyatomic molecules. Part of these computations are carried out in relation to the C4 project (Competence Center in Computational Chemistry). For recent papers see T.K. Ha, M. Lewerenz, R. Marquardt and M. Quack, J.
