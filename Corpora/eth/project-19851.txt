  Practical aspects of regression analysis  
Regression methods play a central role in applied statistics. Computer programs provide numerical output and graphics for residual analysis. Several aspects of these results leave room for improvements that render data analysis more efficient.
Aspects of program outputs to be improved are: ­ Numerical output: Show all the information needed to assess the impact of the explanatory variables in one summary. ­ Residual analysis: Show all useful residual plots with a single call to the plot function. ­ Residuals for some generalized linear models: Definition of residuals for ordered regression, multinomial regression and censored response variables. ­ Model selection: Useful displays The more general theme is to determine strategies to develop regression models for various uses of regression. In practice, it is important that the steps used for such strategies are implemented in a way which allows for efficient interactions with the user.
