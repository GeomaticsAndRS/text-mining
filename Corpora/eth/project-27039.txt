  Magnetoelectric correlations in Co3TeO6  
Co3TeO6 is investigated by optical second harmonic generation to study the pronounced magnetoelectric correlations in this compound.
Co3TeO6 belongs to the group of so-called joint-order-parameter multiferroics where a ferroelectric order is induced by a magnetic ordering. Applying optical second harmonic we were able to undoubtedly verify the multiferroic properties of Co3TeO6. Furthermore, we applied second harmonic generation to determine the magnetic/electric field - temperature phase diagram, the magnetic domain topography and the magnetoelectric correlations in Co3TeO6. More specifically, we defined three main goals for this project: (i)proof of magnetoelectric switching of the ferroelectric polarization and the magnetization in external magnetic and electric fields, (ii)investigating the behavior of the magnetic domain structure in external magnetic and electric fields, and (iii) development of theoretical model explaining the experimental results based on Landau theory.
