  The role of Bradyrhizobium japonicum extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor EcfG in formation of an effective symbiosis  
Goals of this project are (i) the development of experimental tools to study the development of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-legume symbiosis and (ii) the identification and functional analysis of sigma factor EcfG-dependent genes that are needed for the formation of a functional symbiosis.
