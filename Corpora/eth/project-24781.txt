  Synthesis of P-functionlalized Metal-Organic Frameworks  
The production of anchoring group in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential to post-functionalize these materials with transition metals. P-functionalized MOFs are still not known in the literature although phosphorous is one of the most employed donor atom for catalysis by metal complexes. 
The production of anchoring group in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential to post-functionalize these materials with transition metals. P-functionalized MOFs are still not known in the literature although phosphorus is one of the most employed donor atom for catalysis by metal complexes. The aim of this project is to produce MOFs with free phosphine groups with similar geometry to that encountered in known metal-oganic frameworks, such as MOF-5, MOF-177, and UMCM-1, and to use them as support for transition metal complexes.
