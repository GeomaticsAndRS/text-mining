  Calculus of Variations  

 Fundamental laws in physics often can be derived from variational principles. Similarly, in differential geometry, Riemannian manifolds enjoying special properties can be characterized variationally. The Calculus of Variations has proven to be both a means of understanding the laws of nature as well as a universal tool for finding qualitative properties of solutions. Current research in this field includes a project, carried out with Paul Harpes, aimed at understanding the qualitative behaviour of minimizers of the Ginzburg-Landau model, continuing previous research by Bethuel-Brezis-Hélein, Bethuel-Riviere, Lin, and Hong-Jost-Struwe. Another project, jointly with Ambrosetti (Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa), is directed at finding generalized periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems with singular potentials. Finally, we investigate stability and uniqueness properties of harmonic maps, which may be regarded as a model problem also for questions relating to well-posedness of certain geometric evolution problems.
