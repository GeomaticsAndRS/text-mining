  Southern Ocean stratification and circulation response to changing freshwater fluxes during cold and warm climates  
We study the impact of changing freshwater fluxes on the Southern Ocean stratification and circulation in past, present and future climates. Southern Ocean dynamics play a critical role for long-term changes of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and thus for feedbacks with the global climate.
