  Composition of dissolved organic matter and its interaction with metals and ultraviolet radiationin river-ocean systems: impact on the microbial food web (Acronym of the project: COMET) 

 While the input of inorganic nutrients, particularly phosphorus, into European coastal waters declined over the last few years, the input of metals still increases. This input of metals is largely mediated via major rivers. During their riverine transport, metals undergo complex interactions with dissolved, colloidal and particulate organic matter that affect their chemical speciation and thus their bioavailability, toxicity, and transport. These interactions are then modified in the estuary and river plume because of increasing ionic strength. Redox-active metals (e.g., iron, copper) undergo light-induced reduction, either by reaction with superoxide (O$^{.-}_{2}$) or through photolysis of metal complexes, resulting in an increase of their bioavailability. Metals also play an important role in catalyzing the photooxidation of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which leads to either an increase or a decrease of DOM bioavailability. Furthermore, photooxidation of DOM, and light-induced redox cycling of metals yield reactive oxygen species (e.g. hydroxyl radicals, HO$^{.}$). These can have deleterious impact on the activity of the individual components (phyto- and bacterioplankton) of the microbial loop. Hence, solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may greatly affect the productivity of aquatic ecosystems as well as the fate of terrestrial organic carbon. In this project, the effects of UVR on metal and DOM cycling are studied at 4 study sites: Rhine River, Rhine estuary, coastal North Sea, and Skagerrak.
