  Investigations of High Temperature Superconductors  
Neutron scattering is employed to investigate both the magnetic excitations and the Abrikosov phase diagram of high-temperature supercondcutors. The results are then confronted to both theroetical and experimental results obtained form other probe like, for example, ARPES, tunneling or transport.
