  The role of genetic diversity and interaction of fungal symbionts in PAC-woody-plant systems. 
PAC (Philaocephala fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata species complex) are  dominat root endophytes in forest ecosystems. We study virulence, host preference and interactions of different PAC species in a multipartite experimental system at different temperatures. The project is part of GEDIHAP.
The role of genetic diversity and interaction of fungal symbionts in PAC-woody-plant systems. PAC (ascomycetes in the Philaocephala fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata species complex) are ubiquitous fungal colonizers of plant roots in temperate and boreal ecosystems of the Northern hemisphere and are supposed to be powerful ecological forces shaping the structure and dynamics of woody plant communities. In this project, which is part of GEDIHAP ( http://www.cces.ethz.ch/projects/feh/gediha virulence, host preference and interactions of different PAC species are tested in a multipartite experimental system at different temperatures. Several woody hosts (e.g. Picea abies, Betula pendula) are inoculated with representative strains of various PAC-species with different virulence and temperature requirements. The biomass of the host plants will be measured and the fungal colonization of plant tissues by individual strains will be quantified by molecular techniques. The project will provide insights into effects of root endophyte communities on host plants and on the interaction between closely related PAC taxa in a changing environment.
