  Dynamic 3D Shapes  
This project investigates efficient representations and algorithms for dynamic 3D shapes, i.e., digital 3D objects that undergo frequent changes of shape or appearance. 
This project focuses on efficient representations and algorithms for dynamic 3D shapes, i.e., 3D objects that undergo frequent changes of shape or appearance. Dynamic shapes play an important role in geometric modeling and computer animation, and pose interesting challenges in terms of model representation, simulation, interaction, and rendering. Sample-based surface and volume representations have proven to be particularly suitable for dynamic shapes, allowing for efficient dynamic restructuring during editing and animation.
