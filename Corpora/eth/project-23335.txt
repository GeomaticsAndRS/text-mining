  Nuclear physics from strong coupling lattice QCD  
We investigate numerically the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD), on a lattice in the limit of infinitely strong coupling. We focus on the nuclear physics arising from QCD and on the phases of the theory as a function of temperature, density and quark masses. 
Considerable computational resources worldwide are devoted to studying nuclear physics from first principles, i.e., as it emerges from the theory of strong interactions (QCD). The Monte Carlo methods employed rely on the probabilistic interpretation of the measure that characterizes the partition function of QCD at finite density and temperature. In the presence of baryons (the composite fermions of QCD) the positivity of the measure is lost, making a direct probabilistic interpretation impossible and increasing the computational cost immensely. For lattice QCD at infinite gauge coupling, we can bypass the conventional numerical approach and reformulate our system directly in terms of mesons (composite bosons) and baryons. This enables us to employ rather recent algorithmic techniques (worm algorithm) to successfully address the long-standing goal of studying nuclear physics, i.e., the properties of nuclear matter and the nucleon-nucleon potential in this limiting regime of QCD. In addition, we can map the whole phase diagram of strong coupling QCD (for variable temperature and density) in the limit of vanishing quark mass and its evolution as the quark mass is increased. Both aspects of our project, first-principles nuclear physics and the QCD phase diagram, are the focus of current large-scale theoretical and experimental (eg. LHC at CERN) research efforts worldwide.
