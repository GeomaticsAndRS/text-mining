  Aggregation stability of amyloidogenic proteins and peptides 
The mechanism and the kinetics of protein and peptide aggregation invol-  ved both in biological systems and in biotechnology industry is investigated from a biophysical point of view. An approach based on experimental characterization and model activity is considered.
