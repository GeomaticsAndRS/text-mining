  Modelling the Carbon-dynamics in Forest Ecosystems under the Influence of ClimaticChange  

 The forest gap-model ForClim (see project ForClimSense) provides a basis to simulate the elemental fluxes of C and N. Given the importance of carbon, both in the context of the global carbon cycle and as a key element in ecosystem functioning via coupling with nutrients, ForClim is presently refined to include the major fluxes driving the C-cycle. This applies to the soil-borne processes and soil organic carbon in particular which have been recognized as major sources and pools within forests. The modeling of the soil carbon submodel includes structural and parametric sensitivity analysis; after the integration of the soil submodel we will validate ForClim and apply it in forests of the boreal and temperate zones.
