  The Zwicky Prize Fellowship Program  
Four independent researchers are studying different aspects of theoretical astrophysics under the auspices of the ETH Zwicky Prize Fellowship program in (a) extragalactic  magnetic fields; (b) massive star-formation; (c) cosmology with large scale redshift surveys; (d) theoretical cosmology
At present, four young theoretical astrophysicists carry out independent research of their own choosing under the auspices of the Zwicky Fellowship Program. All are concerned in one way or another with the development of structure in the Universe, from the largest scales down to the formation of individual massive stars. Particular areas of interest include (a) the interpretation of very large redshift surveys; (b) hydrodynamic simulations of massive clusters and the origin of extragalactic magentic fields and of high energy cosmic rays; (c) the formation of massive stars in our own Galaxy and in the early Universe; (d) general theoretical cosmology including problems in radiative transfer in the early Universe.
