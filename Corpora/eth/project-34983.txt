  Long-term Resistance of Gradient Anchorage for Prestressed CFRP Strips in Structural Concrete Retrofitting  
The goal of this project is to investigate the influence 1) of carbonation,  2) of freeze-thaw cycles as well as 3) of a combination of elevated temperature and high relative humidity on the long-term gradient anchorage resistance for Prestressed Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strips.
