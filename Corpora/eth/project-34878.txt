  Hybrid platinum nanocatalyst for the hydrogenation of functionalized nitroaromatics: from ensemble design to flow chemistry  
This project investigates the structure and performance of ligand-modified platinum catalysts in the continuous-flow three-phase hydrogenation of nitroaromatic compounds. 
A new generation of commercially available platinum-based catalysts prepared via a reductiondeposition method has shown outstanding performance for the chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes to anilines. We have assessed the complex structure of this hybrid catalyst using in depth characterization techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It comprises uniform Pt nanoparticles capped with hexadecyl(2-hydroxyethyl)dimethylammonium dihydrogenphosphate (HHDMA) surfactant and deposited on carbon. The hydrogenation of a wide variety of functionalized nitroaromatics, conducted in a three-phase continuous-flow micro-reactor, reveals the outstanding activity and chemoselectivity of the hybrid nanocatalyst outperforming the traditional Pt-Pb/CaCO3. A full mechanistic analysis by DFT revealed the variation in the adsorption modes of target reactants and products. This molecular-level understanding was complemented by systematic catalytic tests enabling the derivation of a micro-kinetic model.
