  ECHO 24, ETH CHannel sOunder @ 24 GHz  

The experimental assessment of the wave propagation properties will be of great importance  for the design and performance evaluation of future broadband communication systems. Therefore, a mobile broadband measuring system called ECHO 24 has been developed for indoor radio channel measurements in the ISM (Industrial Scientific Medical) band at 24 GHz. ECHO 24 employs a novel fiberoptic synchronization concept, achieves a 1 ns path delay resolution and allows the measurement of complex channel impulse responses with Doppler frequencies < 200 kHz based on a correlation method. Moreover, a virtual 3D antenna array together with an appropriate signal processing scheme yields the angle of arrival of the impinging waves at the receiver site. Based on the channel measurements carried out with ECHO 24 the performance of wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems operating at 24 GHz is investigated. With the OFDM modulation scheme cost-efficient systems shall be realized, which support large data rates with sufficient robustness to radio channel impairments like multipath spread. Therefore, OFDM based systems have been standardized in Europe, USA and Japan at a carrier frequency of 5 GHz. The simulated bit error rates of theses systems in real indoor environments are compared to analytically derived bit error probabilities. Although these investigations refer to OFDM systems, they can easily be adapted to other broadband wireless communications systems.
