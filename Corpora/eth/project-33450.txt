  Voluntary corporate climate initiatives and regulatory loom: Batten down the hatches  
We study whether firms with memberships in two well-known distinct US voluntary environmental programs to curb carbon emission were rewarded by the stock market when the likelihood of federal legislation targeting carbon emissions suddenly increased. 
In 2009 the Waxman-Markey Bill surprisingly passed the US House of Representatives and brought the US economy on the brink of a nationwide CO2 emission trading system. We use this event to study whether firms with memberships in two well-known distinct US voluntary environmental programs to curb carbon emission, the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and the Climate Leaders (CL), were rewarded by the stock market when the likelihood of federal legislation targeting carbon emissions suddenly increased. Our results suggest that only membership in the CCX program was considered beneficial. However, a substantial part of the observed market reaction for both programs consisted of industry-wide effects. Our findings shed light on investorsS expectations of climate change policies and their value perception of voluntary carbon reduction programs.
