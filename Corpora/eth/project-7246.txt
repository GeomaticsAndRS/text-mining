  PESCA: Programming languages made Easy to Specify, Compose and Apply  

 The PESCA-project aims to provide a system for specification of programming languages which is easy to use and easy to understand. Programming language specifications are split into independent units ~ (http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/montages/ Montages\rh). In conventional (compiler construction) tools, a language specification is given in terms of compiler phases: scanning, parsing, optimizations, code generation. Changes to the specification of a single language construct affect several phases and thus several specification files. The Montage approach avoids this problem by giving a complete specification for a language construct from syntax to static and dynamic semantics. Changes are therefore kept local. We employ component oriented programming techniques for the construction of tools which support the Montage approach. A main focus of our investications are domain specific languages (DSL). Such a DSL is typically taylored to cover the needs for controlling a specific embedded system. Reusability and modularity of the specifications are important to avoid expensive and time-consuming development phases.
