  Modular Converters with Parallel Connected Subunits  

Parallel converters are composed of several subunits. A problem with these  converters is that each subunit does not deliver the same current. This problem can be solved with a method developed at the Laboratory of Electrical Engineering Design called current distribution control. In this project, a theoretical study of parallel converters with current distribution control has been conducted. Initially, the transfer function of the current distribution control was determined, and it's frequency response analysed. The frequency response analysis studied the influence of the main parameters on the control system. The bandwidth of the system was examined, and certain specifications were defined based on the allowed output current ripple in the subunits due to the control method. Next, the actual implementation of the current distribution control was designed. The optimal operating range of the controller and the optimal inductance for the connecting coils between the subunits were considered in the design process. An attempt at defining design laws for the control unit was made as well. Lastly, the possible effects of unbalanced current distribution on the converter in case of current distribution control failure were studied as well. At the beginning of 1994, a three-phase parallel converter, consisting of three parallel-connected subunits, was tested for the first time with full power, and the current distribution control operated correctly. Recently, the frequency response of the current distribution control system and the closed-loop frequency response of the entire system were measured. The results of the measurement showed good correlation with the theory.
