  Oxygen measurements based on new ruthenium(II) complexes 

 Most oxygen sensors which are used today determine oxygen by electrochemical (Clark electrodes) or optical methods (quenching of a dye's luminescence). Clark electrodes have found widespread industrial use but do not provide a universal solution, especially for small probes. Luminescence-based sensors incorporate an oxygen-selective dye which is embedded within a membrane which provides selectivity. Sensor performance doesn't depend on sensor dimensions. The use of organic Ru(II) complexes, which are popular oxygen sensor dyes owing to their high-quantum yield luminescence, high selectivity and good photostability, were proposed. Commonly, commercially available chemicals like bipyridyl derivatives, phenanthroline or 4,7-diphenyl-phenanthroline Ru(II) complexes are used. At CCS, tailor-made Ru(II) complexes such as tris(4,7-bis(n-alkyldiphenyl)-1,10-phenanthro-line)-ruthenium(II) complexes with n = 3, 6, and 8 (ETH$^{T}$3001 to 3003) were synthesized. Those compounds are more lipophilic than what has been used so far. Therefore specific characteristics as e.g. the sensor stability are improved by providing less hydrophilic complexes which are not washed out by aqueos samples. The apolarity and lipophilicity of the complexes broadens the range of possible matrices, where the compounds may be dissolved in, and hence the flexibility for tuning of membranes to biocompatibility and fiber optics. Since excitation and emission of the complexes are within the visible, no expensive UV equipment is needed. The rather long life time in the \gms-range facilitates a life time measurement which could provide a calibration-free oxygen sensor.
