  Strain-history dependence of entangled athermal fibre networks in biological and bio-inspired materials 
The mechanical behavior of athermal entangled networks, as they are formed by fibres in many biological and bio-inspired materials, typically depends on the history of  deformation. Constitutitive models are developed to account for this characteristic and to simulate the behavior of these materials.
