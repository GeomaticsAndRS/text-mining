  Systems-level understanding of the metabolism of Ras-driven tumors  plastic to 3D to xenografts to tumors across growth conditions U  
Activating mutations in Ras are found in 25% of all tumors. Ras mutant tumors have poor prognosis and a dearth of effective treatment options. Thus, drugs that are effective in Ras mutant tumors are a critical clinical need. Keywords: Oncology, Metabolomics, In vitro/in vivo cancer models.
