The overall layout of the project is to gather information that will contribute to understand how forests are perceived by a local population dwelling amidst forests or in a rural setting. Furthermore it aims to provide a general ap-proach that acknowledges that every fabric of socio-cultural life of forest dwellers is in-terwoven with forests and their management in order to facilitate their sustainable management and that of other scarce renewable natural resources.
