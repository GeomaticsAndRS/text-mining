  Identification of traits important for phyllosphere colonization  
Aerial plant surfaces are colonized by diverse bacteria such as the ubiquitously found Methylobacterium spp. We identify and characterize proteins that are specifically synthesized during phyllosphere colonization and analyse their importance in this habitat.
