  NMR Studies of Heavy-Electron Metals: CeAl3 and Ce3 Al11  

The results of extensive measurements of the temperature dependence of NMR spectra and  the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate on CeAl$_{3}$have shown that below 3 K the ground state of this heavy-electron metal consists of two coexisting very different magnetic phases. One of these phases gradually develops as the temperature lowers and is characterised by a dramatic slowing down of the spin fluctuations associated with the 4f electrons. This leads to the development of very small magnetic moments. In our model, the ground state of CeAl$_{3}$, may be pictured as split up into small domains of the order of 20 to 50 \aA of a magnetically correlated phase within a paramagnetic matrix. Below 3 K, the susceptibility $\gc_{i}(\gw,q)$inside a given domain, gradually develops a maximum at high frequencies and \!= 0$in the basal plane. Another heavy-electron metal that is subject of our NMR studies is Ce$_{3}$_{11}$. In this material a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state occurs at 6.3 K and a second phase transition to an antiferromagnetic state at 3.3 K. Our results indicate that the application of external magnetic fields of the order of a few kG destroys the antiferromagnetic state in favour of the ferromagnetic state. The obtained phase boundary T$_N$(H) has an almost linear-in-H functional form with roughly \gDT$_N$/\gDH = -10 K/T, a rather unusual dependence if compared with conventional antiferromagnets. The energy difference between the antiferromagnetic and the ferromagnetic state is very small at all temperatures. This is evident when one compares the decrease of T$_N$with field with the corresponding increase of T$_C$with field. The latter we found to be about 20 times smaller than the former, i.e., ~ $\gD$_C$/$\gD0.5K/T, a value which is much closer to expectations for the ordering phenomena of this type of compound.
