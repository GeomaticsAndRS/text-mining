  Structure and Dynamics of Silk Proteins  
The design principles of spider dragline silk, natureSs high-performance  fiber, are still largely unknown, in particular for the non-crystalline glycine-rich domains, that form the bulk of the material. We are applying multidimensional NMR methods for structural characterization in the dragline as w
