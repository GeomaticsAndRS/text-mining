  Comparative Multivariate Data Visualization  

 Many different graphical methods have been developed with the goal to reveal structure in multivariate data sets. A given display's effectiveness to visualize information, however, can differ substantially from one data set to another because each method favors certain characteristics of the data. We develop visualization software to investigate the potential ofdifferent graphical methods when they are linked with each other. The possibility to dynamically select arbitrary subsets from a lower-dimensional region of a display provides the basis to examine relationships in the data that become visible only when several variables can be examined simultaneously. In this way, a data set's characteristics across many dimensions can be examined with a single display by visually comparing different views of selected parts of the same data set. We expand on this methodology by allowing visual comparisons of a given data set across different graphical displays which are connected operationally. In other words, directly manipulating the graphical elements in one of the displays will correspondingly affect the visual appearance of the data in all other displays connected with it.
