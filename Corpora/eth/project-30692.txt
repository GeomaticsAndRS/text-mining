  Resilience of electric power supply network under natural hazards  
This project investigates the resilience of the electric power grid infrastructure exposed to natural hazard by investigation the vulnerability and recoverability of its principal components: the transmission systems, the substations (switches and the transformers), and the  power generation stations
