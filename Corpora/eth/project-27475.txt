  The production of artificial cells using microfluidic  

The aim of this project is to produce a microfluidic platform for the production and study of artificial cells. Microfluidic devices will be designed and fabricated to produce liposomes encapsulating both DNA transcription and translation reactions. There will be two main outcomes from this project. First, a device capable of performing an entire liposome preparation and encapsulation process by emulsion transfer of lipid-stabilised microdroplets will be demonstrated. Second, studies will demonstrate that liposomes are a suitable chassis for use in synthetic biology, and can be used to study cellular systems in isolation from each other and the wider intracellular environment. It is expected that studies will show that liposome-based artificial cells can be an invaluable tool for reducing the complexity found in real living cells, and will open new possibilities in the investigation of the interactions between cellular subsystems.
