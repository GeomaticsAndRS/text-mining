  Spin Orbit Torque memory for cache Multicore processor applications (SPOT) 
The goal of the project is to develop a new class of power-efficient and scalable non-volatile cache memory based on the recent discovery of current-induced magnetization switching due to spin-orbit torques in ultrathin ferromagnetic layers.
