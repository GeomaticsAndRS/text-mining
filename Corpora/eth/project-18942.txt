We examine how wages, unemployment and market regulations depend on the extent to which economic agents, voters and parties take general equilibrium effects into account. In particular, we are concerned about the following issues: How does non-awareness of general equilibrium feedback effects impact on wage negotiations between unions and employer associations? How does non-awareness of general equilibrium feedback effects impact on voting behavior regarding industry regulations? Can we neglect general equilibrium effects in the product market regulations? How do product market reforms and uneven technological change affect unemployment?
