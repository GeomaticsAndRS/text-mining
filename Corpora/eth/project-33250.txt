  Process design and optimization of conventional metal spinning processes using the finite element method  
Conventional metal spinning is an ISF process which typically involves the manufacturing of axis-symmetric parts. FEA of the process can substantially help discovering  systematic methodologies for optimal parameter determination and thus enable the full automation of the processs using CNC machines.
