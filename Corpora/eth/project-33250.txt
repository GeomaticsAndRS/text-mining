  Process design and optimization of conventional metal spinning processes using the finite element method  
Conventional metal spinning is an ISF process which typically involves the manufacturing of axis-symmetric parts. FEA of the process can substantially help discovering  systematic methodologies for optimal parameter determination and thus enable the full automation of the processs using CNC machines.
Conventional sheet metal spinning is an incremental forming process which typically involves the cost-effective and high-quality manufacturing of seamless, axis-symmetric and hollow parts. The process is usually executed by highly skilled and experienced personnel who is able of optimizing the process parameters during production. Numerical simulation of the process can substantially help discovering systematic methodologies for optimal parameter determination and thus enable the full automation of the process using CNC machines.
