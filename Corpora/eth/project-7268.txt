  Layout and Performance of Converters with Parallel Switching Devices  

Control methods were developed to optimize the parallel operation of power  semiconductor devices. The main goal was to control the current distribution in all parallel devices at every operating point without load-side components. Therefore, the control loop can be closed within the gate drive. The project was divided into two sections examining the behaviour of MCTs and IGBTs. MCTs: The different parameters of the ABB-MCT were measured to determine if the current distribution could be controlled in a parallel-connected arrangement. A combination of gate voltage control and timing of the turn-on instant proved successful. This made it possible to reach a homogenous current distribution in spite of production inhomogeneities of the MCTs. A comparison with Harris-MCTs was completed as well. It showed that the Harris-MCT on-state voltage could not be changed by the gatevoltage signal. IGBTs: Through active gate-controlled current balancing, the current is equally distributed between the modules at all time. With this novel method, it is possible to reduce the derating of the converter, without requiring bulky components on the load side. Investigations are being done to verify the influence of nonideal thermal coupling, tolerances of the IGBT, the gate drive and additional thermal parameters on the control method. An experimental setup which allows up to four high power semiconductor devices to be connected in parallel is being used to verify the theoretical results.
