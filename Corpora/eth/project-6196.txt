  Numerical Simulation of the Behaviour of Structural Systems in the Case of Fire  

 The aim of the project resulting from a cooperation with Prof. M. Fontana is the computer simulation of the temperature distribution in structural systems in the case of fire and their mechanical behaviour under increased temperatures. Continuous beams with a constant cross-section are loaded both mechanically and by an increasing temperature. The cross-section consists of any number of rectangular elements. Composite sections can be specified by defining dowel characteristics. When computing the temperature distribution of the system a three-dimensional model is used, while all mechanical computations are based on a two dimensional model. The determination of the temperature distribution results from a nonlinear instationary computation. At the end of each time step a linear mechanical analysis is performed (uncoupled with the heat problem) which is based on beam theory using a specially developed ,double beam"-element considering the dowel's influence.
