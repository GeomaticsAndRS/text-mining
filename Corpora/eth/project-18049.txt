  BigLink: Biosphere-Geosphere interactions: Linking climate change, weathering, soil formation and ecosystem evolution  
The project cluster is part of the CCES Education& Research Unit CLENCH (Climate & Environmental Change). It aims at a better understanding of the processes driving soil and ecosystem development and will focus on initial weathering in previously glaciated mountain areas.
