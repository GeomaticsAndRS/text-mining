  Nanhua sediment bypass tunnel  
A new sediment bypass tunnel (SBT) is planned to counteract high sedimentation rates in the Nanhua reservoir in Southern Taiwan. Sinotech Engineering Consultants in  charge of the execution planning contracted VAW, ETH Zurich, to elaborate an expertise on the design of the Nanhua SBT.
The Nanhua Reservoir (Graphic 1) in Southern Taiwan, operated by the Taiwan Water Corporation, is subjected to high reservoir sedimentation. The owner decided to build a sediment bypass tunnel (SBT) to counteract this problem. The basic design stage is completed. Sinotech Engineering Consultants Ltd. (Sinotech) is in charge of the execution planning. Construction will be conducted by RSEA Engineering Corporation, and steel hydraulics will be designed by Nan Dao Engineering Corporation. Sinotech contracted the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology (VAW) of ETH Zurich, Switzerland, to elaborate an expertise on the design of the Nanhua SBT planned. During a site visit in Taiwan from 20th to 27th July 2014 the project was presented, and the reservoir as well as hydraulic model tests conducted at Tainan Hydraulics Laboratory of National Cheng Kung University were visited. Nine issues were addressed by Sinotech to be treated by VAW in the scope of this project. In the frame of another site visit the expertise report and its implicationsd on the final layout will be discussed.
