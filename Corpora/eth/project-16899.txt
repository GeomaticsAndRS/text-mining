  Knowledge Based Dynamic Landscape Analysis and Simulation for Alpine Environments 
Based on contributions from the disciplines of landscape visualizati-  on/virtual reality, modeling theory/theoretical systems ecology, and geographic information science, a system is designed and developed to jointly model, analyze and visualize landscape dynamics at various scales
Modeling landscape evolution can be compared to a journey through time and space, involving different speeds and scales as well as varying thematic depth. When dealing with the complex mountainous topography and environment of the Alps we should in fact be able to freely take a ´ Sbird's eye or a worm's-eye viewS, possibly at the same time, to truly understand the processes we investigate. We lack, however, the methods and instruments to do this by a cross-scale and hence ´ Scross-modelS approach in real time and to the benefit of the processes we want to understand. Thus, based on contributions from the disciplines of landscape visualization/virtual reality, modeling theory/theoretical systems ecology, and geographic information science, a prototype system is designed and developed to jointly model, analyze and visualize landscape dynamics at various scales together with the processes triggering or forcing the changes. Further, the IPODLAS system will have to meet the needs of researchers, decision-makers and laymen alike.
