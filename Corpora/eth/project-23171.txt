  Quantum phase transitions and scaling in low-dimensional and frustrated spin systems. 
Neutron scattering, muon spin rotation spectroscopy and bulk methods are used to experimentally investigate quantum critical phenomena in disordered, low-dimensional and geometrically frustrated spin systems. Particular attention is given to quantum phase transitions induced by magnetic fields.
