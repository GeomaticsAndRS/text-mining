  Effect of ceria morphology on oxygen storage properties  
Nanostructured ceria materials show different and advantageous properties compared to microsized or bulk-like ceria structures. But, the associated structural, chemical, and electronic changes in CeO2 at low dimensions are still far from clear. Using temperature programmed reduction (TPR), having ..
