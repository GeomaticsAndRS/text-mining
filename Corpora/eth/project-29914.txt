  Geotechnical index for the evaluation of quartz dust exposure potential  
In this research project it is tried to find an statistically sound relation between typical geotechnical rock parameteres (e.g. CAI, LCPC and UCS) determined in laboratory tests and the quartz dust potential of rock. 
This research project investigates statistical relationships between typical geotechnical rock parameteres (e.g. CAI, LCPC and UCS) determined in laboratory tests and the quartz dust potential of rock in underground excavations. The core of this research is a newly developed laboratory test procedure for the determination of quatz dust potential of different rock types in underground excavations, which is based on the LCPC test. In this "modified LCPC test" the rock dust, which is produced during the test, is collected and analyzed for its amount, grain size distribution and mineral (quartz) content. This allows to quantify the amount of released quartz dust und thereby gives an objective measure for the quartz dust potential of the analysed rock in underground excavations. Based on the test results of this "modified LCPC test" from a large series of rock samples, we investigate which geotechnical parameter or which combination of parameters relates best to the quartz dust potential. For this parameter / parameter combination then a classification of quarz dust potential is developed (low / medium / high). This classification will be tested on real case studys from underground excavation sites, where high quarz dust concentrations had been observed in the past and if necessary is adapted / corrected. Finally, based on the results of this research project, a guideline will be developed on how to use the new procedure during the planning phase of underground excavations.
