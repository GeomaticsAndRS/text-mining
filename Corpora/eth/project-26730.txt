  Combined Approaches for LCM Processes  
The research investigates novel approaches, considering combination of experimental and numerical methods, to monitor LCM processes and provide information about  the quality of composite parts. The purpose is to contribute to improve efficiency, robustness and reliability of composite flow process
During recent years promising results have been achieved in both flow-front monitoring systems and process optimization tools; however, a combined approach, concurrently considering virtual modeling and real flow monitoring, is so far only considering predefined scenarios. A general approach taking full advantage from information delivered by sensing network system is still missing; the research aims to contribute to fill this gap. In particular, under investigation are approaches to extract useful information from the ongoing injection, with the purpose of detecting the flow front advancement and to correlate sensor information to quality problems caused by variations in the permeability distribution, race-tracking, and so on. Key research aspects include: T ¸ Realistic assessment of permeability variations, including new methods to measure preform permeability. T ¸ Development and characterization of appropriate sensors. T ¸ Investigation of methodologies for flow monitoring combining experimental data with smart numerical codes. T ¸ Optimization of number, type and placement of sensors. T ¸ Interpretation of sensor data and correlation to laminate quality issues (e.g. wash-out).
