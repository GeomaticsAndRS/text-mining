  Direct Re-use of Waste Heat from Liquid-Cooled Supercomputers: Towards Low Power, High Performance, Zero-Emission Computing and Datacenters 
A liquid-cooled supercomputer will be connected to the ETH heating system to re-use the waste heat in order to reduce carbon emissions. The analysis includes modelling  of the heat sink and exergy analysis for optimisation purposes.
The increase in transistor density of microprocessors involves high thermal loads, requiring enhanced cooling. As a part of this project a liquid-cooled supercomputer will be installed at ETH where its performance will be analysed/optimised. The system will be connected to the ETH heating system to re-use the waste heat in order to reduce carbon emissions. The analysis includes modelling of the heat sink and exergy analysis for optimisation purposes.
