  Information Concepts - Design and Implementation  

Information needed for business activities is nowadays typically provided  with information systems, which often were developed with a strong focus on the available computer technology. During their development process different methods for data and application design are used more or less successfully. Different project owners with individual project goals and project teams only focusing on these goals may cause poorly coordinated projects. The environment and business development are therefore analysed not profound enough and don't get appropriate attention within design decisions. General strategic questions remain open, are analysed redundantly and inconsistently, or are answered by the project team deliberately. This lack of coordination results in problems in particular when information systems have to be redesigned. Analyzing different projects concerning their business value makes visible, that quite often important management data for the IT project management is missing. And the available data often is not comparable, so synergies within a project portfolio cannot be used. The goal of this project is to improve the internal and external information supply of a company by considering the internal and external enterprise environment more systematically, i.e. on the conceptual level. This is done based on the fact, that a better information supply leads to better business results. An improvement of information supply is the primary task of information management. The goal is therefore to achieve better business results by an improved information management. In this project methods are developed, which allow to build an information strategy for coordinating projects, information systems and business. These methods are verified on practical business applications.
