  Measuring and Simulation Methods of Power Electronic Circuits  

Being able to predict the behaviour of electronic systems can save significant  amounts of time and lead to lower development costs. To perform such analyses, simulation programs are used. For power electronic applications, these programs lack libraries with models of power devices currently available on the market. Power electronic components are more difficult to model due to their complex behaviour (i.e. dynamic range and large number of charge carriers involved in current transport). Simple models of an Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) and a power diode (PIN) were developed and tested. Correct basic behaviour of the dI/dt and dV/dt control methods was achieved. Two new models of power diodes are being implemented to obtain more accurate simulations. The first model is based on the solution of the ambipolar diffusion equation (ADE), and the second on the lumped-charge approach. The IGBT model will also be improved using the ADE solution method. Power device models require many device specific parameters such as: geometry/topology, doping concentrations, and stray inductances. These parameters can not be obtained from standard data sheets or the manufacturer, but in some cases can be extracted through specific measurements. Therefore, test equipment is being built to measure some important diode and IGBT parameters needed for the simulation models.
