  Rockslide Characterization and Location with Regional Seismic Networks  
This project aims to create a comprehensive remote monitoring package  to identify and classify rock slope failures in continuous seismic data within minutes after occurrence. This will facilitate creation of a centralized rockslide database in Switzerland.
