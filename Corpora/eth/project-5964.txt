  Standardization of Flavonoids and Iridoid Glycosids of Agni casti fructus and Isolation ofBioactive Metabolites from Vitex agnus castus  

 To ensure pharmaceutical quality of herbal extracts there is a need for analytical standardization. Preparations of extracts from the fruits of Vitex agnus castus L. (Lamiaceae) are produced and sold for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome and climacteric disorders. There is little known, however, about the pharmacologically active principles of Agni casti fructus. Only a few compounds have so far been identified; mainly iridoid glycosids (agnuside, aucubin, eurostoside) and flavonoids (penduletin, casticin and their derivatives). The aim of this project is to develop and optimize analytical determination methods for the standardization of these two groups of potentially active compounds. As a selective and sensitive qualitative and quantitative analytical method we are employing HPLC in connection with photodiode array detection. There are findings of metabolites with hormonal mode of action in the leaves of Vitex agnus castus. For the fruits this mode of action has not yet been described. There are, however, some hints of similar activities in the fruits from recent research. A targeted search for these active principles as well as their isolation and the structure determination will also be pursued.
