  Aluminum redistribution during the preparation of hierarchical zeolites by desilication 
Understanding the evolution of the aluminum speciation and related aci-  dity during the preparation of hierarchical zeolites is of vital importance for the rational design of improved catalysts. In this work we apply 27Al MAS and 27Al MQMAS NMR spectroscopy and the IR study of adsorbed pyridine to fol
