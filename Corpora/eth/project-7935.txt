  Short Range Order in Random Binary Alloys  

We are investigating the relationship between the electronic structure of a  random binary alloy and its degree of short range order. On the one hand we construct effective interatomic interaction from the electronic structure obtained in the single-site coherent potential approximation (CPA). Using these parameters and the gamma expansion method (GEM) proposed by Tokar and Massanskii (1,2), we generate the short range order parameter \ga(k), which can directly be compared with the results of diffuse neutron or X-ray scattering experiments. On the other hand, we determine the influence of the short range order so obtained on the electronic structure (specifically the density of states) of the system. We hope to be able in the near future, to include the influence of the short range into the energetics of the alloy in a selfconsistent manner. (1) V.I. Tokar, Phys. Lett. A110, 453 (1985) (2) I.V.
