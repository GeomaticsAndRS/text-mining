  Silicate melt - liquid - vapor equilibria in upper-crustal magmatic systems  
A main goal of the research is to determine the effect of CO2, sulfurous  gases and HCl on the position of the vapor+liquid coexistence surface, relative to the well characterized H2O-NaCl binary fluid system at magmatic conditions.
