  Nonlinear dynamic analysis of Composite Structures using Hysteretic Multiscale Finite Elements  
Composite materials are extensively used in industrial and engineering practice due to their enhanced mechanical and physical properties. Advanced methods however are required for the proper simulation of the behavior of such complex materials. 
Composite materials are extensively used in industrial and engineering practice due to their enhanced mechanical and physical properties such as high strength and stiffness to density ratio, high damping and improved thermal conductivity amongst many. In the field of Civil Engineering, composite materials are used either in the form of fiber reinforcing or textile composites into various applications such as retrofitting and strengthening of damaged structures, supporting cables for cable stayed bridges and high strength bridge decks amongst many. The inherent heterogeneities of such materials, observable to a certain micro-scale, bare a large impact on their overall macroscopic behavior. Accurate modeling of such materials has to be able to account for their microstructure but not at the cost of computational efficiency. Using the Multiscale Finite Element Method and introducing the notion of hysteretic finite elements, a novel method is proposed for the nonlinear dynamic analysis of composite structures. The theoretical implementation of the method is supplemented with a software tool for the analysis of such problems. Efendiev, Y., and Hou, T. Y. (2009). Multiscale Finite Element Methods, Springer.
