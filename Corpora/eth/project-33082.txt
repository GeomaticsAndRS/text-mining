The Live and Work project aims to measure the changes in employee`s flexibility, work-life balance and productivity and to understand the drivers of these changes after the introduction of Microsoft`s New World Of Work. This initiative aims at supporting employees to work whenever and wherever they want by completely changing the organizational culture through the introduction of a new office environment, new collaborative technologies and changing manager leadership styles. The study included repeated measurements using questionnaires and in-depth interviews with employees to identify the changes after the introduction of the New World Of Work. The study reveals that empowering leadership style positively mediates the relationship between the flexibility to arrange work and Work-Life Balance. In addition, the study reveals that boundary strategies aimed at separating work from private life also positively mediates the relationship between the flexibility to arrange work and work life balance. The results suggest that both empowering leadership style by managers and the adoption of boundary strategies by employees are important mechanisms for employees to cope with the new flexibility.
