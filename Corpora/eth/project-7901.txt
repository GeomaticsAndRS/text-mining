  Television for a Blind Old Lady  

Tactile substitution for the blind is sucessful in one dimension (Braille  "reading"), but not in two dimensions, where the tactile system operates on complex figures sequentially, unlike the visual system. We are trying to build a 3D touch screen, in which elevated pixel patterns can be analyzed by multi-finger grips. Preliminary experiments show some fast parallel form recognition and a segmentation by motion.
