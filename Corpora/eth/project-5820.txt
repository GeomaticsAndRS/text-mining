  Rubrerythrin in Clostridium perfringens  

Rubrerythrin is a non-heme iron protein found in the anaerobe Desulfovibrio vulgaris. It  is a protein of unknown function containing both FeS4 and (m-oxo/hydroxo)-diiron sites. We have isolated a protein from the anaerobe Clostridium perfringens which is similar in size (22 kDa) and in its gene (rbr) structure encoding the amino acid motifs for both iron binding sites, therefore we named it rubrerythrin. We were able to assign a superoxide dismutase function (SOD) at the protein level by determination of SOD activity of the purified rubrerythrin and at the genetical level by complementation of E. coli sod mutations by the cloned rbr gene. The aim of this project is a biochemical and cristallographical characterization of the rubrerythrin from Clostridium perfringens and its function as a superoxide dismutase. For these purposes, we will set up a purification procedure to get large amounts (mg) of recombinant rubrerythrin from E. coli. Cristallographical studies will be promising to study the structure of the suggested binuclear iron-center. Regulatory studies will be based on transcriptional analysis of the rbr gene (and in parallel of the sod gene) in response to oxygen-stress or metal-availability in the growth medium for C. perfringens. Mutations either in recombinant rbr genes or in insertionally mutated C. perfringens rbr locations should be produced to study the function(s) of rubrerythrin in C. perfringens.
