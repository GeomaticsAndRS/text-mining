Substituted aromatic amines are important intermediates in chemical industry for the production of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, herbicides and polymers. Usually they are prepared via catalytic reduction of the corresponding nitro compounds. Supported gold catalysts effectively catalyze the selective reduction of the nitro group in the presence of other reducible functional groups. To design highly active and selective catalysts, the origins of the factors that influence the catalytic performance have to be understood. This work aims at establishing the influence of different pretreatment conditions on the catalytic performance.
