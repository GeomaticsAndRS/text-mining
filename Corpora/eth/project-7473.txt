  Physical Processes and Timescales of Ore-Forming Magmatic-Hydrothermal Processes: Farrallon Negro Complex (Argentina) and Ok Tedi (PNG)  

To better constrain the source and composition of magmatic-hydrothermal ore fluids in subduction related systems, we investigate the evolution of ore-forming andesitic complexes with integrated geologic - geochemical study, including melt inclusion analysis and high-precision geochronology and radiogenic isotope geochemistry. The focus of this new project is on the timescales of physical processes in geologically young systems, including Bajo de la Alumbrera (Argentina) and Ok Tedi (Papua New Guinea).
