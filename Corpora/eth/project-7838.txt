  Photorefractive Effects in Organic Materials  

 Photorefractive effects have a wide field of potential applications in optical computing, spatial light-modulation, or multiplexing. These effects are found in materials which combine photoconductivity with electro-optic properties (electric field-induced changes of the refractive index). The aim of this work is the investigation of photorefractive effects in organic compounds. These compounds combine the advantage of a strong electro-optic response with the possibility of tailoring their properties by molecular engineering. Appropriate doping of single crystals was found to induce the desired effect of photoconductivity and lead to the first observation of photorefractive effects in single crystals of 2-cyclooctylamino-5-nitropyridine doped with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane. However, photorefractive effects were also found in nominally pure molecular crystals of 4'nitrobenzylidene-3-acetamino-4-methoxyaniline (MNBA). The strength of the photorefractive response of these crystals is comparable to inorganic compounds. Recently, two new organic photorefractive crystals, namely an organic salt, 4-N,N­dimethylamino-4'-N'- methyl stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) and an hydrazone derivative, 4-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde-4-nitrophenyl- hydrazone (DANPH) were investigated showing photorefractive net gains at near infrared wavelengths (up to 1064nm) for writing times of less than one second. This presents a signficant improvement in writing times as well as the in sensitivity compared to the previous photorefractive organic crystals. Further investigations will aim at a full understanding of the microscopic processes in our materials as well as at a further optimization of the effects using new dopant and host materials.
