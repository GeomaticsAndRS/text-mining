  Improving iron and zinc nutrition in Ethiopian children consuming injera based diets  
The aim of the project is to improve the mineral bioavailability and the content of micronutrients in the Ethiopian staple food injera to meet the nutritional requirements of young children.
In developing countries the diet is often based on cereals and legumes and does not meet the nutritional requirements of young children. A longitudinal, observational study in Ethiopia showed that young children have problems of malnutrition reflected in growth faltering and micronutrient deficiencies. Their diets are mainly based on plant foods and the traditional Ethiopian staple food provides an important part of their nutrient intake. Injera is a soft bread prepared called Sinjera ¸ T by baking a fermented dough based on tef flour. Injera is a good source of minerals such as iron but the bioavailability of iron and other minerals is estimated to be very poor due to naturally occurring absorption inhibitors such phytic acid. The overall aim of the project is to improve the mineral bioavailability and the content of micronutrients in injera to meet the nutritional requirements of young children. This project will include the optimization of the injera fermentation process to improve the micronutrient bioavailability. The predominant microorganisms of the fermentation process will be identified and screened for particular properties. The impact of improved fermentation on mineral bioavailability will first be evaluated in vitro followed by studies in young children using stable isotope techniques. This work will help to adapt the preparation of the traditional local staple food to the nutritional needs of the young children.
