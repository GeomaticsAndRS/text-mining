  Growth of Highly Conductive KTaO3 Crystals  

 Thin films of KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$on KTaO$_{3}$substrates have many applications such as pyroelectric sensors and optical waveguides. Some applications require the orientation of the polarization in the direction perpendicular to the substrate. This is possible only if the substrate used for the thin film growth is conductive. Since the resistivity of intrinsic KTaO$_{3}$is around 10${^12}$\gWm we tried to find a suitable dopant. Doped KTaO$_{3}$crystals were grown from a melt to which was added an impurity. Barium yielded the best results. The size of the grown crystals was normally in the range of 1 cm$^{3}$. The resistivity was measured over a temperature range from 170 to 310 K and was found to be below 1 \gWm over the whole temperature range. The value remained unchanged also after annealing in an oxygen atmosphere, which proves that the observed resistivity was not due to oxygen deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the lowest resistivity observed in this type of crystal achieved by intentional doping. Growth of larger conductive KTaO$_{3}$crystals and and epitaxy of KTa1-xNbxO$_{3}$on them are primary goals of future research.
