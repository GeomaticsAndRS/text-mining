  Flow Modelling of a Temperate Ice Cap: Vatnajökull, Iceland  

A three-dimensional ice flow model, based on the zeroth-order shallow-ice-approximation, is  applied on Vatnajökull to investigate whether the ice cap is in balance with the present mass balance distribution and to make predictions on how it may evolve in the future. Experiments conducted with the model using measured mass-balance distributions show that the Vatnajökull ice cap would grow to approximately its current size, starting from an ice free area under present climatic conditions. If, on the other hand, the mass-balance distribution is not kept fixed, but allowed to change as the altitude at every point changes with time, the ice cap divides up into a number of much smaller ice caps. This preliminary modeling result emphasizes the importance of knowing accurately the dependency of mass balance with elevation. The next steps in this project will therefore be devoted to developing an altitude-dependent mass-balance model and to coupling it to the flow model. This will make it possible to investigate the future development of the Vatnajökull ice cap under different climatic scenarios.
