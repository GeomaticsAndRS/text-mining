  Highly Corrosion Resistant Copper Based Alloys 

In order to develop new copper alloys with a high tarnishing resistance the electrochemical behaviour of  Cu and its alloys are studied in different solutions and at different pH-values. The electrochemical behaviour of the copper alloys is strongly time-dependent, due to a slow growth of protective oxide layers on the surface of the alloys. Due to the formation of protective aluminium oxide layers, ternary Cu-Al-X alloys show very low current densities and a low tendency to form tarnishing films. The formation of this aluminium oxid layer depends strongly on type and content of the third alloying element X. Heat treatment leads to a better corrosion resistance in long-time studies due to a higher structural homogeneity. The effect of phosphorus as a third alloying element is studied in more detail. A series of different binary and ternary Cu-Al, Cu-P and Cu-Al-P alloys are investigated. The effect of impurities as Fe, Ni and Mn, which are usually present in industrially produced alloys, are investigated by series of Cu-Al-X alloys where X is Fe, Ni and Mn in a content of 0.3 and 0.1 at.-% respectively.
