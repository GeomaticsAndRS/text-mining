  Influence of Mechanical Treatment on the Structure of Chymosin-Induced Casein Gels  

According to laboratory experiments the formation of casein gels is accelerated and strengthened by defined shear treatment. On the other hand, gel structures are sensitive to shear forces. Experiments were performed to determine the "window" between the stabilising and destroying influence of shear deformation in gel structures. This project concentrate on the aspect of creating a continuous chymosin induced cheese like gel structure based on suspensions with high solid content in pilot-plant scale. With exposure to well defined shear treatment right after chymosin addition firm gel structures are achieved. Current work focuses on continuously production of chymosin induced gel-structures, analysing of material behaviour and structural changes under varying processing conditions. A new processing line will be developed and applied to industrial scale. In future steps recipe development will take place within the industry. ETH-LMVT will assist this by adapted process/apparatus optimisation and process control.
