  GNSS for Deformation and Geohazard Monitoring  
By providing continuous observations of surface motion, permanent monitoring based on GNSS techniques help to strengthen the understanding of geological processes like landslides, rockfalls and permafrost-related slope instabilities, and can produce precious information for early-warning systems.
