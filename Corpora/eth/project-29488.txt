  MOUNTLAND 2 - Prioritizing for adaptation to climate change and socio-economic changes, Task 4: Preconditions and prospects for long-term oriented policymaking 
The MOUNTLAND-project is a multiyear interdisciplinary research pro-  ject that analyzes the ecological, socio-economic and political implications of climate change in Swiss mountain regions and aims at developing innovative approaches for sustainable land use in these regions.
As part of the larger MOUNTLAND research project (PI: Andreas Rigling, WSL), we investigate the conditions under which long-term oriented policymaking can be strengthened to prepare mountain regions for predicted changes in climate conditions. In addition to the abrupt risks typically associated with changing climate conditions (mainly changing risks related to extreme weather events), also gradually changing climate conditions are increasingly expected to result in significant socio-economic and political impacts. For example, water shortages are very likely to intensify competition between different water users such as agriculture,households and energy production and between water user and protection interests. Or, related to the continuing growth of forests, tensions between forest and landscape protection on the one hand and land-user interests (construction, agriculture, tourism) could further accentuate. Due to their multi-objectivity and cross-level characteristics, effective long-term oriented strategies and policy programs need to find ways to strike a balance between these potentially conflicting interests and societal goals and objectives.
