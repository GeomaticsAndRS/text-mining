  Sustainable Development in Zurich West  

Zurich West is one of the most dynamic areas in the city of Zurich, which means that the former  industrial areas become more and more an urban place. The research project examines these dynamic urban development processes, especially in the context of sustainability. The goal is to create a set of indicators for this specific situation of urban development, and to form an idea of a sustainable development of Zurich West. Therefore existing planning instruments should be examined for their utility regarding sustainability.
