  Statistical estimation of very large dependence graphs and applications to genetic regulatory networks  
The project deals with estimating a dependence graph from data. The graph describes conditional stochastic dependencies among very many random variables. The mo-  tivation for the project comes from estimating genetic regulatory networks based on gene expression data.
