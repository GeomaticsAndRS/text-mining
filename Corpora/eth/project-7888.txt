  PtSi-nSi Schottky Barrier Photodetectors for the Far-UV with Stable Spectral Responsivityinthe 120 nm to 250 nm Wavelength Range  

 Novel front-illuminated PtSi-nSi Schottky barrier photodiodes have been developed for the ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet spectral range, to meet the need in stable semiconductor secondary radiation standards for wavelengths below 170 nm. The diodes possess an optically transparent (< 10nm) Schottky contact with guard ring, and a substrate contact on the front-side of the diode chip. The spectral responsivity in the vacuum UV and, in particular, of the stability of the diodes photoresponse under high radiant exposure at different wavelengths, has been studied at the VUV radiometry laboratory of the PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) located at the 800 MeV electron storage ring BESSY in Berlin. For wavelengths 120 nm to 250 nm, the responsivity is about 0.03 A/W, roughly the same as that of the best available GaAsP Schottky photodiodes but with a superior uniformity over the active diode surface. The rms deviation of the measured responsivity across the diode surface is 0.6% - 0.8%, approximately equal to the accuracy of the homogeneity measurement. The diodes are stabil under UV radiation; even after a radiant exposure of 150 mJ cm$^{-2}$at wavelength 120 nm, the relative reduction in spectral responsivity remains below 0.2%. This high stability is due to the chemically stable silicide-silicon interface and the lack of surface oxide on the photo-sensitive area. The novel PtSi-nSi Schottky barrier photodiodes are promising candidates for use as secondary detector standards in the ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet spectral ranges or as photon detectors for satellite-based UV and VUV astronomy. By their technology, they are also suitable for use in front illuminated UV and VUV sensitive CCD arrays.
