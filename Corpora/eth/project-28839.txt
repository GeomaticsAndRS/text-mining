  Plasma-Enhanced Surface Coating for Advanced Graphite Negative Electrode Materials 
More than 50% of lithium ion batteries today use a surface-coated graphite as the active negative electrode material. Current surface coating techniques involve toxic  and carcinogenic materials. The goal of this project is to develop an environmentally safe and cost effective alternative.
