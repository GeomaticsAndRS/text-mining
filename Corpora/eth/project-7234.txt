  Advanced Resource Management in Service Integrated and Multi-layered HFC Access Networks (AROMA)  

 The main topic of the European research project AROMA was the resource management of an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) based Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) access network. The achieved results show how resource management can provide end-to-end quality of service (QoS) in a heterogeneous network environment. In particular, the HFC network segment requires novel methods of resource management by means of signalling between the user terminals and an ATM switch via a HFC specific management unit. The system is able to provide QoS for native ATM services as well as for Internet protocol (IP) based applications enhanced with a resource reservation protocol. In February 2000 the AROMA project has been finished. Our laboratory was leading the native ATM working group. The main activities were the specification and implementation of a platform independent native ATM application programming interface (API) and the development of native ATM services. The native ATM API has been used as a basis for different native ATM services and applications. The implementation of the ATM performance measurement system (PMS) has been completed. PMS is a tool for end-to-end measurements of delay and jitter over the native ATM protocol stack. The working group has successfully achieved all objectives.
