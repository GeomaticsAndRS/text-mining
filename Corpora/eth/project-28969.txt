  Purification of Proteins from Human Blood Plasma with MCSGP  
In order to find a more convenient way to purify proteins from human blood plasma for therapeutical applications, the possible use of multicolumn solvent gradient purification (MCSGP) in this field is investigated.
Proteins isolated from human blood plasma are an important class of therapeutics used in the management, treatment or prevention of conditions and/or diseases caused by trauma, infections or genetic deficiences [1]. Chromatography has been increasingly used in blood plasma fractionation recently, most of the application are however limited to batch purifications of a side stream of the historic Cohn process [2-3]. When dealing with complex mixture, where no base-line separation is possible, preparative non-affinity batch chromatography suffers from an inherent purity-yield tradeoff. In these cases, Multicolumn Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) offers a way to achieve both high purity and high yield at the same time [4]. It has indeed been shown that MCSGP is suitable for isolating and purifying proteins from complicated mixtures, like cell supernatant [5]. In this work, the application of MCSGP to the separation and purification of proteins from human blood plasma is investigated. T. Burnouf, Transfusion Medicine Reviews 21 (2007) 101. E.J.
