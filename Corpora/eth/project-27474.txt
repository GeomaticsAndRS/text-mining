  A droplet-on-demand robotic platform  

Droplet-based (or segmented-flow) microfluidics describes the generation and manipulation of discrete droplets contained within an immiscible continuous phase. Such systems make use of two immiscible phases to create discrete volumes that reside a move within a continuous flow. Droplets of the dispersed phase are produced as a result of shear force and interfacial tension at the fluid-fluid interface. Importantly segmented-flow microfluidics allows for the production of monodisperse droplets at rates in excess of tens of KHz and for independent control of each droplet (in terms of their size, position and contents). These unique features have great potentials in biological experimentation. Droplets can be generated using a variety of chip architectures, with the two most popular designs being based on T-junctions and flow focusing geometries. Droplets and plugs can also be generated using aspiration techniques. In broad terms this approach generates droplets using an aspiring needle that penetrates the aqueous /oil interface. This project aims to design, build and apply a novel robotic droplet generation device for high-throughput biology. This automated droplet-ondemand (DOD) generator will be used to create droplets from user-defined input data such as: frequency and size. The robotic platform will then be used to perform massively parallel experiments to screen protein-protein interactions, from artificial bilayer systems and perform single cell analysis.
