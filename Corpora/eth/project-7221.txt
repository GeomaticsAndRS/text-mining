  Minimally Invasive Bedside Monitoring of Cerebral Hemodynamics with Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Dye Dilution 

 Early detection and treatment of cerebral ischemia to prevent further neurological damage in patients with severe brain injury represent important tasks in neurological medicine. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a useful tool for minimally invasive monitoring of cerebral blood flow, in particular, if it is applied in combination with indocyanine green as a tracer substance which can systemically be administered and detected by NIRS. As the influence of extracerebral bone and surface tissue on NIRS aignals in the adult head has not been clarified yet, a conventional subdural probe for monitoring intracerebral pressure (ICP) was extended with two optical fiber bundles for NIRS measurements. This probe can be inserted into the subdural space to perform the same measurements as conventional (external) probes with the exception of contamination by extracerebral tissue. To clarify the physical processes and thus to be able to interpret the results of NIRS measurements, Monte Carlo simulations of light scattering are being made on a model of the human head that is based on MRI data.
