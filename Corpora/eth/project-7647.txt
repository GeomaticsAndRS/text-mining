  High Resolution Analysis of Axisymmetric Wave Modes in Cylindrical Structures  

Guided structural waves are used to explore the dynamic behaviour of cylindricalstructures like fluid-loaded tubes, isotropic rods and anisotropic rods. In the case ofthe fluid-loaded cylindrical shell the frequency range between 1 kHz and 2 MHzdemands a viscoelastic description of the "fluid". Therefore the relation betweenfrequency and complex wavenumber of axially symmetric waves in cylindrical shellsloaded by a viscoelastic medium is derived and confirmed experimentally.A heterodyne LASER interferometer is used to measure the radial and thelongitudinal displacement of the shell surface. The signals are processed with FFT inthe time domain. To decompose the complex wave-number dependence, a complextotal least squares algorithm is used in the space domain. It extracts both, real andimaginary part of the wavenumber from the measured data.The experiments are performed using a steel tube with a diameter of 25 mm and awall thickness of 0.5 mm. The tubes are filled with water, milk, alcohol, glycerine,silicone oil and polyisobutylen. The axisymmetric waves are excited with a radiallyand a longitudinally acting piezoelectric transducer simultaneously. Up to 40dispersion curves of travelling, axisymmetric modes can be decomposed at the sametime in a frequency range between 1 kHz and 2 MHz. Excellent agreement betweennumerical and experimental results was found over a wide parameter range.
