  Carbon emission and transfer along river systems 
River systems act as important conduits in the global carbon cycle. We  investigate the role of wetlands and dams in the carbon cycle of the Zambezi River (Southern Africa) and the Aare River (Switzerland). We analyze CO2 and CH4 emissions and the sources and sink of organic carbon.
