  A Language Approach for Multicore and Distributed Programming (Zonnon project)  
In this project we investigate programming models to explore locality in concurrent object-oriented programs. In the examined approach we view a single application as a constellation of communicating active objects and in practice we target distributed environments and many core processors. 
This project is aimed at increasing developerSs productivity and reducing entry barriers to programming highly concurrent and distributed applications by means of a novel programming model. It is accompanied by a language tool capable to enforce certain properties desired for the model. The key property addressed by the model is locality that enables the compiler to perform clustering of the application into loosely coupled components. Zonnon is a variation of the Oberon programming language aiming towards support of object structures instead of individual objects. Zonnon views applications as constellations of active objects with two types of object relations: objects that communicate directly via method calls (strong coupled) and objects that communicate via protocols (loosely coupled). Protocols for communication are exposed by object interfaces. Objects communicate through channels which ownership is statically ensured and thus compiler can validate communication up to a certain level at compile time. In addition Zonnon language is specifically tailored to language interoperability with the first implementation for Microsoft's .net platform. Second important target for the language is native code for an experimental multi core processor (network on a chip).
