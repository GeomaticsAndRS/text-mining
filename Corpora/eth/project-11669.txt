  Structural studies of large macromolecular assemblies  
With an aim to better understand structure and function of large eukaryotic multienzyme complexes we are studying fatty acid synthase (FAS). In eukaryotes, all steps of fatty acid synthesis are catalyzed by fatty acid synthase, a giant multifunctional enzyme that contains seven catalytic domains.
