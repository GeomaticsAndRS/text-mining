  Fundamental Understanding of Peptide Adsorption in Reversed-Phase Chromatography 
Study on the effect of the stationary phase properties (pore size distribu-  ˇ and peptide properties (size, charges, counter-ionsE) ˇ on the adsorption tion, surface chemistryE) behavior of polypeptides in reversed-phase chromatography.
