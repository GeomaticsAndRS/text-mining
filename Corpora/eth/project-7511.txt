  Minerals in Industry  

Mineral assemblages which are important in industrial products and processes are  characterized qualitatively and quantitatively by X-ray diffraction. The technique of analyzing small and very small samples by high resolution X-ray diffraction is further developed. The limits of analysis of mixes of powdered material are explored. Industrial products involved are: carbonate filler, mica filler products, concrete, cement, hazardous waste, fly ash, Ti-oxides used for electrodes of Pb/PbSO$_{4}$-accumulators, lead oxide of electrode materials.
