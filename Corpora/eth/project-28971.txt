  Multi order-parameter coupling in naturally layered perovskite-related materials from first principles 
Here we clarify how different structural distortions give rise to the exceptional ferroelectric properties of naturally layered crystal structures such as e.g. the Aurivillius  phases, and we explore ways to incorporate additional magnetic properties to create a robust multiferroic material.
