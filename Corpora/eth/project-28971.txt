  Multi order-parameter coupling in naturally layered perovskite-related materials from first principles 
Here we clarify how different structural distortions give rise to the exceptional ferroelectric properties of naturally layered crystal structures such as e.g. the Aurivillius  phases, and we explore ways to incorporate additional magnetic properties to create a robust multiferroic material.
We address the question of how combinations of different structural distortions give rise to the exceptional ferroelectric properties of naturally-layered perovskite-related systems such as e.g. the Aurivillius phases, and explore ways to control and modify these properties both chemically (by doping) and mechanically (by applying stress/pressure). In particular, we will clarify if and how it is possible to incorporate additional magnetic properties in these materials in order to create robust multiferroic or magnetoelectric properties at room temperature. Such multifunctional properties offer great potential for many technological applications; our research will guide the optimization of these properties to enable the design of novel materials with enhanced functionalities. To this end we are using first principles electronic structure calculations that allow us to calculate and analyze the properties of hypothetical new compositions based on the fundamental many-body Schroedinger equation describing the interaction between electrons and ions in arbitrary materials.
