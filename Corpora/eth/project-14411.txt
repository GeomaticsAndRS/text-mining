  Sums of squares 
The aim of his project to investigate generalizations and applications of Kronecker limit formulas.
 Finding exact formulas for sums of squares is one of the oldest problems in mathematics. The subject got revitalized after J. Milne , in 1996, announced infinite families of formulas for sums of squares generalizing the ones obtained by Jacobi. The aim of this project is to look for and prove such formulas.
