  Development of multifunctional bakery bioingredients and nutritional supplements by fermentation of cocultures of lactic acid bacteria and propionibacteria  
Multifunctional nutritional ingredients will be developed by fermentation technology using selected strains of Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium co-cultivated in optimized cereal-based medium, leading to high levels of B vitamins, and antifungal and antistaling properties.
Multifunctional ingredients will be developed by fermentation technology using selected strains of Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium co-cultivated in optimized cereal-based medium. Their metabolic activities will lead to naturally-produced functional substances of particular interest to the bakery and nutritional supplement sector: high levels of organic acids (propionic and acetic) and other compounds with antimicrobial and flavor-enhancing effects; folate and vitamin B12 in balanced and nutritionally-relevant levels; and exopolysaccharides (EPS) for improving product texture and shelf life. The technology will be transferred to industry scale, including down processing. Finally the multifunctional ingredients (both whey- and cereal-based) will be tested in selected applications of bakery and nutritional supplements and evaluated for stability.
