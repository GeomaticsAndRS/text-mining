  Development and characterization of a pH sensitive slow release system to reduce inflammatory processes in the degenerated intervertebral disc  
The aim of this study is to develop and characterize a minimal-invasively applicable slow-release system for epigallocatechine gallate (EGCG) that could be used to e.g. treat panful disc degeneration.
