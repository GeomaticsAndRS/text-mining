  Is fullerene a nonmetal catalyst in the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene?  
A recent report claimed that fullerene is a nonmetal catalyst for mol. activation of hydrogen, and that its catalytic activity is comparable to that of a noble metal catalyst. aË˜ The mechanism of the mol. hydrogen activation in these systems is unclear at present.
