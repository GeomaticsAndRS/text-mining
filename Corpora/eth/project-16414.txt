  Lattice QCD at finite density  
The interactions among quarks, described by QCD,  are believed to undergo qualitative changes as their temperature and/or their density is increased. Such new states of matter are the object of experimental heavy-ion collision programs. Here we study this regime of QCD by computer simulations.
Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice have been very successful at measuring the properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), at zero and non-zero temperature. However, when the net density of (quarks minus antiquarks) is non-zero, standard Monte Carlo simulations fail because the fermion determinant becomes complex and cannot be used to define a Monte Carlo probability. This is the notorious "sign problem". We are trying several methods to obtain information on QCD, at least in the regime of small non-zero densities. We have had success using an imaginary chemical potential, then analytically continuing our results, and using a canonical formalism where the net number of baryons (or quarks) is fixed. With these simulations we can map part of the phase diagram of QCD as a function of temperature and density. Our predictions are important for the understanding of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments, ongoing at Brookhaven Nat. Lab. and soon to start at CERN.
