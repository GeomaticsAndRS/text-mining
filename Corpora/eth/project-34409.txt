  The transport and fate of colloid and nanoparticle contaminants in the subsurface environment  
The proposed investigates the dynamics of particle remobilization in controlled laboratory experiments with the long-term objective to predict and prevent re-mobilization incidents in natural and heterogeneous soils at the field scale. 
The fate and transport of colloid and nanoparticle contaminants in subsurface environments is a topic of significant interest because soils are the primary filter for water resources. Traditionally, soil systems are managed as natural filters that efficiently and permanently remove suspended contaminants from the infiltrating groundwater. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that significant colloid and nanoparticle re-mobilization in environmental porous media can be induced by imposing disturbances to the flow hydrodynamics (e.g., increasing flow rate) or solution chemistry (e.g., reducing the ionic strength). In practice, intermittent high-rate well pumping episodes and rain/irrigation infiltration are classic events that produce such physico-chemical disturbances. Therefore, well-devised management strategies that control soil-water chemistry and flow rates can help protect groundwater resources from inadvertent contamination. The proposed work will systematically investigate the dynamics of particle remobilization in controlled laboratory experiments with the long-term objective to predict and prevent re-mobilization incidents in natural and heterogeneous soils at the field scale.
