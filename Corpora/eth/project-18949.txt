  Incentive Contracts for Politicians and Dual Democracy  
We investigate whether the combination of incentive contracts for politicians and elections (dual democracy) can help to improve democratic election processes. 
We investigate how democratic constitutions can be designed to achieve an efficient provision of public projects. In particular, we analyze a variety of new types of decision and agenda rules that have been invented by our chair. Examples: flexible majority rules: the size of the majority needed depends on the proposal made by the agenda setter, two-stage unanimity rules: in the first stage, voters decide on a broad package of public projects; if the package is rejected, only voting about single projects is allowed, flexible agenda costs: the costs for agenda-setting depend on the number of supporting votes, rotating agenda setting and agenda repetition in combination with flexible majority rules, minority voting: only the losing minority of one period keeps the voting right for the collective decision in the next period.
