  Barriers to the Accuracy of Stable Difference Schemesfor Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations 

 When solving hyperbolic initial boundary value problem using difference methods one is interested in stable schemes only. Gustafsson, Kreiss, Sundström have shown that, instead of studying the two point boundary value problem with variable coefficients it is enough to consider the constant coefficient equation on a half plane. Even for systems this problem can be reduced to the study of several scalar advection equations with constant coefficients. A sufficient condition for the stability of the interior scheme as well as for the stability of the boundary scheme is that the characteristic polynomial associated with the scheme has all roots bounded by one and the roots of modulus one are simple. These stability requirements limit the accuracy a scheme can have. It has been conjectured that the order of accuracy is bounded by twice the number of stencil points on one side of the characterist the 'newest' point. For one step schemes this conjecture has been proved in 1987. Now one treats explicit and implicit two-step schemes.
