  AKQUI - Acquisition system for network traffic analysis and testing  

Embedded in research about network performance analysis and monitoring, a  suitable measurement system is being developed. AKQUI is a system that allows to log and tag the cells flowing in multiple ATM links for several hours. The actual in-depth traffic analysis is performed off-line. It is also possible to set up traffic patterns off-line and transmit them in real-time for test purpose, e.g. to test the UPC-function of a switch. Althought the system is primarly focused on ATM networks, the system may also be used for other types of networks, i.e. for Packet-over-Sonet Links.
