  Conformational analysis of cyclic olefins 

 The conformational space of cyclooctene has been explored computationally in order to rationalize its high epoxidation selectivity. Four different conformations were identified. Each conformation is chiral and has two enantiomeric forms. The degeneracy is further increased by a ringinversion process, yielding a total of 16 conformers. The potential energy surface for the interconversion of these conformers was characterized via intrinsic reaction coordinate analyses. Furthermore, an evaluation of the microcanonical partition functions allowed for a quantification of the entropy contributions and hence the calculation of the equilibrium composition at different temperatures. The results strongly suggest that the high epoxidation selectivity, typically observed for cyclooctene, is related to a poor orbital overlap in the predominant conformation, disfavoring alphaH-abstraction by radical species and thus allylic byproduct formation via undesired homolytic side-reactions. Work is in progress on the structure of humulene. (J. Org. Chem. 2011, 76, 10236)
