  The Molecular Mechanism of Plant Morphogenesis  

Understanding how an organ is initiated at a particular time and place is a major problem  in developmental biology. In plants, the generation of new leaves occurs in a precise pattern throughout post-embryonic growth in a specialised tissue, the shoot apical meristem. Although transcription factors play a key role in laying down the plan of the meristem, how the blueprint of these molecular architects is transduced into changes in physical form is unknown. Potential target processes include cell wall extensibility and cell division frequency and orientation. Using an inducible promoter system, we have established a method for locally manipulating gene expression within the meristem and are now using this system to locally overexpress genes whose products influence these various cellular processes. We thus hope to address the fundamental question: what is the relative role of cell division and expansion in plant morphogenesis at the apical meristem? Three graduate students are focussing on various aspects of this problem: Stéphane Pien is manipulating cell wall extensibility in the meristem and also identifying marker genes for leaf initiation. Joanna Wyrzykowska is manipulating cell division frequency and orientation in the meristem. Ori Schipper is identifying genes involved in controlling cell wall extensibility and using reverse genetics to obtain knock-out mutations.
