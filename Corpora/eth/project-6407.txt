  Basic questions in protein folding 

 We have started a new project where we apply random mutagensis experiments in concombination with screening or selection procedures at the bacterial colony level to obtain novel information on important problems in protein folding. As an example, we have recently performed a random circular permutation analysis on the DsbA protein from E. coli to answer the question whether unique nucleation sites exist in a polypeptide chain that are essential for protein folding and stability. The disulfide oxidoreductase DsbA is a monomeric two-domain protein of 189 residues with known three-dimensional structure. After linkage of the natural terrmini we have randomly disrupted each regular secondary structure and each loop region of the protein by introduction of new termini and asked the question whether the circularly permuted proteins are still capable to fold to a functional tertiary structure. Surprisingly, we found that only 4 alpha-helices in the protein may not be disrupted by new termini without loss of folding competence. Random circular permutation may thus be used in the future to identify the segments in a protein that are essential for folding. As some of the circularly permuted DsbA variants that we have generated are more active than the wild type protein, circular permutation may also become a useful tool to generate proteins with improved functions. We have now extended this random circular permutation approach to other model proteins.
