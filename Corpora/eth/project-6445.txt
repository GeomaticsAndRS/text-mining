  Nutrient uptake and the function of boron in the elongating pollen tube of Nicotiana tabacum  

 Not all living organisms require boron. It is essential for vascular plants and some diatoms; most algal species as well as prokaryotes and animals do not depend on this element. The list of influences of boron on plant development is large, however, very little is known yet about the nature and mechanisms of the processes in which it is involved. The objective of this project is to understand nutrient uptake and especially the function of the micronutrient boron in the male gametophyte during plant sexual reproduction. In vivo, nutrients are supplied from the pistil to the growing pollen tube, in vitro, the presence of boron and other nutrients is required in the germination medium for optimal tube growth. Concentration measurements in various tobacco organs revealed particularly high amounts of boron in reproductive organs with highest levels in the pistil, in anthers and in mature pollen. We presently investigate the fitness of pollen under various boron conditions within the plant during reproduction. A comparative study of gene expression between dry pollen, germinating pollen and pollen germinated under boron deficient conditions was conducted by the means of the differential display technique. The differential display approach did not reveal differences in specific mRNA levels between boron-sufficient and boron-deficient pollen tubes. This indicates that a potential response of the pollen tube system to boron deficiency does not occur at the level of transcription or mRNA stability. However, the comparison between dry pollen and germinated pollen yielded a number of partial cDNAs, the corresponding genes of which may be expressed in a pollenspecific manner. Two of these cDNAs were chosen for further investigations and we now want to analyse the role of their gene products in pollen development.
