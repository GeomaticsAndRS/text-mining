  Swiss Foreign and Security Policy 1972-1986: The failure of the multilateral approach  

 The dissertation focuses on Swiss Foreign Policy during the period of the early 1970s to the mid-1980s which was characterized by the intention of the Swiss Government to move towards increased multilateral cooperation. But the Swiss engagement in the CSCE process was reduced to the traditional role of mediating between East and West, to keep the follow-up conferences alive in the early 1980s, and the referendum on the UN was rejected in 1986. The study explores why the goals of the official Swiss Foreign Policy were not implemented and especially asks what influence the worsening international environment (second Cold War, crisis of the UN) had on the decision-making process on foreign policy.
