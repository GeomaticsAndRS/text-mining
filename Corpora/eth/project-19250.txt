  LCA4AFR Tool  
The goal of this project is to build an Excel based tool for the environmental assessment of co-processing alternative fules and raw materials in industry. 
The substitution of energy carriers and raw material with wastes and industrial by-products has the potential to mitigate many of the environmental burdens arising from resource-intensive industries. At the same time, such resource substitution might serve as a waste management solution, and thus reducing the need for conventional waste treatments like waste incineration or landfilling. The project aims at the development of a set of user-friendly software tools for the assessment of environmental impacts of the co-processing of various alternative fuels and raw materials (AFRs). The 'tool box' is intended to encompass several industrial processes e.g. clinker production and hot metal production in blast furnaces.
