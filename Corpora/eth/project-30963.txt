  BETL - A Generic Boundary Element Template Library  
We develop a modular, efficient, versatile boundary element code both for rapid prototyping and high-performance simulation. Implementation is done in C++ and heavily relies on generic programming principles. 
Many relevant physical phenomena are modeled via second order (elliptic) partial differential operators with constant coefficients. Well-known examples are steady-state heat conduction, electrostatics, eddy-currents, and acoustic or electro-magnetic scattering. In specific scenarios their numerical treatment by Boundary Element Methods is superior to that of volume based discretization schemes. However, up to now there exists no software package which allows for a unified treatment of those models in the context of Boundary Element Methods. The Boundary Element Template Library (BETL) implements building blocks for 3D Galerkin discretiza- tions of arbitrary boundary integral operators. It equally aims for rapid prototyping of new Boundary El- ement formulations as well as for the development of efficient and robust industrial strength solvers. To achieve the latter goal BETL provides interfaces to matrix compression algorithms to reduce the Boundary Element methodSs inherent quadratic complexity to almost linear costs. BETLSs implementation is based on generic software paradigms. Entirely written in C, its core func- tionality is implemented as a header-only library, which makes it highly portable and attractive for being interfaced with existing C codes.
