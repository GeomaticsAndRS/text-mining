  QTL mapping of virulence and other quantitative traits in the model plant pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola 
We will combine QTL mapping with the genome sequence of M. grami-  nicola to identify candidate genes that underlie important quantitative traits in this pathogen, including virulence, fungicide resistance, and temperature adaptation.
