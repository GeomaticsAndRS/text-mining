  A Fresh Look at the Complexity of Pivoting in Linear Complementarity 
We study both linear and convex quadratic programming in a more general setting: by examining the linear complementarity problem with sufficient matrices. Besides  providing a unifying framework for the two problems, linear complementarity also has many direct applications.
We study both linear and convex quadratic programming in a more general setting: by examining the linear complementarity problem with sufficient matrices. Besides providing a unifying framework for the two problems, linear complementarity also has many direct applications, e.g. in control theory, finance, algorithmic game theory. The tools we will use in our research can generally be described as combinatorial abstract models of optimisation problems. We concentrate on two of them: oriented matroids and unique-sink orientations. Several algorithms have been suggested by previous research in this area. For most of them there are both positive and negative results: they are known to be polynomial on some subclasses of the problems, but super-polynomial on other, larger classes. For many classes, however, such analysis is missing (among them are the two we consider the most important, that is, LCP with P-matrices and with sufficient matrices). At present randomised algorithms appear promising, and hence we plan to concentrate on their analysis. We plan to attack the problem from two sides. We aim to find new classes of problems for which some algorithm runs in polynomial (or expected polynomial) time; and we will search for new examples of abstract optimisation problems for which known algorithms are slow. This will in turn reduce the gap between positive and negative results for these algorithms. We believe that this approach will eventually lead to a strongly polynomial algorithm for the linear complementarity problem with sufficient matrices.
