  4-D ADAMELLO : an integrated approach to understand crustal growth processes from a geodynamical, petrological and isotope geochemical perspective  
This ProDoc proposal is an interdisciplinary study of the Adamello batholith in the southern Alps aimed to provide crucial links between geophysical observations and geochemical studies in active arcs, providing first order constrains on heat an mass transfer from mantle and lower to upper crust.
