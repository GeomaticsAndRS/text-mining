  SMicrobiology ¸ in aqueous/organic reaction media: cellular metabolism and biocatalyst productivityTˇ  
We are studying the physiology of whole microbial cells used as biocatalysts for oxidoreductions in organic / aqueous media (energy metabolism, enzyme overexpression). The goal is to achieve an average productivity of 1000 to 2000 international units / liter on pilot scale.
