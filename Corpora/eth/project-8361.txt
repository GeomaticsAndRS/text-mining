  SNADPH ¸ Metabolism and Riboflavin Production in B. subtilisS¸  
One objective is to identify the key players of NADPH metabolism in this organism and the global control mechanisms of NADPH metabolism. Also, we are using a high-throughput screening approach to identify previously unrecognized genes that are relevant for high-level production of riboflavin.
