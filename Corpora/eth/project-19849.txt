  Inference in robust linear regression  
Inference for linear regression models is commonly based on Least Squares. Robust estimators have been introduced to cope with outliers and long-tailed error distributions. Corresponding tests and confidence regions are still a matter of research.
Inference for linear regression models is commonly based on Least Squares. Robust estimators have been introduced to cope with outliers and long-tailed error distributions. Corresponding tests and confidence regions are still a matter of research. Inference for most robust fitting techniques can and should be based on the distributional properties of an M-estimator, usually with redescending psi function. The plain asymptotic normal distribution of such estimators is easy to derive and well known. For finite samples, there are several possibilities to improve the asymptotic approximation. We focus on ­ more precise estimation of the error variance ­ estimation of the covariance matrix of the estimator
