  Persistent Object Programs  
Many of the objects created by object-oriented programs should survive individual program executions. The POP project investigates solutions making objects persistent by default, without explicit programmer intervention, taking advantage of relational and O-O database technology. 
Reducing or eliminating the gap between the programming model (object-oriented) and the data model used in a persistent store (relational or object-oriented database).
