  Domain wall characterization in ferroic materials by high-resolution cathode-lens microscopy  
We study the unusual physical properties that emerge at ferroelectric and multiferroic domain walls using low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) and photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). 
At ferroic domain walls completely new material properties can emerge due to their low symmetry, geometric confinement, electrostatics, and strain. We apply low energy electron microscopy and photoemission electron microscopy in order to investigate domain walls in multiferroic materials such as ErMnO3. Using such non-invasive / non-destructive electron microscopy methods we characterize the unusual electronic and magnetic domain wall properties, as well as domain wall related variations in the chemical material composition.
