  Stability and phase relations of carbonate systems at high pressures and temperatures  

 Experimental investigations are carried out in a multi-anvil apparatus at 5 - 7 Gpa and 900\dg - 1400\dgC using various mixtures of calcite, dolomite and magnesite. The investigations are performed to derive a high-pressure phase diagram for the system and apply it to subduction zone szenarios.
