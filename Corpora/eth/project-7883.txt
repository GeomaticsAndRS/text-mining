  Receiver Arrays for Bit-Parallel Optical Interconnects  

Parallel optical links operate at multi-gigabit per second rates with better immunity against  electromagnetic interference as well as lower power consumption, weight and volume than their electrical counterparts. Mass-manufacturable array components are developed to reduce costs. Low-threshold short-wave laser diode arrays are used as transmitters. Fibre ribbon cables, waveguide arrays or free space serve as optical paths. Data is transmitted bitparallel, no line-coding is required, thus the data paths need to be direct-coupled. The so called burst-mode receivers adapt the decision level during the first incoming bit of a burst by use of a peak detector. Receiver design emphasizes ease and stability of operation. A 12 channel array has been developed on a semicustom 0.8 \gmm silicon bipolar technology (Siemens Corporate Research). The module has been assembled using 70 \gmm diameter photodiode arrays fabricated in our laboratories. Each channel operates at up to 1 Gbit/s with 10 dB dynamic range and 2 Gbit/s with 6 dB. It operates from a single, standard power supply. Differential open-collector outputs ("CML") are used to match a wide range of interface circuits. These components are currently applied by Siemens in prototype fiber ribbon links.
