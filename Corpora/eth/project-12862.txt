  Direct EPR detection  

Instead of down-converting the microwave frequency as is usually done in an EPR experiment, the signal can be directly detected using modern fast oscilloscopes. This corresponds to the measurement of the transverse magnetization in the laboratory frame, rather than in the rotating frame. With an oscilloscope with a wide analog bandwidth and a sampling rate of up to 60 Giga samples per second, free induction decays, electron spin echoes, echo-detected EPR spectra and electron spin echo envelope modulation patterns can be measured up to X-band frequencies. Moreover, direct detection of continuous wave EPR signals will be investigated. This opens the vast field of digital signal processing of the EPR microwave raw data, including extensive filtering, FFT, and in-phase and out-of-phase detection.
