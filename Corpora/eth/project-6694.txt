  Supervised Statistical Learning for Gene Expression Microarray Data  

Microarray technology yields simultaneous measurements of thousands of genes for each single cell. Such biomolecular information plays an important role for understanding functional genomics in various organisms. Our project focuses on cases where additional (supervised) information of the cells is available such as cancer types or survival times. One principal difficulty is the very high dimension of predictor variables (number of genes which varies between 3000 - 15000) compared to sample size (number of cells which varies between 30 - 100). Problems under inverstigation include the following: (i) developing new machine learning methods for classification of tumor types; (ii) finding relevant groups of genes (rather than single genes) for discrimination of tumor types and for explaining survival times; (iii) assigning significance measures for genes and groups of genes in the presence of very many multiple hypotheses.
