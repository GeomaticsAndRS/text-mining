  The Role of Proteolytic Enzymes in Processing and Degradation of the Wound Signal Systemin  

 Plants respond to insect attack with the rapid accumulation of defense proteins. In tomato plants, wounding releases localized and systemic signal molecules which lead to the induction of defense genes. The 18-amino-acid peptide systemin is a key component in the systemic wound signaling pathway. In our efforts to identify proteins in tomato plasma membranes that interact with systemin and that may be involved in systemin perception, a protein (SBP50) was identified that binds systemin with high specificity. The properties of SBP50 resemble those of the yeast kex2 protease and animal prohormone convertases. We intend to elucidate the function of this class of proteases and possible other systemin-processing enzymes in the wound signal transduction pathway. Toward this end, we isolated cDNAs and genes of kex2p-like proteases from tomato. These proteases have been found to be encoded by a large gene family comprising at least 15 members in five subfamilies. Four of these have been expressed in a baculovirus-insect cell system and the recombinant proteins are presently being characterized. Using transgenic plants, the role of these proteases in wound signaling will be analyzed in planta. In a second line of experiments, we employ a genetic screen related to the yeast two-hybrid-system in order to identify tomato cDNAs encoding proteases that may be involved in the maturation of systemin from its precursor protein as well as in systemin degradation.
