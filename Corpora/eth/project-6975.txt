  Comparative Analysis of Great Revolutions : China and Mexico in the 20th Century  

 This comparative analysis focuses on two main aspects: On the one hand the desintegration of central State power in the early revolutionary phase and the rise of regional rulers (warlords in China ; caudillos in Mexico) in the 1920's, and on the other hand the question of peasant involvement in the revolutionary process. The latter aspect is particularly significant since both revolutions have long been interpreted as classic peasant revolutions, which in the case of Mexico has been called into question since the 1970's, and also in the case of China started to be subject of investigations, finally made possible with the post-Mao opening, calling for a more elaborate view of the peasant's participation in revolution.
