  Sustainable Land Use and Forestry Production in the Greifensee Watershed Area  

 More diversified demands on agricultural and natural landscape lead to an increasing number of land use conflicts, especially in densely populated areas in the vicinity of larger cities and their suburbs. The main objective of the project consists in the elaboration of concepts for sustainable agricultural and forestry land use in the Swiss Midlands and the respective policy measures for their implementation. The watershed area of Greifensee close to Zurich serves as a case study area. Research is dealt with in two types of interdisciplinary projects: \md Specific projects deal with different aspects of the problem under study. \md The Core Project integrates the results of the specific projects and provides a qualitative and quantitative answer to the basic idea of the research project. The project commenced in Spring 2000 and will run for five years. It was initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture. Various departments of ETH Zurich, the Swiss Federal Research Station for Agroecology and Agriculture, the Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology and the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape are working together on this project which is headed by the Institute of Agricultural Economics at ETH.
