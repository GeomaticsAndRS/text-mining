  Magnetic anisotropy of pyroxenes, amphiboles and feldspars 
AMS depends on the composition, mainly the location and concentration of iron atoms, and the crystallographic structure. In this project, AMS of single crystals from the amphibole, pyroxene and feldspar groups are examined. Preferred orientation of ferromagnetic minerals is assessed.
