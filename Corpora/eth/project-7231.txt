  Switched Antenna Array for Radio Channel Measurements  

The electromagnetic wave at the location of a stationary or mobile radio receiver can be considered  as the superposition of a number of distinct waves each of which having propagated through a different path from the transmitter to the receiver. Therefore, a complete description of the radio channel properties requires the determination of the parameters of these partial waves, i.e. their propagation delays, their azimuth and elevation angles as well as their complex amplitudes. With the aid of ECHO 24 and a new channel sounder at 5 GHz information about the complex channel impulse response may be obtained. Spatial information can be extracted by using a virtual or a real antenna array, respectively, e.g. at the receiver side. Resolution with respect to the propagation delay and direction of arrival is then achieved by processing the received signals with appropriate algorithms. The approach used in this project is to collect the necessary data by fast switching between the elements of an antenna array. Thereby, the radio channel may be considered stationary as long as the measuring period is short compared to the variations of the channel parameters. The realized UCA (uniform cross array) consists of 32 active patch antennas. PIN diode switches are used to sequentially connect the patches. The received signal at 5 GHz is coupled through a slot into strip lines to achieve the required bandwidth of 0.2 GHz. Strong efforts have been made to reduce the uncertainty in the phase information to about 5 degree and to increase the uniformity of the characteristics of the \gl/2 spaced patches by applying special geometry and by adding passive elements. High uncertainty in the phase leads to excessive clustering by the algorithms used for signal processing and nonuniformity of the gain could lead to shadowing effects.
