The aim of the EE-MFA project (EE-MFA: Economically Extended Material Flow Analysis) is to integrate information on regional economic structure into Material Flow Analysis. The expected result of the research is a method which allows environmental scientists to study the influence of economic factors on regional resource management. It is intended to create a basis for the consistent definition of indicators for resource consumption (ecological dimension of sustainability) and economic activity (economic dimension of sustainability). At the same time, it is intended to facilitate the integrated modeling of regional economic development and resource consumption. The main focus of the research activity is analysis at regional level. It involves the description of the monetary and material flows (i) on a low aggregation level (down to individual companies) and (ii) on the basis of primary data (bottom-up approach). The research work is divided into a conceptual and empirical section. In the conceptual section, a method is developed on the basis of the study of the literature and interviews with experts. This method is tested by means of case studies in the empirical section. The ALPSCAPE project is the projectSs first case study.
