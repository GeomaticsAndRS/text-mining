  Discrete FD  
The project 'discrete FD' develops and tests new computer aided forms of risk management & optimization in the field of real estate development and facility management. This will be achieved through an event based simulation for the operation and utilization as well  as the efficiency of facilities.
In the project 'discrete FD' the ETH Zurich together with its partners develops and tests new computer aided forms of risk management and optimization in the field of real estate development and facility management. The computer applications will render investments of institutional investors in real estate and offers in the field of related facility services more transparent and safe. Investments into infrastructure in the private as well as in the public sector will require fewer resources to obtain the desired effects. This will be achieved through an event based simulation for the operation and utilization as well as the efficiency of facilities. The implementation will be tested with the industrial partners SUVA, red KG and BASF Schweiz AG. These partners will provide their i.e. the D4 Business Centre in know-how and current real estate developments as test objects U Lucerne by the project leader SUVA. Project data
