System of systems is a collection of simple systems that together create a more complex system offering more functionality and performance than the constituent systems. The objective of Local4Global is to develop efficient solution methods for this class of problems  and solve practical problems.
System of systems is a collection of simple systems that together create a more complex system which offers more functionality and performance than the constituent systems. This class of problems can be cast as distributed optimization problems. The objective of Local4Global is to develop efficient solution methods for this class of problems that can be applied in practical applications such as transport, traffic and energy management systems.
