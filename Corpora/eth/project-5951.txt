  Antibody-based targeting of neo-vasculature 

 Over the last few years, in collaboration with Prof L. Zardi (Genova, Italy), we have validated the EDB domain of fibronecin and the C-domain of tenascin-C as good-quality markers of angiogenesis. We have developed high-affinity human antibodies specific for these domains, which have been tested extensively by immunohistochemistry and by biodistribution studies in animal models. In particular, the L19 antibody, specific for the EDB domain of fibronectin, has been tested in clinical trials for the last three years in Italy and Switzerland, showing a remarkable ability to localize to tumor lesions in patients with cancer. A number of derivatives of L19 have been developed in the lab (and are continuously being developed), and tested in immunocompetent animal models of angiogenesis related pathologies. These derivatives include antibody conjugated to drugs, photosensitizers, cytokines, radionuclides, pro-coagulant factors.
