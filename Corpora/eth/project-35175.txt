  The MUSE Atlas of Disks (MAD)  
The MAD project exploits our share of MUSE GTO time for a Large Program on the VLT to study the local disk galaxy population. Scientific objectives are to understand the physical triggers of star formation and the process that leads to its quenching in massive galaxies.
