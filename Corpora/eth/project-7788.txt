  Physics Performance Studies for the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeterand Detector Design Optimization 

 The performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter proposed for the CMS detector is studied using the Higgs decaying into two photons. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of the 4 Tesla magnetic field on resolution and efficiency of the crystal calorimeter. The central tracking system placed in front of the calorimeter increases the photon conversion probability, and simulation studies are needed to estimate this effect on a potential signal efficiency loss. Detailed simulation studies are also needed to tune the selection criteria for the signal and background rejection algorithms for neutral pions in order to optimize the signal significance. Overall physics performance studies are carried out which integrate the detailed information available at the sub-detector level. This integration approach is needed to identify physics signatures which require combination of different subdetectors like e.g. the missing transverse energy signature, important for Higgs discovery for larger Higgs masses and for a large variety of supersymmetric particles.
