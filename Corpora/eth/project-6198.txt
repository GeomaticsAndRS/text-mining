  A Special-Purpose Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Cable-Stayed Bridges  

 Cable-stayed bridges are today often used for bridge spans of up to 900 meters because they offer important advantages: they are self anchored, can be erected with the cantilever method and are stiffer than the suspension bridges. The design of cable-stayed bridges became possible just in the first half of the sixties, due to the progress in the computational techniques for structural analysis. Of course, cable-stayed bridges can be analysed with standard structural analysis software. This, however, is not very comfortable. In most cases these programs were not conceived for the characteristics of this bridge type which, also from an historical point of view, makes their calculation difficult. The program Bride is being developed in the context of a dissertation with the goal to keep the calculation of such bridges as simple and accurate as possible, in both the design phase and for controlling erection. To stay in contact with the needs of the industry the bridge builder Dr. Mike Schlaich is involved in the project as adviser.
