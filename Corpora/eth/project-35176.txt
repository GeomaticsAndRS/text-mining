  Novel approach to biologically control spoilage of fresh vegetables using naturally produced reuterin Project Acronym: BioControl 
Reuterin is a potent antimicrobial compound natural produced from glycerol bioconversion by Lactobacillus reuteri. We will investigate reuterin to efficiently reduce the microbial load, for shelf life extension, decreased spoilage and enhanced safety of vegetable products.
