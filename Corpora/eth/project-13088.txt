  Solar Radio Astronomy 
The project focuses on the development of a broadband Fast-Fourier-  Transform radio spectrometer using fast digital samplers and large FPGA chips in collaboration with Acqiris SA, Genf. The spectrometers can be used both for high-sensitivity solar and star formation research.
