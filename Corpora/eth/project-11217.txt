  PISA - A Platform and Programming Language Independent Interface for Search Algorithms 
This project aims at (i) developing a general interface for coupling arbitrary search algorithms with arbitrary optimization applications, (ii) designing and implementing  various search methods and benchmark problems based on this concept, and (iii) providing a Website for free software exchange.
Testing different search strategies on the same optimization problem, or applying one search method to several benchmark problems is often difficult in practice. Search strategies and application problems may be implemented in different programming languages, even on different platforms, which prevents the arbitrary combination of these components. The PISA project aims at circumventing this problem by introducing a text-based interface between the problem specific parts (e.g., representation, fitness evaluation, variation) and the problem independent parts (e.g., selection) of an application. This approach, which is especially useful in the context of multiobjective optimization, substantially reduces the re-implementation effort and allows to arbitrarily couple pre-compiled modules from either side. Besides providing executable search algorithms and various benchmark problems, the goal is to develop standardized tools that simplify the use of the PISA concept and help researchers to exchange their software packages.
