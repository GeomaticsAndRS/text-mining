  Wave Analysis of Acoustic Emission from the Single Fibre Fragmentation Test  

 Acoustic Emission (AE) is the energy released to mechanical waves duringincremental damage processes within materials. AE is used as anon-destructive tool in acceptance testing, design analysis and materialcharacterization. Fundamental understanding of the AE waves, however, islimited by the access of source information simultaneous with rigorous waveanalysis. For this reason, the single fibre fragmentation (SFFT) test hasbeen combined with AE.The SFFT is a test known to measure the adhesion properties between fibreand matrix in fibre reinforced composites. The matrix (epoxy in this case)is loaded in a tensile apparatus. A singular fibre is embedded in thematrix.The fibre is loaded through transfer of load at the fibre ends, throughshear stress at the fibre-matrix interface. As the load is raised, theaxial stress in the fibre raises until the fibre breaks. The fibre isreloaded from the two new ends. The fibre then continues to break, orfragment, until the individual fragments cannot further load the fibre tothe fibre's breaking point.Combining AE and the SFFT means that individual AE sources can beidentified and analysed in a controlled manner.
