  Point-based animation 
This research project investigates physically based modeling using points both as physical particles and as surface primitives. On the basis of this model we will simulate different materials such as elastic, plastic and viscous objects, as well as fluids.
A major goal in animation research is to simulate the behavior of real-world materials. The research concerns physically based modeling using points both as physical particles and as surface primitives. On the basis of this model we will simulate different materials such as elastic, plastic and viscous objects. Furthermore, we are addressing following problems: ) modeling phase transitions of materials such as melting, freezing, thawing and evaporation ) the interaction of different objects ) mechanical behaviors such as fracture. The main challenges are the plausible physical animation of the object and the reconstruction of the surface. Furthermore, user interaction during the animation must be possible, i.e. computation of the animation and surface reconstruction should be in interactive rate.
