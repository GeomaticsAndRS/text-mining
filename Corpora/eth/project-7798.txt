  Determination of Parton Distribution Functions and Luminosity at the LHC 

 The precise knowledge of the quark and gluon distribution functions inside the proton are essential for the interpretations of essentially all cross section measurements at the LHC. Furthermore, the number of observed events for a studied process has to be transformed into a physical cross section using the luminosity. We are currently investigating what accuracies can be obtained for the parton structure functions and their luminosity using different control processes at the LHC. Our preliminary studies show that the valence and sea quark and antiquark distributions and the corresponding luminosity can be measured accurately at the LHC using the processes of single boson production with the leptonic decays of W+, W- and Z. Combining these results with processes which are sensitive to the gluon structure, currently under study, cross section measurements and accuracies of 2% or better are achievable. Such accuracies should be compared with previous estimates of measurable accuracies of about 5-10%. Consquently the implications of such improvements for the physics potential of the LHC experiments are enormous.
