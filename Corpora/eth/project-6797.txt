  Polymers and Inorganic Materials: Adhesion and Interfaces  

 Practically all adhesives are polymeric materials. It is certain that the polymers' properties provide glue with its adhesive powers, although the mechanisms are largely unknown. We investigate the influence of certain chemical groups on the adhesion of polymers to inorganic materials. We use silicon dioxide, metals and minerals as substrates. Ultrathin layers of low- and high-molecular-weight compounds are prepared with specifically selected functional groups on the substrates. These layers are then characterized with a variety of chemical and physical methods. The results of these investigations are used as a basis for strongly binding polymers to inorganic surfaces. The adhesive energy is measured with a blister test machine employing a novel methodology developed in-house.
