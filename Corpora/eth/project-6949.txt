  Pore size and acidity engineering of M41-S materials  

Because bulky molecules have limited access to the internal pore volume of microporous materials  such as zeolites, their use as catalysts for the synthesis of fine chemicals is strictly limited. With the discovery of MCM type materials by Mobil researchers, a route was opened to overcome these constraints. Due to the significantly larger pore diameter of about 20-35 \aA, the diffusion of bigger molecules into the interior of MCM crystallites is possible, thereby making the catalytic active centers available for reaction. Their well-defined mesoporous pore structure in combination with a high surface area makes MCM-41 materials promising candidates for supports in applications requiring wide pores. The typically attainable pore diameter of about 35 \aA, however, is still too small to obtain good catalysts. Work by our group and others indicate that materials with a larger pore size can be engineered, which still belong to the M41-S but which are less ordered than MCM-41. Current research focuses on introducing strong acidity into these materials (by grafting and other methods) and making them suitable for catalytic reactions.
