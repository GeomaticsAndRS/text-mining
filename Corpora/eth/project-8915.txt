  Dynamics of tight junctions: GFP chimera and confocal laser scanning microscopy 
Understanding tight junction (TJ) regulation could help to improve drug delivery via the paracellular route. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is used in conjunction with protein analysis tools to study the TJ characteristics.
