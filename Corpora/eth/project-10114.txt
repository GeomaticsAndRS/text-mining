  MIMO wireless laboratory  
The goal of this project is to develop a broadband MIMO wireless testbed with 2 base stations and 3 terminals based on a custom hardware architecture and VLSI implementations of advanced MIMO algorithms. The project is carried out in close collaboration with IIS/ETHZ. 
Future broadband wireless access systems (BWA) such as fourth-generation (4G) mobile radio systems, fixed BWA systems (such as IEEE 802.16), and wireless LANs (such as IEEE 802.11) have much higher requirements in terms of spectral efficiency and quality of service than what is offered by current standards. Information theory shows that the use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology yields drastic improvements in terms of data rate and link reliability. Orthogonal frequency division muliplexing (OFDM) significantly reduces receiver complexity when compared to single-carrier modulation or code division multiple access (CDMA). MIMOOFDM is therefore a particularly promising candidate for future broadband wireless systems. The goal of this project is to set up a real-time MIMO wireless laboratory. At the heart of the laboratory is a small broadband MIMO wireless testbed with 2 base stations and 3 terminals based on a custom hardware architecture and VLSI implementations of advanced MIMO algorithms.
