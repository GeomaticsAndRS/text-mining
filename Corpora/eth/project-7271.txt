  Power Amplifiers for Active Magnetic Bearings  

In this project, two applications of power amplifiers for active magnetic bearings  have been studied. First, the application of a new pulse width modulation method of power amplifiers was developed for normal active magnetic bearings. The second application is the use of standard three-phase converters to supply active magnetic bearings. Active magnetic bearings require power amplifiers with high dynamics and low current harmonics. In this project, a new switching power amplifier using insulated gate bipolar transistors has been developed for the standard active magnetic bearings of a high-speed milling spindle. In this amplifier, a pulse width modulation control method using multiple switching signals is used in order to reduce the current harmonics and the switching frequency of the power switches. To control the current of the magnetic coil, a deadbeat controller and a zero-order hold are used in the current control loop. Three-phase converters and induction motors have wide applications in industry today. Using this control technique and standard components, the production of active magnetic bearings should be more economical. By superposition of the fields of two windings with p and p+1 poles respectively, a radial magnetic force can be generated. In this way, the stator of a three-phase pole-changeable motor with two independent windings may be used to build up a radial active magnetic bearing. The magnetic force can be controlled by the amplitude and phase of the three-phase current vector in one of the three-phase winding systems, while the current in another winding is used as excitation. Using this principle, an experimental active magnetic bearing supplied by a standard three-phase converter was constructed and tested.
