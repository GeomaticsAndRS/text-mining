  Using stable iron isotopic techniques and serum hepcidin profiles to optimize iron supplementation regimens for correction of iron deficiency in young women  
The aim of the project is to use of stable iron isotopes and a sensitive sHepcidin assay to investigate the iron-hepcidin relationship during iron supplementation and design more effective and safer OIS regimens.
