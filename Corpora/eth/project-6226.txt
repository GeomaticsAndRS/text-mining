  Accidents on High-Volume Freeways  

For some time the number of traffic accidents on freeways has increased every  year, in some cases more than proportional compared to the traffic volumes. Since freeways are built to high standards, the causes of these accidents in most cases are not related to the facility but have to be looked for in traffic flow and/or traffic behavior. The aims of this study are firstly to identify those causes in order to develop measures to prevent the circumstances later on leading to accidents. Secondly to identify measures for pertinent traffic surveillance and as a base for traffic (influencing) guiding systems. In order to provide a sufficiently large test-data base it is planned to undertake a campaign of extensive video filming of traffic flow on existing freeways.
