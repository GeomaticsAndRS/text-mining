  Reducing excess sludge production in wastewater treatment through endogenous biological processes 
The goal of this project is to evaluate mechanisms that can increase the degradability of particulate organic matter and reduce overall sludge production in biological wastewater treatment systems by influencing microbial metabolism under starvation conditions.
