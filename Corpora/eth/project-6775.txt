Corrosion resistance and the ability to harden by a diffusionless phase transformation is the metallurgical character for this group of steels. Beneficial combinations of mechanical properties are achieved by precipitation processes in an extraordinarily complex and recovering  substructure. Microstructural control of the phase transformations and the softening mechanisms during tempering and creep is the subject of this project. Creep softening processes are analysed by quantifying the thermal and stress affected degradation of the microstructure with transmission electron microscopy. A newly developed metallurgical system of the high nitrogen variant is used to analyse the effect of dispersed nitrides on the martensitic phase transformation and its relation to strength of martensite and tempering response. A second group of 9-12% Cr steels is developed for high creep strength and fracture toughness. Its microstructure consists of a tight arrangement of interlocked subgrainboundaries being stabilized by a dispersion of fine particles (carbides, nitrides, carbonitrides, intermetallic compound) grown together with the boundary dislocation networks. The goal is to provide a new class of 9-12% Cr steels for steam turbines with a steam inlet temperature higher than 600\dgC and also to provide new gas turbine rotor steels.
