  Constraint-Driven Computational Design Synthesis using Graph Grammars  
This research focuses on topologic and parametric computational synthesis for engineering design problems defined through requirements. Object-oriented graph grammars  are combined with Boolean satisfiability, constraint solving and simulation to automatically generate and explore solution spaces.
