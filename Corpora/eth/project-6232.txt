  Circular Test Track IVT: Test No. 5, Thin Bituminous Layers on Stabilized BaseCourses  

 With the fifth full-scale accelerated test on the IVT test-facility in Dübendorf six different pavement structures were tested at the same time and under the same load and environment conditions. The different sections were constructed as follows: - two bituminous layers (4/6 cm) on top of 14 cm bituminous stabilized base course with 50% recycled material, constructed as a hot mix (HMF) - two bituminous layers (4/6 cm) on top of 14 cm bituminous stabilized base course with 70 to 100% recycled material, constructed as a cold mix (KMF) - two bituminous layers (4/6 cm) on top of 14 cm bituminous stabilized base course with 70 to 100% recycled material, constructed as a cold mix (KMF), but with a different bituminous binder than the other sections - 2,0/3,5 cm bituminous layers on top of 26,0/24,5 cm concrete cement course - 4,0/8,0 cm bituminous layers on top of 24,0/20,0 cm concrete cement course - 4,0 cm bituminous surface layer, 8,0 cm bituminous stabilized base course with 70 to 100% recycled material, constructed as a cold mix (KMF) on top of 30 cm crushed gravel 0/63. The results of extensive measurements and observations should lead to guiding principles for the design of pavement structures using recycled materials.
