  Foods from poultry resistant to oxidation: Determination of the efficiency of unconventional feeds and of the underlying mechanisms  

Food derived from poultry is typically rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Therefore rancidity caused by lipid oxidation needs special attention. This process can be retarded by adding antioxidants to the animal diet or the processed product. Concerns over health hazards of synthetic compounds arouse the interest for natural antioxidants provided by certain plants or their extracts. However, the limited knowledge about herbaceous antioxidants, if available at all, often stems from the human medicine or other animal species. Some of the substances in question for their antioxidative properties may also possess a coloring effect on the egg yolk. The present research focuses on the identification of hitherto unknown dietary supplements that delay the lipid oxidation in poultry products (meat, egg, and fat tissue) in a natural way. This should outline ways to further improve the quality standard of poultry products or create a notable special quality in label programs. Furthermore, the possible dual efficiency in acting antioxidative and coloring egg yolk will be investigated in broilers and laying hens. Properties related to lipid oxidation will be measured in feed, meat, fat tissue, and eggs.
