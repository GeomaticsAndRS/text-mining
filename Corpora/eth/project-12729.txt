  Usage of Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) Fibre as Slurry Wall Reinforcement Material for the Two-Phase-Process  
Slurry walls are a relatively brittle material, which only small tensions with small deformations can take up. On basis of these realizations an armouring was made by means of PVA-fibres. Through this process an improvement of the mechanical characteristics of the material could have been achieved.
