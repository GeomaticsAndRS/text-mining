  Feature selection 
Our aim is to extend the feature selection of the LASSO to the nonGaussian case.  We formulate a notion of "irrelevance" of variables, and show that the LASSO will not select these variables with large probability.
Recent work has shown that in the Gaussian linear model, the LASSO can find the relevant features for prediction, provided the smoothing parameter is chosen carefully (i.e., not following a standard cross-validation procedure). Our aim is to extend this to the non-Gaussian case. We have formulated a notion of "irrelevance" of variables, and shown that also in other models, the LASSO will not select these variables with large probability.
