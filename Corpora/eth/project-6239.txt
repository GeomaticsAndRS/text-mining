  Supercritical flow in junction manholes  

Manholes with supercritical flow in both upstream branches having either a 45\dg or a 90\dg lateral  branch were considered (see also SUPERCRITICAL FLOW IN BEND MANHOLES). In contrast to bend manholes, junction manholes are less critical in terms of discharge capacity, because the upstream branch re-directs the lateral branch flow. The discharge capacity of the novel junction manhole as expressed with a pipe Froude number is equal to about 1.4, thus 40% larger than for the bend manhole. The novel design for deflection angles between 45\dg and 90\dg has the following manhole features: (1) Effective deflection 45\dg, and additional upstream deflection separated by a straight U-shaped connection of length 1 diameter, (2) Manhole extension of two diameters before entering downstream sewer, (3) Manhole bench only along inner manhole side, (4) Relative curvature three sewer diameters, as for bend manholes. In contrast to current sewer design, the maximum filling ratio for both upstream branches is limited to 60%, because choking occurs otherwise. Conditions of flow breakdown due to dominant branch flow were also investigated, as also flows in only one branch. The novel design allows to discharge supercritical flow across junction manholes without risk for choking, provided the conditions mentioned are satisfied.
