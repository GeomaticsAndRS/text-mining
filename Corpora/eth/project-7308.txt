  OpenMaX, an Open Source Graphic Multi-Method Maxwell Solver  
Graphic platform for computational electromagnetics codes with advanced tools for modeling, visualization, animation. Contains analytic solvers, latest version of the Multiple Multipole Program (MMP), Finite Difference Tome Domain (FDTD), etc. Open Source  project.
OpenMaX is a graphic platform for visualizing electromagnetic fields on regular and irregular grids. It contains various procedures for computing the fields with different analytic, semi-analytic, and numeric methods as well as features for linking external Maxwell solvers. OpenMaX can be embedded in an optimization environment that allows one to perform internal and external optimizations. OpenMaX contains the latest versions of the 2D and 3D Multiple Multipole Programs (MMP). It runs on personal computers under Windows. It can handle many different problems, including electrostatics, electromagnetic scattering, guided waves, resonators, gratings, photonic band gap structures, photonic crystal waveguides, waveguide discontinuities, and antennas. OpenMaX is an Open Source project based on the MaX-1 software package.
