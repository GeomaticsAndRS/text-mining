  INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE VARIABILITY ON THE DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURE OF OLD-GROWTH TEMPERATE RAINFORESTS  
This project will examine relationships between climate and forest structure and composition through an integrated study combining multi-century climate reconstructions,  forest disturbance histories, and forest succession models along environmental gradients in temperate rainforests.
