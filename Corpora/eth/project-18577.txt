  High performance convective liquid cooling of electronics with nature-inspired microchannel networks filled with nanoparticle suspensions  
The increase in transistor density of microprocessors involves high thermal loads, requiring enhanced cooling. In this project a novel cooling device will be developed  with a tree-like microchannel system to increase heat transfer and minimize pressure drop for a coolant with added nanoparticles.
