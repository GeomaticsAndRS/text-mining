  Man Machine Interaction - Communication: Perceived quality of net-mediated communication  

 Quality of Service (QoS) Expectations for Real-Time Dialog Communication (QED). QED is a project exploring the range of suitable QoS parameters (like delay and other impairments) for interpersonal real-time communication in large distributed systems. The relevant QoS parameters are evaluated and subjective tests are made for a set of application scenarios in order to identify an acceptable range of QoS parameters for the user.
