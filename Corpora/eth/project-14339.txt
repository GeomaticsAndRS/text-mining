  Synthesis and biological evaluation of new epothilone analogs  
Epothilones are microtubule-stabilizing agents with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. This project is directed at the synthesis and biological assessment of new  potent epothilone analogs (as potential drug candidates per se) as well as targeted prodrugs and tool compounds.
