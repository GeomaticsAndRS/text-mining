  UltraVR - Ultrasound Imaging Simulation for Virtual Reality Training  
Ultrasound imaging is a low-cost, real-time, non-ionizing image modality. The interpretation of ultrasound images with concurrent manipulation of ultrasound transducer is, however, a complex task requiring substantial training, which is addressed hereby via virtual reality simulation of images. 
The main scientific objectiv of this project is to develop ultrasound simulation techniques capable of a level of realism beyond the current stat of the art in order to be acceptable by sonographers for virtual reality based training of ultrasound examinations. In line with our focus on OB GYN applications we will primarily target the two different ultrasound examination techniques used in OB GYN: abdominal ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound. The former is an external imaging technique used in OB GYN for imaging the reproductive system and fetus during pregnangcy; whereas the latter is an edocavity imaging technique used commonly in gynaecological examinations. Between these two imagingn techniques there are fundamental differences: the transducer geometries, the filed of views possible range of dirfferent view directions and tissue deformations that can be induced.
