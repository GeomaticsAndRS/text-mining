  Intraarticular Synovial Fluid Flow: Implications for Cartilage Lubrication  
The influence of cartilage micro-roughness, joint separation and synovial fluid properties on intra-articular (gap) fluid flow is determined through computer simulation and experimental methods. Insights gained will direct future prosthesis design and cartilage tissue engineering methods.
