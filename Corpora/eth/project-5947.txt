  Gating of Ion Channels  

Ligand-gated ion channels are heteromeric membrane-spanning receptors  which, upon binding of an agonist, permit the flow of cations or anions through the cell membrane. NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the brain are of particular interest since they require an agonist (glutamate) as well as a co-agonist (glycine) to operate. The types of subunits and the molecular determinants for the agonist- and co-agonist sites will be identified by photo-affinity ligands for both sites. The project aims to determine the molecular components and their interplay by which the opening of the ion channel is induced.
