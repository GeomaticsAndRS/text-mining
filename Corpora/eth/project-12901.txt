  Swiss glacier monitoring network  
The Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network is a joint project by the Section of Glaciology of VAW/ETHZ and the Glaciological Commission of the Swiss Academy of Sciences (SAS) in which changes of Swiss glaciers are monitored since 125 years. 
Glacier variations reflect changes in climate. Fluctuations in glacier length and changes in volume and mass of glaciers represent key parameters in environmental monitoring. The Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network is a joint project by the Section of Glaciology of VAW/ETHZ and the Glaciological Commission of the Swiss Academy of Sciences (SAS). The aim is the longterm monitoring of changes of the glaciers in the Swiss Alps. Seasonal to annual measurements of the glacier length, the mass balance and the flow velocity are performed. Thanks to ongoing investigations long and continuous time series have been collected.
