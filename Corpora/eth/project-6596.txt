  PowerDB-IR  

The combination of DBMS functionality with information retrieval (IR) is necessary to  deal with the ever growing masses of information. A respective system must support seeking relevant information as well as reliable and concurrent processing and updating according to the state-of-the-art with databases. Within this project we design, implement, and evaluate PowerDB-IR, a prototype for document retrieval and data management. PowerDB-IR is a coordination layer for a large database cluster. It uses modern off-the-shelf infrastructures. We build on composite transactions to support high-level parallelism and on IR-to-database mappings. We follow a three-tier architecture with a database cluster as the bottom layer for storage management. Using a cluster is a key factor for "scaling out" performance. The middle tier consists of specialized components providing IR-specific processing and update services. Object transaction monitors coordinate the cluster and invoke IR-specific components. PowerDB-IR takes care of global concurrency and recovery. It decomposes long IR services and IR transactions into concurrent short database transactions. We compare alternatives for physical design, aiming at different workloads. Focusing on providing a scalable infrastructure for IR, PowerDB-IR has the following features: It supports both Boolean and vector space retrieval on the same data. It allows to concurrently insert documents and ensures freshness with almost no overhead. It surprisingly shows ideal scalability and low response times.
