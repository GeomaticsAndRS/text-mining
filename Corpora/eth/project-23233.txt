  GlazioPOP: Fate of and release from persistent organic chemicals in glaciers  
Persistent chemicals that were incorporated into Alpine glaciers in the 1960s and 1970s are currently released as a consequence of accelerated retreating glaciers caused by warming climate. The fate of the chemicals in Alpine glaciers is investigated with field measurements and modeling studies.
