  Conservation genetics of the endangered stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium)  
The native stone crayfish is endangered due to habitat degeneration, the invasion of exotic crayfish species and a deadly disease, the crayfish plague. The genetic structure of remaing stone crayfish populations is studied to inform their conservation and guide reintroduction efforts.
