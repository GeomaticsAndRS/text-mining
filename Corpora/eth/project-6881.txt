  Development of tunable extreme ultraviolet lasers in the wavelength range 30 - 130 nm 

No tunable lasers are commercially available in the wavelength range 30-130 nm. Tunable radiation in this range can be obtained in synchrotron facilities. Although synchrotron radiation sources offer the advantages of broad and easy tunability, the radiation bandwidth is limited to at best 1 cm-1 beyond 100'000 cm-1 (= 100 nm) and the cost of national synchrotron facilities is considerable. This project concentrates on alternative methods of generating narrow bandwidth tunable radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV). We use nonlinear optical techniques and convert the frequency of tunable pulsed visisble or ultraviolet nanosecond lasers into the XUV. The duration of the laser pulses (3 - 10 ns) enables bandwidth of 0.01 cm-1 to be obtained beyond 100'000 cm-1 . Our XUV laser sources currently extend from 50'000 cm-1 (200 nm) to 160'000 cm-1 (66 nm) and progress is being made to reach even further in the XUV. Recently a new broadly tunable all-solid-state VUV laser producing Fourier-transform-limited pulses of programmable pulse shape and duration has been developed, enabling VUV spectra to be recorded at a resolution of 0.003 cm-1 (90 MHz). Keywords: Broadly tunable VUV lasers, Fourier-transform-limited VUV lasers, narrow-bandwidth VUV radiation, extreme ultraviolet. References: H. Palm and F. Merkt, Appl. Phys. Lett. 73, 157 (1998); F.
