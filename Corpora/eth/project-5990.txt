  Zurzach, Historical-archaeological Land Register  

This project will be continued without change in methods or scope. It will, to an increasing  measure, be treated by CAD. Major progress has been made in registering the written sources (primarily done by Alfred Hidber in his spare time). The documentation will be systematically revised for EDV. State of the work by subject area: In addition to the house facades and major streets, each of the side streets is now largely included. The number of dendrochronologically dated buildings and modifications can be substantially increased. In the upper village ("Oberflecken"), the systematic measurement of the ground-floor outline plan is substantially completed. Place: Zurzach
