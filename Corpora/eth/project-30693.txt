  Methods of seismic response modification based on rocking of structures  
Objects that uplift without overturning often experience minimal damage during earthquakes. This research project aims to develop the dynamics theory and the analysis  tools able to describe the uplifting and rocking phenomena in structures made using deformable structural elements.
It has been shown that large objects excited by earthquakes can uplift and undergo rocking motion and drastically limits without overturning. Moreover, their uplifting works as a Smechanical ¸ fuseT the forces transmitted to the structure. These facts have lead earthquake engineers to apply rocking as a seismic response modification technique. The South Rangitikei railway bridge in New Zealand, as well as several chimneys in Christchurch, New Zealand were designed to uplift and rock: they performed well during the 2011 series of strong earthquakes. Furthermore, ancient Greek and Roman temples, that have survived for more than 2.5 millennia are rocking structures. Rocking has the potential of being widely applied in earthquake-resistant prefabricated bridges and buildings. This research project aims to develop analysis tools, in the framework of the Finite Element Method, able to describe the complex uplifting and rocking phenomena in structures. These tools are to be used to explore the seismic performance of rocking (posttensioned or not) deformable structures. Two modeling approaches are examined: a) Rocking interfaces are modeled as bilinear link elements and damping is introduced with concentrated viscous dampers. b) Rocking interfaces are modeled with fiber elements. Damping is introduced by numerically damping out the high frequency vibrations generated at each impact.
