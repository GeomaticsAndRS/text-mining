  KTI 17136.1 Geometric and Semantic Structuring of 3D point clouds  
The topic of the proposed project is the automation of point cloud interpretation for terrestrial surveying applications.
The topic of the proposed project is the automation of point cloud interpretation for terrestrial surveying applications. More specifically, the project will develop methods to automatically assign individual points in the cloud to a semantic category or subcategories (such as vegetation, building, etc. or windows and doors), and to detect and reconstruct break lines, i.e. surface discontinuities such as road embankments, roof edges, wall footprints etc. in the data.
