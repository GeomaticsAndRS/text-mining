  SmartShunt - The Hydrocephalus Project  
This multidisciplinary research project aims at conducting the basic research necessary for the subsequent development of a smart cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).
Based on the former project (ID 8606) TBiothermofluidics for Cerebrospinal Fluid Diagnostics and Control - Development of a Knowledge BaseT, this multidisciplinary research project aims at conducting the basic research necessary for the subsequent development of a smart cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is most commonly treated by the surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that drains CSF from the patient's ventricular space to the peritoneal area. Current shunts rely on differential-pressure valves to control CSF drainage. The goals of the project are: coupling of brain and spinal cord mechanics with CSF flow, investigation of CSF flow and pressure in pathological cases such as hydrocephalus and research on an intelligent CSF shunt for hydrocephalus.
