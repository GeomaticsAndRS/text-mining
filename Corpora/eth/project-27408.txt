  Bio2Man4MRI 
Magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) are key components in the development of novel nano- and biotechnologies. Magnetosomes are unique hybrid magnetic MNP produced by magnetotactic bacteria (MB). In this EU project we are responsible for the magnetic characterization of the MB and biomimetic MNP.
