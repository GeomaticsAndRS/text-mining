  Genetic determinants of adaptive variation and their evolution in structured populations ­ follow-up  
How do species adapt to current shifts in their environment? What are the factors that limit or enhance species adaptation to climatic changes? I am addressing these broad questions with a mix of modeling and experimental approaches using computer simulations and experimental evolution in Tribolium.
