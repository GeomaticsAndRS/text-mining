  Data-driven tools for accelarating pharmaceutical development  
The objective is to show the versatile applicability of data-driven tools at different stages of the pharmaceutical development. The advantages of their implementation shall be proved starting from designing optimal screening experiments to multivariate model-based process control and scale-up.
The focus of the project is on process development and optimization for the production of monoclonal antibodies. Taking into account both characteristic stages, the upstream (expansion and fermentation) as well as the downstream (capture and purification), the effect of process parameters on the product quality is evaluated with a focus on Design of Experiments and Multivariate Data Analysis. In combination with the knowledge from experimental investigation and deterministic models those techniques are used to define an optimal dynamic sampling scheme, to enable robust (online) process monitoring and predictive process control, amongst other progressive engineering tools. A versatile statistical engineering platform shall be developed to support and accelerate the process development ranging from optimal design of screening experiments to scale-up using characteristic process fingerprints.
