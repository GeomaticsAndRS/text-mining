  Searches for Physics Phenomena beyond the standard Model  
The proton-proton collider LHC covers a completely new energy regime, up to 14 TeV centre of mass energy. The project aims to search for signs of new physics beyond the standard model, such as the occurence of new particles or deviations from the  SM theory.
