  Identification of the Binding Site of Neuropeptide Y to its Receptors 

 The 36-amino acid neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one of the most abundant peptides in the peripheral and central nervous system. So far, at least two subtypes of NPY receptors have been described (Y1, Y2) using segments and analogues of NPY. The Y1 receptor, which has been cloned recently, belongs to the G-protein coupled hormone receptor family and the NPY induced activities vasoconstriction, food uptake and anxiolysis are transmitted by this subtype. In order to identify the NPY binding site, we synthesize photoreactive analogues of NPY, radiolabel them and use those to characterize the receptor. Using 50 analogues of neuropeptide Y, each containing of 36 amino acids, we could identify the importance of each residue of neuropeptide Y for receptor binding and suggest an active conformation according to 3D models of the ligand. The interaction with the receptor can be further characterized using anti-receptor antibodies and receptor mutants. A model for the interaction is suggested. The binding site of neuropeptide Y was compared to the binding site of the first non-peptide Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP 3226. The identification of a partial overlapping of the binding sites allows the rational approach from peptide ligands to non peptide antagonists.
