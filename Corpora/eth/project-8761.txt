  Fundamentals and Applications of Graphical Models  
Most of our research is somehow related to graphical models (factor graphs) and to message passing algorithms on such graphs. Topics include adaptation and learning,  applied signal processing, modeling physical systems, and more.
Most of our research is somehow related to graphical models (factor graphs) and to message passing algorithms on such graphs. We are interested in a wide variety of conceptual and algorithmical issues. Examples include - applications to practical signal processing problems - adaptation and learning - local formulation of Kalman filtering, expectation maximization, particle methods, etc. - improved message passing with structured summaries - electrical networks and other physical systems as factor graphs - Fourier and Lagrange duality.
