  Glycerol oxidation to dihydroxyacetone over iron zeolites  
The increasing amounts of glycerol obtained as the main by-product of  biodiesel production is motivating the identification of viable processes for its valorization. In this project, we target the generation of C3 polymer building blocks through a high-productivity gasphase oxidationof the triol ov
Amongst the monomers targeted in the valorization of crude glycerol, the partial oxidation product dihydroxyacetone (DHA) attracts particular interest. In fact, its terminal hydroxyl groups make it a suitable molecule for copolymerization with a dicarboxylic acid. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that it can be converted by isomerization into lactic acid, which can be polymerized into polylactic acid or further converted into high-volume chemical intermediates such as acrylates. In this project, the selective oxidation of glycerol to DHA was studied in a continuous gas-phase reactor over iron-containing catalysts in the presence of molecular oxygen. A series of materials displaying zeolitic or amorphous structure, different Brønsted and Lewis-acid sites concentration and strength, and distinct iron species were synthesized, characterized by a multi-technique approach, and evaluated. Fe-silicalite prepared by isomorphous substitution of iron in the all-silica framework followed by steam activation at 873 K was identified as the best catalyst owing to its very mild acidity and high degree of iron dispersion. This catalyst displayed a stable DHA yield of ca. 90% under optimized reaction conditions, thus largely surpassing the expensive noble metalbased catalysts reported to date. Interestingly, our study also uncovers the first oxidation reaction over iron zeolites in which molecular oxygen is a suitable oxidant and the typically applied N2O is ineffective.
