  Tumor Tracking with Treatment Table  
Improvement of Radiotherapy by compensating the tumor motion of the patient using the treatment table, which moves in the opposite direction. This allows avoiding irradiation of healthy tissue, which in turn allows higher irradiation of tumors.
Radiotherapy uses ionizing radiation to treat tumor patients. The ionization destroys the DNA of the cells and should therefore only be deposited in the tumor tissue. A robotic treatment table is normally used for exact static positioning of the patient. This works well with static tumors, but some tumors move, e.g. lung tumors due to respiration. In these cases, the target volume to be irradiated is enlarged, such that the tumor is always inside this volume, resulting in an increase of irradiation of healthy tissue. Here, in collaboration with the UniversityHospital Zurich, an alternative method, real time tumor tracking, is investigated. Tumor Tracking allows reduction of the needed enlargement of the target volume, by compensating the motion of the tumor. The compensation is carried out via the treatment table, which moves the patient in the opposite direction of the tumor motion. Thus the tumor moves little relative to the beam.
