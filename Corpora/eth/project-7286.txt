  Design and Technology of Monolithically Integrated Photoreceiversfor 20 Gbit/s Data Transmission  

 Photoreceivers for bitrates higher than 10 Gbit/s require the monolithic integration of a photodiode and an amplifier. This project focuses on the fabrication of a monolithically integrated photoreceiver for data rates up to 20 Gbit/s. A flat photoresponse with a bandwidth of 18 GHz, a transimpedance of 300 Ohm and an average spectral input noise current of 12pA/Hz**0.5 have been achieved. The receiver can be tuned up to 22 GHz with a 3 dB gain peak by adjusting bias voltages. An open eye-diagram with a sensitivity of -16.8 dBm was achieved for a 10 Gbit/s NRZ signal. The large bandwidth of the receiver is sufficient for data rates up to 30 Gbit/s. In terms of high speed and low noise, the circuits fabricated in this project demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for OEIC receivers.
