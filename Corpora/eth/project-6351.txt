  Man Machine Interaction - Distributed collaborative work: Communicate-It  

Video conferencing systems are today rarely used for distributed collaborative design tasks - even  by companies which already employ such a system. Due to a number of technical and conceptional weaknesses people still prefer long travelling hours to achieve physical contact. This project addresses the fundamental problems inherent in current technology by devoting attention to psychological and technological problems. Psychological problems include communicating who is talking to whom and who would like to talk to whom next, communicating the relevant information about the (shared) work space, about the state of attention and involvement of the members of a group, and communicating about the emotional reactions to propositions in a discussion. The general goal of this project is the optimization of man-intermediate-man-interaction (MIMI) within the (technical) constraints of current network technology. To reach this goal the project will start with a field study investigating which modes of communication are relevant for man-man interaction in collaborative design. A number of laboratory experiments shall reveal which of these modes also are relevant for distributed collaborative design. A special point of interest will be the possibility of a shared workspace which, apart from the advantage of increased information, has the possibility to focus on the (economic) transmission of locations of tools within the shared work space rather than the (expensive) transmission of visual data. The results of the field study and the laboratory experiments will be used to design and implement a teleconferencing system, which is optimized for MIMI. Implementation will make use of the newest technology such as alternative display methods and intuitive interaction tools as demonstrated with BUILD-IT\reg, a system based on augmented reality developed at the ETH.
