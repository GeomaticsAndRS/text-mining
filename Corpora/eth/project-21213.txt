  Effect of cyanide-mineral interactions on granite weathering in a glacier forefield  
This research addresses the biogeochemical weathering processes in postglacial alpine areas. The goal is to gain insights into the role and mechanisms of the initial weathering of primary rock forming minerals with special emphasis on cyanide as ligand and complexing  agent.
