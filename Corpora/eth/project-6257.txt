  THREE DIMENSIONAL NUMERICAL SIMULATIOIN OF SCOURING AND BRAIDED RIVERS  

For appropriate width, slope and discharge braiding rivers form in nature. Morphologic processes  are vital for the dynamic motion of the river bed. These processes are amplified along river curves and around bridge piers and may cause instabilities of slopes and traffic infrastructure. A correct simulation of such bed changes is only possible if velocity, suspended bedload and sedimentology are correctly matched by a numerical tool. From a numerical point of view the project is challenging as it involves two moving boundaries, namely the sediment surface of the river bed and the water surface. The computational model developed within the framework of the current research project can be used as a sophisticated expert tool for complex river engineering problems.
