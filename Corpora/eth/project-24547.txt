  Idioms of Exclusion: The Hybrid Babu vs the Authentic Indian in Colonial India  

Manufactured in the imperial laboratory of colonial Bengal, the Babus embodied all the negative ´ implications of colonial mimicry, particularly as SembodiedS in their clothing and consumption habits. The widely consumed stereotype representation of the Babu (particularly in contemporary folk paintings, literature and street songs) was used as a figure of critique both by the British colonial masters and the traditional Indian nationalist for their respective purposes throughout the nineteenth century. This study aims to address three main themes: Discourses on professional and private worlds of Babus, and the tensions they reveal between the colonial rulers and the colonized, marked out through Indian practices of assimilation and rejection of the West. The formation and dynamics of a consumer identity through domestication of the West. Indian as a counter-image to the hybrid Sassimilated Discourses on the ideal of the Sauthentic ¸ T ¸ T. Current historiographies on Babus have rarely dwelt on their consumer behaviour. Much of the literature is concerned with the social circumstances, disciplines, and colonial politics associated with this stereotyped figure. Through an in-depth empirical research and conceptual framework, this study aims to fulfill the existing vacuum. In doing so, it will suitably negotiate the larger pro ject: SAssimilation, ¸ Mimicry and AuthenticityT. This project will emerge as an interesting field for studying the interplay of different paradigms of assimilation, mimicry and authenticity among the colonial Indian middle class, an issue which is of great relevance, perhaps even more today than ever before, due to the emerging consumerist consciousness and hybrid national-global identities practised by the Indian middle classes in the age of neo-liberalism.
