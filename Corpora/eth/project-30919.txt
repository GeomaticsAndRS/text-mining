  Experimental investigation of Aeroacoustic and wake field of a full scale wind farm using UAV  
The scope of this project consists of measurement of aero acoustic and wake field generated by a full scale wind farm under different terrain and wind conditions. The  need for reliable data is to advance the understanding of the wake evolution and aero acoustic field dissipation from a wind farm.
