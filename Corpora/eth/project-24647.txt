The aim of this project is to convert lignin into value-added chemicals, such as phenols and aromatic aldehydes, by fast pyrolysis and catalytic conversion. With the aim to stabilize the intermediate products, we will unravel the reaction mechanism of fast pyrolysis and control the reaction through adding selected catalysts, such as acids, bases, and metals.
