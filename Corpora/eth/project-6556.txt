  Growth Relation and Regeneration Dynamics of Coppice with Standards  

 Experimental plots on which this historic form of silviculture is practised according to the old silvicultural techniques. Different volumes of standards and their effects on the development of the coppice are maintained and studied. The natural regeneration of oak and other light demanding trees as well as their mortality under different degrees of crown closure are followed. The dynamic of both standards and coppice are monitored. The main goal of the experiment, beside the ecological objectives, is to maintain this historic form of treatment for teaching purposes. Linked with the experimental plots are different kinds of studies on birds and small animals.
