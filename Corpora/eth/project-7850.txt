  Thin Organic Films Studied by Non-linear and Linear Optical Techniquesas well as Atomic Force Microscopy 

 The optical and structural properties of ultra thin organic molecular films are both essential for the potential applications in optical wave guide structures and filters. One method, the so-called Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique, allows the 2-dimensional aggregation of LB molecules on both solid and the water surface. The most outstanding advantage of this technique is the direct control of molecular assembly processes on the molecular level. We therefore set up optical techniques for both the in-situ and ex-situ investigation of mono- and multilayer LB films. Linear optical (polarization) and non-linear optical (second-harmonic) microscopy complement our scanning probe techniques which are sensitive to the molecular assembly at the sample surface. In addition a scanning force microscope (SFM) has been developed that is able to investigate even the liquid/air interface in order to analyse a floating LB monolayer. Optical and structural analysis has been applied to a variety of new LB molecules which have been synthesized to yield a high value for the non-linear optical susceptibility \gc$^{(2)}$. Film transfer processes onto solid substrates have been studied and structural optimization was achieved. As a result, the optical losses in such LB film wave guides could be reduced.
