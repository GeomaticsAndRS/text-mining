  Judicial Governance in Global Trade Relations  
This project investigates the initiation and escalation dynamics of WTO trade disputes and the compliance behavior of countries with regard to WTO dispute settlement  rulings.
This project focuses on the initiation and escalation dynamics of WTO trade disputes and the compliance behavior of countries with regard to WTO dispute settlement rulings. The project has two parts. Dispute initiation and escalation dynamics: In this part of the project we focus on how legal capacity affects WTO dispute initiation, to what extent so called gravitation effects account for dispute initiation, and whether dispute escalation dynamics differ across types of disputed trade issues (e.g. between environment, health, and safety issues and other issues). Compliance with dispute settlement rulings: In this part of the project we are interested in the effects of political system variables (e.g. democracy, veto-players, ideological orientation), trade issue types (e.g. anti-dumping vs. environment, health and safety issues), and economic factors (e.g. compliance costs, trade interdependence, level of development, legal capacity)on compliance behavior of countries involved in WTO dispute settlement. This project is undertaken in the framework of the NCCR Trade. More information is available at: www.nccr-trade.org/
