  Experimental investigation and modeling of the droplet deformation in a computer-controlled flow cell in the presence of surface-active materials  
Within a newly developed computer controlled parallel band flow apparatus, deformation and break up behaviour of newtonian / non-Newtonian droplets in steady and  transient shear flows with surfactant covered interfaces are investigated. Interfacial tension and rheological properties are derived.
