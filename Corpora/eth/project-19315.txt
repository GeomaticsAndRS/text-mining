  ValueLab  
The Value Lab is a research and teaching facility. The Lab consists of a high-resolution wall with three large flat screens, an interactive table, all equipped with specialised  simulation software. The Value Lab can be used, in example for the cooperative design of future cities.
The Value Lab is designed for lectures and workshops which rely on different kinds of interactive information visualization. These visualizations can be shared around the world through a Video Conferencing System and/or a Podcasting System. Furthermore the Value Lab on its own is part of an ongoing research on how to integrate leading edge technology. Therefore it is an open infrastructure to add value to existing technology.
