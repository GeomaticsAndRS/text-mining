  Tragverhalten von gestossenen Biegetr√§gern aus Verbundsicherheitsglas / Load bearing behavior of sliced structural glass beams  
Sliced structural glass beams do not have a constant cross section over  their length. Consequentially, stress concentrations occur in the region of joints. The main aim of this project is to develop a model to estimate the maximal principal stress that occurs in the beam.
