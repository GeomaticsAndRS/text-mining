  Topological phases and quantum computing  
Besides classical order with broken symmetries, quantum systems can exhibit topological order, characterized by nonlocal topological quantities. Besides their rich properties and deep connections to the topology of 2-manifolds, toplogical order can be used for robust quantum computation.
