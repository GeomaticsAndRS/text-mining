  Nonlinear optic characterization of multiferroic LuMnO3 thin films  
SHG analysis of the coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders in the orthorhombic thin films. 
Thin LuMnO3 are grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The influence of strain in this candidate multiferroic compound is investigated. In this system, strain induced ferromagnetism is expected. Optical second harmonic generation (SHG) is used to probe the existence of a polar state in the thin film in a wide range of temperature. The coexistence on ferromagnetism is investigation using neutron scattering.
