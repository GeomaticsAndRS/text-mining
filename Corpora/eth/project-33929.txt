  Spatial Impulse Waves  
Rock falls, landslides, shore instabilities, or snow avalanches may generate large water waves in oceans, bays, lakes, or reservoirs. The spatial propagation characteristics of these so-called impulse waves are investigated within this project to derive calculation fomulae  for hazard assessment.
Rock falls, landslides, shore instabilities, or snow avalanches may generate large water waves in oceans, bays, lakes, or reservoirs. These impulse waves, also referred to as tsunami-type waves, involve long-wave characteristics and may run-up the shoreline or overtop a dam, endangering thereby adjacent settlements and infrastructure. The hydraulic processes related to landslide generated impulse waves have been extensively investigated at VAW during the past decades by means of physical scale model experiments. A set of governing dimensionless parameters was derived from the results. They include the slide Froude number F, the relative slide thickness S, the relative slide mass M and the slide impact angle . These parameters are relevant for the description of the characteristics of the generated waves, and govern the so-called impulse wave parameter P describing the main wave features. The previous research studies at VAW mainly focused on the investigation of a vertical twodimensional experimental set-up in a laboratory flume. The primary objective of the current project is to study wave generation and propagation due to a granular slide impact within a threedimensional model basin. A state-of-the-art videometry system is applied for tracking and analyzing the temporal and spatial wave surface patterns. Main goals: - Investigating impulse wave patterns in a three-dimensional model basin - Quantifying the effects on wave generation and propagation by varying selected parameters - Extending existing formulas with three-dimensional calculation parameters
