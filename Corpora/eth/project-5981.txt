  Decay, Weathering and Conservation of Monuments made of stony materials  
This work is object and practice oriented. Processes of decay are traced through continuous observation and analysis, accompanied by measurement (climatic parameters) and laboratory experiments. This enables the determination of specific, controlled and individually adapted conservation actions
