  Biodegradable Polymers for Medicine  

 In medicine, plastics find widespread use as permanent implants or as temporary service devices. The great advantage of biodegradable polymers is that after fulfilling their task, they are eliminated through natural pathways. This renders unnecessary a second operation to remove non-degradable devices. Currently, the choice of medical-grade clinically approved plastics is small and does not fulfill the many requirements of medical practice. We therefore synthesize potentially degradable block-polymers on the basis of polyethers and polyesters, chain-extended with urethane, ester, or carbonate linkages, and vary their properties over a wide range via their composition. Experiments have demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and easily adjustable degradability, in vitro and in vivo, for materials with widely variable mechanical behavior and good processability.
