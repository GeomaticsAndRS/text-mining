  Alpine Climate Change  

 The present and future climate of the Alpine region is in effect the response to, and the modification of, the prevailing large-scale weather patterns. The main objective of this project is to develop and use a regional scale climate model both to determine the reproducibility of the present Alpine climate and thereby make available a tool for the study of the regional response to various scenarios for global climate change.
