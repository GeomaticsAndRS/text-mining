  GEOHALO: Geoscientific Earth Observation with HALO in the Aegean region  
The new German DHigh Altitude U ¸ (HALO), managed by the German DLR will carry a first geoscience mission in the Aegean region. It will help to better understand the Hellenic subduction zone and the North-Anatolian fault zone and to improve the Aegean gravity field. 
GEOHALO: Geoscientific Earth Observation with HALO in the Aegean region Long Range Research AircraftS The DHigh Altitude U ¸ (HALO) is a new research platform based on a Gulfstream 550 aircraft and managed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). With its unique properties, HALO provides excellent opportunities for the geoscience community to conduct interdisciplinary research projects. HALOSs long range capability is especially important because it allows extensive surveys to be carried out in remote areas. The first HALO geoscience mission covers the Aegean region, a region characterized by high earthquake and tsunami risk that is related to various active plate boundaries. The geoscientific observations will help to better understand the Hellenic subduction zone and the North-Anatolian fault zone and to improve the Aegean gravity field, which provides an important constraint on lithospheric structure and plate kinematics. Flight lines at an elevation of 2.5 km are flown in 2012. HALOSs capability for high-altitude observations will be tested along an additional line flown at the highest possible elevation (15 km), thereby bridging the gap between terrestrial and satellite-based observations of the Earth, especially of its gravity and magnetic field. The research consortium consists of (1) U Bochum, (2) TU Dresden, (3) GFZ Potsdam, (4) BADW München, (5) U Kiel, (6) ETH Zürich, (7) BGR Hannover, (8) AWI Bremerhaven
