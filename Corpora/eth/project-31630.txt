  Enhanced sampling methods for the calculation of relative free energies from molecular dynamics simulations  

Classical atomistic simulations of condensed-phase systems can nowadays be performed over length- and timescales sufficient for the calculation of the relative free energies of different conformational states or of different molecules (computational alchemy). However, in many cases, limited conformational sampling still represents a serious limitation in the accuracy of these calculations. In the present project, two new sampling schemes for the calculation of relative free energies based on molecular dynamics simulations will be developed. These schemes are related to the recently proposed local elevation umbrella sampling (LEUS) approach, in which an optimal biasing potential (leading to quasi-homogeneous sampling in a relevant conformational subspace) is constructed using local penalty functions (build-up phase) and subsequently frozen to generate a biased ensemble of configurations (sampling phase), from which thermodynamic information can be recovered by reweighting. The main goals of the proposed extensions are to enable: (i) the application of the LEUS scheme to evaluate relative free energies of conformational states in high dimensionality problems (molecules with more than a few relevant degrees of freedom); (ii) the application of the LEUS scheme to evaluate relative free energies of molecules instead of conformational states (computational alchemy); (iii) the simultaneous determination of multiple free energy differences from the sampling phase of a single LEUS simulation. Because these new methods are easily automatized, relevant in the investigation of a broad range of (bio)molecular processes, and expected to achieve close-to-optimal sampling efficiency, they should quickly find widespread use in the community.
