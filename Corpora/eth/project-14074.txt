  Effect of spatial factors on the household energy pattern - analysis of the spatial determinants for regional development  

In every country significant geographic variation in household consumption levels are observed. Therefore every country has areas where the incidence of poverty is unusually high. Why are some areas poorer than others? The theory offers two lines of explanation for regional differences in consumption and wellbeing, which in particular differ in their assumptions about migration behaviour and labour mobility. Individualistic explanations assume that people are highly mobile. Poor people tend to remain in poor areas because of specific price incentives, or because they believe that they have a higher chance of making a living in a less competitive environment. In this approach poor areas result from individual behaviour. Structural explanations in contrast, suggest that there exists a causal link between geography and the level of wellbeing. This approach is based on geographical models, where mobility is seen as limited and structural differences between regions in terms of natural resource endowment, infrastructure and access to services, therefore, tend to persist and intensify. We want to test this hypothesis for energy use by combining unit level household data with geographic data. To what extend are the observed spatial disparities in the incidence of energy poverty caused by geographic and infrastructure factors?
