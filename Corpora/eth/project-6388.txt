  Development in the Basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus  

 The dikaryotic mycelium of basidiomycetes can differentiate into the highly organized structure of the fruitbody, where the formation of basidiospores occurs. In contrast to this sexual reproduction, vegetative conidiospores (oidia) are formed mainly on the monokaryotic mycelium. Both developmental processes are regulated by mating types and environmental and internal stimuli. We have chosen to study these processes in C. cinereus and apply classical and molecular genetic techniques to identify genes required for their regulation. We have described oidia formation in detail and have isolated mutants deficient in different steps of this process. Most interestingly, we observed that oidiation is repressed in dikaryons by activation of the A mating type locus, however, this repression is realesed upon light induction. Consequently, we observed that haploid, monokaryotic oidia are produced on a dikaryotic mycelium. The genotypes of the two nuclei in the dikaryon determine which type of nucleus is found in the monokaryotic oidia. Similar to the generation of oidia, the development of a fruitbody on a dicaryotic mycelium is induced by light. We have identified mutants deficient in different steps of fruitbody development. The molecular cloning of the corresponding genes will make it possible to define more closely the regulatory processes of fruitbody development.
