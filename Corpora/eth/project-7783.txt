  Measurement of W Boson Mass and Branching Ratios  

 The W mass is one of the fundamental parameters of the standard model, and its precision measurement is one of the main goals of the LEP2 project. For beam energies close to threshold, a mass measurement can be obtained by measuring the total cross section. The aim is to measure WW production in the different decay channels in order to determine the total cross section as a function of the beam energy, simultaneously with the W decay branching ratios. Exploiting the steep rise of the cross section as a function of the available phase space, which is determined by the beam energy and the W mass, the determination of the total cross section turned out to be the best way to measure the W mass during the first period of data taking, when the beam energy was very close to the production threshold, where the sensitivity to the mass is high. To perform this measurement, all 5 possible decays of W pairs (one fully hadronic, one fully leptonic and three semileptonic) are being studied, and their cross section separately measured. Different analysis techniques are exploited, including multivariate analysis and neural networks for the cases where a satisfactory signal-background separation cannot be obtained with standard techniques. At higher beam energies, a more direct mass measurement can be achieved by reconstructing of the invariant mass of the W decay products. Since detector and selection effects lead to a distortion of the W lineshape, a naive measurement of the reconstructed mass is not sufficient. The experimental challenge is to disentangle distorting effects from the measurement, extracting the underlying physical distribution from the measured one. An unfolding procedure based on the correspondence between generated and reconstructed masses is being set up, and proven to be unbiased, robust and statistically sufficient, at the needed levels of accuracy.
