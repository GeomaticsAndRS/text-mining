  Critical (Information) Infrastructure Protection  
This project tracks the transformation and evolution of critical infrastructures (and closely related issues of homeland security) into a security problem and analyze how practices associated with critical infrastructure protection constitute, and are an expression of, changing notions of security 
Critical infrastructures (CI) are systems or assets so vital to a country that any extended incapacity or destruction of such systems would have a debilitating impact on security, the economy, and national public health or safety, or any combination of the above. The most frequently listed examples encompass the sectors of banking and finance, government services, telecommunication and information and communication technologies, emergency and rescue services, energy and electricity, health services, transportation, logistics and distribution, and water supply. Besides physical assets, their importance is due to the services, the physical and electronic (information) flows they deliver, and their role and function for society. For these reasons, critical infrastructure protection (CIP) is currently seen as an essential part of national security in numerous countries around the world. In this project, we track the transformation and evolution of critical infrastructures (and closely related issues of homeland security) into a security problem and analyze how practices associated with critical infrastructure protection constitute, and are an expression of, changing notions of security and insecurity. This research also explores the rationalities at play as well as the effects of these security practices, and looks at the implications for our understanding of security and politics today.
