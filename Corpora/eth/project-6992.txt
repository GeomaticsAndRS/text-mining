  Search of Alternative Low-pass Filters for Business Survey Data  

As in most business surveys, the KOF/ETH survey in industry asks firms to indicate  on an ordinal scale the changes in comparison to the previous period of several firm specific indicators of their business activities. The questioning demands from the responding person a subjective seasonal correction. But experience shows that after aggregation - time series of these questions include in most cases still an important seasonal pattern. Obviously, firms can only partially distinguish between seasonal and cyclical effects in there business activities. Moreover, time-series of business survey data include an important irregular component. To identify the cyclical tendency we need a low-pass filter which eliminates apart from the seasonal component - the irregular elements. For this purpose the KOF/ETH used up to now the international widely-used Census-X11-procedure. The well-known problems of this filter at the latest values poses problems of interpretation of the actual economic development. The convergence from the first estimation to the final value of an observation takes a considerable time. Additionally, the discrepancy between the first estimation and the final value of the same observation is so large that an actual interpretation of the economic situation is considerably hampered. On the basis of Swiss business survey data we will search for an alternative procedure to the Census-X11-program which provides a quicker stabilisation of the estimated values and shows a higher efficiency at the latest values.
