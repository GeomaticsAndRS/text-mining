  Inactivation of microorganisms on grain products by low-temperature plasma processing  
The inactivation of microorganisms on grains of wheat by means of a lowtemperature plasma treatment is investigated. A plasma circulating fluidized bed reactor operating at low pressure as well as a dielectric barrier discharge operating at ambient pressure are applied for this purpose.
