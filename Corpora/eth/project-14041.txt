  Aggregation of risk measures 
We study in this project the calculation of bounds on risk measures for aggregated risk positions, and this in the presence of incomple marginal risk information.
Given a position on multivariate risks and a risk measure, like Value-at-Risk, say, optimal bounds under partial information on the underlying risk factors is given.
