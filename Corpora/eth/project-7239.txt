  APPOL II - Approximation and Online Algorithms for Optimization Problems  

 In this European thematic network with partners at 14 different sites, we aim to design efficient algorithms with proven worst-case performance guarantees, under strict limitations either on the running-time or on the accessibility of the data. For NP-hard optimization problems, constraints on the running-time can often be satisfied by approximation algorithms; the second limitation leads to the notion of on-line algorithms. The project addresses its objectives by focussing on both traditional paradigmatic problems and algorithmic problems arising in new information technologies.
