  High grade metamorphic ultramafic and mafic rocks of the Southern Steep Belt, Central Alps.  

 The chemistry and mineralogy in high temperature metamorphic rocks of the Zone of BellinzonaDascio are being studied in order to place constraints on their origin and prealpine and metamorphic history. Insights into the evolution of the Alpine Tethys are expected. It is expected that the Tethys in this part of the Alps will betraced and new insights will be gained into its history.
