  Early Solar System chronometry using the extinct 205Pb-205Tl isotope system  

 Lead and thallium are both volatile chalcophile elements. 205Pb decays to 205Tl with a half-life of 15 Myrs, so that Tl isotope compositions will be a function of volatile depletion and core formation. With other independent chronometers available for core formation, the critical goal with Pb-Tl will be determining the timing of volatile element depletion. In particular, we need to know whether the Earth and Moon lost significant fractions of their volatile elements during late accretionary processes or whether they accreted from variable proportions of volatile depleted material.
