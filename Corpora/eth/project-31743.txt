  OXIGEN  
Oxide Dispersion Strengthened Materials for the Additive Manufacture of High Temperature Components in Power Generation
The OXIGEN project, funded under the European CommissionsS 7th Framework Programme, will aim to develop Oxide Dispersion Strengthened (ODS) alloys that are individually designed to address specific high temperature materials performance challenges currently limiting power generation component capabilities. This will lead to the prospect of higher efficiency power generation turbine systems. OXIGEN will combine leading-edge European expertise in the manufacture of specialist powder alloys (Mechanical Alloying), knowledge of niche high-temperature materials and develop capabilities for demonstrator manufacture using laser based additive manufacturing technologies. This will produce an integrated, world-leading capability to directly manufacture from powder to part, custom-designed and best-in-class high temperature alloys for power generation component applications.
