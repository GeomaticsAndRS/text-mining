  Predictive physical models and large-scale computer simulations to study the role of electrostatics and couplings in the nonequilibrium dynamics of biological membranes in relation to lipid rafts and endocytosis  
We will develop a multi-phenomenon hybrid particle-continuum computer model to bridge the gap between the scales of individual (electrically or mechanically active) proteins, lipid rafts, and vesicle budding and fission. Such a model allows predictive simulations of protein-containing lipid membanes
