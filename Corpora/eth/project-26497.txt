  SysteMTb (Systems Biology of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis)  
The grand goal of the SysteMTb project is to establish a Systems Biology framework to understand key features of MTb and its interactions with the host which, in turn,  will provide new insights and a solid knowledge for the development of novel and cost-effective strategies to combat tuberculosis.
