  Optimization of Emulsion Polymerization Processes Based on Coagulation Behavior of the Obtained Latexes  
Understand the correlations between particle surface properties and particle stability in intense flow, in order to develop polymerization processes that warrantee not only good stability during polymerization but also easy coagulation after polymerization under shear without using any electrolytes.
In most cases, during the coagulation of polymer latexes, it is required adding electrolytes in order to destabilize the systems, but after the coagulation the added electrolytes cannot be completely eliminated from the polymers and lead to changes in electronic and mechanical properties of the final products, as well as their color. The goal of this project is to develop emulsion polymerization processes through optimization of the surfactant systems, which not only warrantee good stability during the polymerization but also result in polymer latexes that can be coagulated under high turbulent shear without using any electrolytes. To this aim, we will investigate the fundamentals about the correlations between the particle surface properties (surfactant type, fixed charges, adsorbed surfactant state, etc.) and the turbulent coagulation behavior, in order to define an optimal strategy for the emulsion polymerization processes. The employed measurement techniques are dynamic and static light scattering, surfactant adsorption isotherm, zeta-potential, and microscopy combined with image analysis.
