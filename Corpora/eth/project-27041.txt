  Multiferroic order induced by strain  
Magnetically ordered epitaxial films of EuO, CaMnO3 and SrMnO3 are investigated for the emergence of strain-induced ferroelectricity.
We study epitaxial strain effects in thin film systems, in particular we aim for strain-induced ferroelectricity in magnetically ordered oxides to achieve novel forms of multiferroicity. At this, our theoretical and experimental work focuses on the ferromagnetic semicondutor EuO and on the antiferromagnetic perovskites CaMnO3 and SrMnO3. Theory predicts these materials to become ferroelectric above feasible critical strains [1,2] and for SrMnO3, ferroelectricity has even been achieved by shifting interatomic distances due to chemical doping [3]. Optical second harmonic generation, piezoresponse force microscopy and resistivity measurements are employed to detect the ferroelectric state, while x-ray and electron diffraction as well as scanning tunneling microscopy enable the strutural characterization of the films. While there is clear evidence of a ferroelectricity in strained EuO so far, at least a polar state has be identified in SrMnO3 thin films, whose microscopic origin needs further investigations. CaMnO3 displays incipient ferroelectricity. 1. E. Bousquet et al., PRL 104, 037601 (2010) 2. J. H. Lee et al., PRL 104, 207204 (2010) 3. H. Sakai et al., PRL 107, 137601 (2011)
