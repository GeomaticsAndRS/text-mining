  Applied Vision Research - The Role of Head Movements in Perceiving Depth  

 At many work places depth perception is needed to complete tasks. Handling materials as well as more complex tasks, for example manipulation by means of a robot system, require the ability of depth perception. Our visual system enables us to perceive depth using different mechanisms. Stereoscopic vision, the most well known mechanism, compares the images perceived by the two eyes in order to determine the depth of seen objects. Visual experience uses memorised sizes of known objects and compares it to the actual perceived size of seen objects to retrieve observation distance. So called motion parallax is probably the least known cue for visual depth perception. It consists of analysing relative movements between the objects projected on the retina. If these movements are due to the observers head movement, relative velocities and direction of relative movements are characterised for the separation in depth of the objects. Motion parallax can, for example, be experienced while travelling in a car and fixating on an object outside the car. Objects which are at a different distance to the observer than the fixated object will move in a certain direction and with a given velocity relative to the fixated object. We are investigating the contribution of motion parallax to depth perception. For this purpose manipulation tasks were carried out on a stereoscopic display at which the effect of motion parallax as well as the effect of other depth cues could be simulated. Our findings demonstrate that motion parallax is one of the most important cues for depth perception. We will apply our findings to real work places, for example, telemanipulation, molecule and machinery construction, as well as to virtual reality tools.
