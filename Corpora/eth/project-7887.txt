  Delay Locked Loop (DLL)  

In all serial communication systems the transmitted data has to be synchronized with the  local clock and word aligned at the receiver side. A new architecture, based on the Delay Locked Loop (DLL), has been developed allowing a phase alignment of the incoming data packet. An output clock is generated giving a pulse at every input packet (10 bits) and the data is internally deserialized forming a complete clock extraction and serial-to-parallel converter. Thus the DLL does not only performs clock synchronisation, but also word alignment. The DLL circuit developed does not require any complex data coding: every uncoded 8 bits data has to bee surrounded by a start and a stop bit. Due to the internal architecture of the DLL circuit, the lock-in time, or synchronisation time, is reduced comparing with the classical PLL circuit. Actually, even before reaching the complete synchronisation, data are already available at the output. Power requirement is 1W @ V$_{ee}$=-4.5V and the power supply operation is within the -4V to -5V range over a temperature span of 0\dgC to 80\dgC. The circuit has been realized on a 1\gmm bipolar SGS-Thomson technology.
