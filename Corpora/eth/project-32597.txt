  Anthropogenic carbon and heat uptake by the Southern Ocean  
On average, the Southern Ocean absorbs 75% of anthropogenic heat and 42% of anthropogenic carbon in a new set of climate model simulations. This region thus plays a central role in determining the rate of climate change. However, the exact processes governing the uptake are currently unknown.
