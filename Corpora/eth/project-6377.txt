  Production of specific biocatalysts and chiral intermediates.  

 The topic of the research proposed is the development of stable biocatalysts based on isolated oxygenases, supported by enzymatic coenzyme regeneration. Recent studies on such biocatalytic enzyme systems have proven the principle feasibility and shown constant high volumetric productivity over several hours in organic/aqueous reaction media on laboratory scale. In this project stabilization will be achieved by immobilization of oxygenases together with the NADH regenerating enzyme. These immobilisates will be tested in two liquid phase biotransformation processes with respect to their perspectives as biocatalysts for organic synthesis. This project will show the chances to increase stability and productivity of oxygenases and cofactor regeneration systems in organic solvents by immobilization and will also identify immobilization techniques suitable in this respect. In addition, the design of two liquid phase processes based on these biocatalysts will reveal the economical feasibility of this approach with respect to catalyst preparation and the process itself. 2-Hydroxybiphenyl 3-monooxygenase (HbpA) and styrene monooxygenase (StyAB) will be used as model enzymes for the preparation of 3-substituted catechols and chiral phenyl oxiranes substituted in ortho-or para-position with methyl, chloro, bromo or nitro functions. In addition, we use recombinant multicomponent chlorobenzene dioxygenase (CDO) from Pseudomonas sp. P51 in E. coli for stereoselective preparation of naphthalene,- toluene-, and indandiols.
