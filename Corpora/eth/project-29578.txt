  PSC-bridging plant sciences and policy: Development and validation of a novel barcoding strategy to support identification, tracing and trade regulation of precious timber trees in one of the world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots 
The goal of this project is to develop a DNA barcoding system for endangered rosewood species from Madagascar to facilitate their conservation and trade control. 
Rapid recent increase of illegal logging of timber trees in Madagascar represents a major threat to rosewood species (genus Dalbergia) and endangers tropical rainforests that are among the worldSs most diverse ecosystems. Loggin activities are market-driven and and extend far into protected areas, such as national parks and UNESCO world heritage sites, including the SRainforests ¸ of the one of the three most important biodiversity hotspots in the world. A recent study AtsinananaT, published in Science (Barrett et al. 2010) established that eight Dalbergia species that are known ´ under the term SrosewoodS are under immediate risk for extinction as a consequence of logging and has called for protection via international trade regulation under CITES. Distinguishing and identifying the involved species is essential for trade regulation but is often difficult, especially in the context of logged trees that lack most characteristics used for species identification. As a consequence, we here propose a project in collaboration with policy-implementing partners in which a jointly supervised PhD student first develops and validates a DNA barcoding system for rosewood of the genus Dalbergia from Madagascar that can be used in the context of CITES regulation. In a second step, the PhD student will do an internship in our policy-implementing partner organizations in Madagascar and Switzerland with the goal to develop a simple and implementable chain of custody permitting CITES to be applied effectively for rosewood species in Madagascar.
