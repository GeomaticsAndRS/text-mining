  High frequency atomic force microscopy 
This project primarily aims at extending and improving AFM bandwidth and resolution in ambient conditions. Ultimately it would be desirable to obtain resolutions in ambient that rival low temperature vacuum based environments and the more recent tuning fork setups.
