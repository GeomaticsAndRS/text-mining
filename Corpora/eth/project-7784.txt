  Measurement of Triple Gauge Vector Boson Coupling  

 The s-channel pair production of real W bosons allows a precise determination of the coupling among the electroweak bosons, probing the gauge structure of the Standard Model. The importance of this measurement at LEP is enhanced by the fact that in hadron machines the sensitivity to gauge boson couplings is quite small, so the smaller luminosity collected at LEP is already sufficient to draw interesting conclusions, like excluding the non-existence of the ZWW coupling. The trilinear gauge coupling (TGC) influences the WW total cross section, as well as the distribution of the W production and decay angles. As for the mass, close to threshold most of the TGC information is in the cross section dependence, so a measurement of the cross section can be interpreted in terms of coupling limits, fixing the mass to a value determined independently. At higher energy, W production and decay asymmetries become more and more pronounced, and can be exploited for coupling purposes. As for the mass, the measured values of these quantities suffer from effects of measurement uncertainties, and a similar fitting procedure to account for this effect has been set up. The measurements of the W mass and its couplings will become more and more interesting with the increased luminosity and energy expected in the forthcoming years.
