  Modeling of catalysis in porous media for automotive applications  
Experimental studies have shown that ceramic foam based catalysts can be  more efficient than conventional honeycomb catalysts typically used for automotive applications. The goal of this project is to model heat and mass transfer phenomena including heterogeneous chemical reactions in ceramic foams.
Ceramic foams, as developed by the EMPA I.C. Engines laboratory, have excellent properties as catalyst substrates for automotive applications. Extensive studies have shown that ceramic foam based catalysts can achieve similar pollutant conversion efficiencies but with roughly a third of the precious metal amount and a half of the external dimensions in respect to state-of-the-art conventional honeycomb catalysts. Additional development is required for benefitting from these advantages over the entire engine operating regime as well as investigating and utilizing their full potential. The small-scale phenomena governing the chemical, mass transport and fluid mechanical processes in the foam have yet to be examined and better understood. The scale of the problem however renders an experimental evaluation extremely difficult and impractical, if not impossible. The computational approach allows for an analytical investigation on various scales and provides a multitude of data unrivaled by experimental methods. Computational methods are in this case essential for understanding the fundamental processes at work. The existing CFD code TransAT will be extended with a heterogeneous reaction module. TransAT is finite volume based code that uses immersed boundaries to tackle complex geometries. In the first approximation, the reactions on the catalyst surface (immersed boundary) are assumed to be mass transfer limited. In a refined model, finite rate chemistry and wash coat diffusion will be considered.
