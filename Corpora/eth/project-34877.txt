  Enhancing the activity of CeO2 for low-temperature alkyne hydrogenation  
This project investigates strategies that may enhance the reactivity of CeO2 in hydrogenation catalysis, enabling the understanding of structure-performance relationships and  low-temperature operation.
The recent discovery that pure CeO2 catalyzes the semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to the corresponding olefins has broadened the scope of ceria in catalysis. However, high temperatures are generally required, because of the hampered hydrogen splitting ability of the catalyst. This work revisits recent developments in the field of ceria-catalyzed alkyne hydrogenation and highlights the strategies that can enhance the reactivity of CeO2 in hydrogenation. Particularly, we have compared the shape-dependent activity of ceria nanocatalysts with cubic and conventional morphologies in C2H2 hydrogenation and CO oxidation. The material exposing (111) facets shows a higher hydrogenation activity while the (100) surfaces dominate in oxidation. The calcination at high temperature induces a strong alteration of the catalyst morphology, increasing the amount of (100) facets in conventional samples and (110) facets in nanocubes, and improving the oxygen storage capacity of the samples. Consequently, these catalysts appear to be more active in oxidation rather than in hydrogenation. This can be related to the easier formation of ceria oxygen vacancies and defect sites on CeO2 (100), which are adverse in C2H2 hydrogenation and active ingredients for CO oxidation, and suggests the criteria for an optimal design of ceria nanocatalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, we have investigated the performance of gallium and indium-doped CeO2 catalysts for low-temperature acetylene hydrogenation, which may pave the way for a more efficient use of this material.
