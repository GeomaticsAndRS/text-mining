  Human Equality and Intra- as well as Intercultural Diversity  

In opposition to a widespread view according to which it is possible to make general statements  about specific cultures and societies, but not about the human being as such, the following hypothesis will be advanced and substantiated: It is easier to make general statements (species-specific) about the human being: statements that apply to all human beings, only to human beings and not to other living beings as well, than to make general statements (population-specific) about one culture (or one society, one "race", one nation, one epoch, one sex) that apply to all members of that one culture (society, "race", nation, epoch, sex), only to them and not to members of other cultures (other societies, other "races", other nations, other epochs, the other sex).
