  Luminescence Phenomena in Organic Nonlinear Optical Single Crystals 

 The strong interest in organic crystals for nonlinear optical applications (frequency conversion, electro-optics and photorefractive effects) originates from the possibilities of an almost taylor-like building of the organic molecules and the crystal packing. The optical properties of these materials is mostly defined by their chemical structure and the resulting energy configurations of the electronic states of the molecules with respect to their surrounding (solution or crystal packing). We perform luminescence spectroscopic measurements on solutions and organic single crystals in order to directly determine the electronic transition processes leading to the intra-or inter-molecular charge transfer responsible for the linear and nonlinear optical properties of these materials. The luminescence characterization is concentrated upon our newly synthesized organic nonlinear optical molecules; crystals of some co-crystal derivatives based on merocyanine dye and some stilbazolium salts 4-N,N­dimethylamino-4'-N'- methyl stilbazolium tosylate (DAST) show strong one and two photon photoluminescence. Doing these investigations of the luminescence properties (polarization, yield, lifetime and temperature dependence) we expect to be able to develop new organic crystals with improved properties more efficiently.
