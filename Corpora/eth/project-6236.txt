  Circular Test Track IVT: Test No. 6, Thin Surface and Base Courses on RecycledCement Bound Subbase Courses  

 With the sixth full-scale accelerated test on the IVT test-facility in Dübendorf four different pavement structures will be tested at the same time and under the same load and environment conditions. The sections are constructed as follows: 1. 35 mm mastic asphalt 0/11, 70 mm hot mix base course 0/22, stress absorbing membran interlayer, 250 mm cement bound subbase (50% recycled bituminous bound road material, 50% gravel) 2. Same as above, but different binders for the mastic asphalt and the hot mix layer 3. 25 mm mastic asphalt 0/18, 50 mm hot mix base course 0/16, stress absorbing membran interlayer, 250 mm cement bound subbase (50% recycled bituminous bound road material, 50 % gravel) 4. Same as above, but different binders for the mastic asphalt and the hot mix layer. Extensive measurements and supporting laboratory tests should lead to guiding principles for pavement structures as described.
