  KTI: Intelligent Photo Managment for the Smartphone Age  

We propose a CTI project between the partners ETH Zurich and kooaba AG. kooaba is a spin-off from the Computer Vision Lab at ETH Zurich, and its core competency is image recognition. Since its foundation in 2006 kooaba has developed an image recognition platform, which belongs to the leading offerings of its kind worldwide. On top of that recognition platform consumer applications are built. While kooaba focuses on very few selected consumer applications, the platform is also licensed to third parties, who develop additional consumer applications. The goal of this research project is to expand the breadth of application for kooabaSs recognition platform in terms of image content that can be recognized, as well as application domains. In particular, the project aims at revolutionizing the way people deal with digital pictures in the Smartphone and Internet age. With this, a whole new market segment will open for kooaba.
