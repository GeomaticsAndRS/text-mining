  Variable Length Markov Chains  

Variable length Markov chains (VLMC) build a very flexible class of tree structured models for stationary categorical time series such as DNA or binary sequence data. VLMC modelling represents a strategy to deal intelligently with the curse of dimensionality: unlike classical full Markov chain models, the memory of a VLMC has varying length depending on how the immediate past (lagged values) of the process actually looks like. The project addresses wide ranging problems, from theory to development of software: (i) tuning the context algorithm for fitting VLMC's; (ii) approximation properties of estimated VLMC's for general stationary processes; (iii) developing efficient implementations and diagnostic tools for VLMC modelling; (iv) applying VLMC's for DNA classification.
