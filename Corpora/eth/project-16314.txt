  Exploring the microbial diversity in deeply buried marine sediments. Investigations of Ocean Drilling Program Leg 201 samples 
We propose to characterize the microbial communities in samples recently obtained during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 201 on the Peru margin (South Pacific) in order to understand their function in the deep sub-seafloor environment.
