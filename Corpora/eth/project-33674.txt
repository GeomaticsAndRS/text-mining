  MacroPark - Macroscopic approach to evaluate the short-term effects of parking on urban traffic congestion 

The parking system can affect the traffic system through two processes: parking search, which can cause higher traffic density; and on-street parking maneuvers, which can directly cause additional delay. Both can lead to more congested traffic conditions, and lower travel speeds on the network. On the other side, the traffic system can also affect the parking system. Average travel speeds highly influence the arrival rate to the parking facilities, and ultimately, the level of parking usage. Here, we propose a model to evaluate these impacts at a macroscopic level. Main tools used to support the study include probability theory, macroscopic fundamental diagram, kinematic wave theory, dimensional analysis, and queuing theory. With the proposed macroscopic model, for any given time interval, the transitions of vehicles between different parking related families (i.e., non-searching, searching, and parking) can be shown. Similarly, both the parking and traffic indicators can be updated (e.g., traffic density, average travel speed, average delay, parking occupancy, parking supply, and share of parking searchers within traffic). The macroscopic model proposed in this study has low data requirements, but it should still provide reasonable aggregate results to make informed decisions about network management and control, as well as to assess the impact of different parking related strategies. With this approach, a better optimization scheme for the system can be developed in terms of both traffic performance and parking usage.
