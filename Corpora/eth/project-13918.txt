  Hydrogeophysics 
We will investigate the capabilities of clustering algorithms, combine information from crosshole and surface geophysical data in a quantitative fashion and begin developing methods to integrate very high-resolution logging data and 3 D geophysical data for constraining 2 D/3-D aquifer models.
