  Carbon Nanotube-based Ultra-miniature Pressure Sensors 
This project aims for the development of an ultra-miniature pressure sensor based on a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor. The minute size of single-walled carbon  nanotubes offers the possibility of sensor devices that may surpass state-of-the-art devices in both size and power consumption.
The goal of this project is the development, fabrication and characterization of a novel singlewalled carbon nanotube (SWNT)-based pressure sensor. The device employs a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNFET) as sensing element, where the mechanical deformation of a mem in response to the ambient pressure U is translated into a change in the electrical output brane U signal. The small size of the SWNTs allows to reduce the membrane dimensions to the order of microns. For the creation of these micro-membranes, a new fabrication process needs to be developed, which results in membranes with the desired properties. The electromechanical sensing concept will be evaluated and the produced devices will be characterized in terms of sensitivity, pressure range and repeatability.
