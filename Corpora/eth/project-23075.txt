  Selective magnetic filtration of metals from dilute, acidic streams using carbon-coated nanomagnets  
Magnetic filtration provides an efficient way to control large liquid volumes with a small amount of a specific reagent. We are applying our carbon-coated nanomagnet for  the extraction of metal from dilute, acidic streams.
