  Is a good Deacon catalyst a good oxychlorination catalyst?  
The performance of the new generation of HCl oxidation catalysts for  ethylene oxychlorination is evaluated in this project. It will allow to gather a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences in the chemistry between these two processes. Its aim is enabling a rational design of the
