Alkylation of benzene with n-hexane was performed over H-ZSM-5 and monometallic Ga- and Pt The influence of the particle size and the method of and bimetallic Ga- and Pt-modified ZSM-5. a incorporation of Ga (during hydrothermal synthesis, by solid-state ion exchange, or by liq.-state The presence of Pt and well-dispersed extra framework Ga in H-ZSM-5 ion exchange) was detd. a Well-dispersed Pt parincreased the selectivity in alkylation and suppressed cracking reactions. a The method of Ga incorporation played an important ticles led to better catalytic performance. a role in obtaining higher selectivity to alkylation products and in the suppression of side reactions. Up to 93% selectivity in alkylation (of which >95% was to 2-phenylhexane) was reached over 2 a We propose that the close prowt% Pt/H-GafZSM5, in which Ga occupied framework positions. a ximity of very small Pt nanoparticles and Ga-(OH)-Si acid sites results in the optimal bifunctional During the reaction, catalyst for selective prodn. of 2-phenylhexane from benzene and n-hexane. a the catalyst deactivated, most probably due to the sintering of the Pt particles.
