  Biosynthesis and mode of action of the bacterial signaling factor and antibiotic hormaomycin  
Hormaomycin is a structurally unusual peptide antibiotic that induces morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism in streptomycete bacteria. Aim of this project is to characterize the enzymes involved in hormaomycin biosynthesis and to determine the mode of action.
