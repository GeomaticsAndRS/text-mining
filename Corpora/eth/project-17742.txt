  Geodynamics of the Eastern Mediterranean (GEODEM) 
GPS-Measurements are being evaluated to closer determine the kinematic field in the Eastern Mediterranean. Emphasis is also placed to improve and develop models describing the strain rate field in this region and to interpret the results in terms of geodynamic processes. 
The Eastern Mediterranean is one of the seismotectonically most active regions in Europe. The aim of this project is to derive a detailed kinematic and strain rate field for this region as a contribution to a better understanding of the ongoing deformation processes. 15 year records of continuous GPS (CGPS) time series of crustal motion will be compiled and analyzed to derive long-term rates of crustal motion, eventually extract co-seismic slip and shed light on pre-seismic motion and postseismic relaxation of the earth's crust. Special attention will be given to error modeling and signal extraction of GPS time series. The overall objective is to robustly constrain the present-day crustal movements and geodetic strain rate field in the Eastern Mediterranean area, analyze its variation in space and time and derive 3D kinematic models. Methods and algorithms for time-dependent strain rate field retrieval are intended to be developed and improved. Finally the results are to be interpreted in terms of geodynamic processes. The operated CGPS-network in Greece is shown in Figure 1, including recently installed sites in the southeast Aegean Sea and along the North Aegean trough. The second Figure presents the arc-parallel extension along the Hellenic Trench system. The fault-parallel velocity components along the North Aegean trough and fault plane solutions of earthquakes (Mw>6) are shown in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows an extract of a developed Finite Element model of the North Aegean sea and corresponding velocity residuals at GPS sites.
