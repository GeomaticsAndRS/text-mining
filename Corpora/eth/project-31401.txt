  Rooting for a sustainable future: Can Crops with Greater Rooting Systems Improve Nitrogen Retention and Mitigate Emissions of Nitrous Oxide? 
We plan to study the effect of rooting depth on N2O production and reduc-  tion within throughout the soil profile. Four genotypes of wheat, known to differ in root growth, will be cultivated in tall columns in the greenhouse. Isotope values and concentrations of NH4+, NO3- and N2O will be assessed.
