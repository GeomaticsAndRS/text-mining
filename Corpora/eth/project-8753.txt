  Transport and correlations in mesoscopic superconducting and normal-metallic structures  
We study transport, noise, and the Full Counting Statistics in mesoscopic (superconducting) devices. Special emphasis is on novel quantum phenomena such as the behavior of single-electron pulses, effects of interaction, and entanglement.
