  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations as a tool in EPR spectroscopy of transition metal compounds  

The success of DFT as a tool for the theoretical prediction of EPR properties originates from two facts: The implicit consideration of electron correlation and the favourite scaling of the computing time concerning the size of the treated system which is very important for transition metal containing compounds like metalloproteins, enzyme-model compounds and catalysts. Results obtained from DFT calculations can be very helpful in interpreting experimental data (for instance the relative orientation of the g and hyperfine tensors) and deepening the understanding of the electronic and geometric structure. However, one has to bear in mind, that these results have still to be evaluated carefully and a lot of benchmarking has to be done before such applications will become routine - especially for transition metal containing complexes, since there relativistic approaches have to be implemented and tested and also appropriate basis sets have to be developed.
