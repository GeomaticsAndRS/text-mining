  NCCR Digital Fabrication - Robot localization for on-site construction  
Development of an ultra-wideband localization system to augment existing sensors and help facilitate robust localization and navigation in cluttered environments such as construction sites. 
The difficulty in accurately localizing robots within complex environments limits their real-world usage. Current solutions require significant processing and static environments (computer vision); are reliant on expensive equipment and are restricted in size (motion capture); or are not suitable for operation in enclosed environments (GPS). The "Robot Localization for On-Site Construction" component of the NCCR Digital Fabrication proposes the development of an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio localization system that addresses the shortcomings of existing systems by integrating new technology with algorithmic innovation and environmental modelling.
