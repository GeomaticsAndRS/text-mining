  Modelling of Transport Processes in Porous Materials by Percolation Theory  

 Flow, dispersion and displacement processes in porous media arise in many diverse fields of science and engineering. In construction these processes play a key factor in respect to the durability of these materials. Judging the potential of corrosion on construction materials requires the knowledge of the underlying transport phenomena, which make reacting agents available. The classical theory describes the kinetics of water absorption of porous media (e.g. concrete, mortar or cement paste) with a capillary or potential theory. Both theories result in the well known square-root equation, e.g. water uptake is proportional to the square root of time. Laboratory experiments in different test laboratories world-wide and in our lab showed that this square root equation does not fit the experimental data. The major reason is that these theories don't consider the complex porestructure of the medium. Research work at IBWK has shown that the porestructure of the cement paste can be described with a discrete model as a random network of bonds and sites. The percolation theory describes the connectivity, conductivity and diffusivity effects in these models. Statistical and network methods of two-phase flow and displacement in porous media are developed to compute and predict the capillary transport of water.
