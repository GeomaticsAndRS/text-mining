  Conductance Quantization and Transport in Thermal Equilibrium (via Gapless Modes) 

 The electrical conductance of an adiabatic, ballistic quantum wire is quantized in even multiples of e$^{2}$/h, as first discovered by van Wees et al., almost ten years ago. More recent experiments have indicated that this quantization is independent of the strength of electron-electron interactions and of temperature T (as long as T is close to 0 K). Similar "quantization phenomena" are observed for heat currents in one-dimensional thermal conductors, for electromagnetic flux, etc. We have studied the relationship between these phenomena and the quantization of the Hall conductivity. Furthermore, we have found that these phenomena are examples of "transport in thermal equilibrium". We have established sum rules for currents and a new variant of the Goldstone theorem explaining the universality of the observed phenomena in agreement with experimental data. Our theory suggests that boundary conformal field theory (in the sense of John Cardy) can be applied to make more detailed quantitative predictions. This leads to analogies between our theory and the theory of D-branes in string theory. We plan to investigate boundary conformal field theory more systematically and work out new applications of our "theory of transport in thermal equilibrium" to superfluid helium and to astrophysical phenomena.
