  Modular Performance Analysis of Distributed Embedded Real-Time Systems  
In this project we investigate several extensions of our previous results in the field of formal system level performance analysis. The main goal is to improve the completeness, the accuracy and the embedding into the industrial design flow of the developed framework for modular performance analysis
One of the major challenges in the design process of real-time embedded systems is to accurately predict performance characteristics of the final system implementation in early design stages. On one hand reliable predictions on end-to-end delays, memory demands and resource usages are essential to guarantee that the designed system meets all given performance requirements before any time and resources are invested for the actual implementation of the system. On the other hand an accurate and efficient performance analysis is necessary to drive the design space exploration and thus support important design decisions. In this project we investigate several extensions and possible improvements of our previous results in the field of formal system level performance analysis and in particular of the developed framework for modular performance analysis (MPA). The main goal is to enhance the completeness, the accuracy and the embedding into the industrial design flow of our performance analysis method. More in detail we intend to: - Analyze new system component models in order to widen the area of application of our performance analysis method to highly heterogeneous distributed embedded systems - Investigate models and methods that permit to take into account complex timing correlations into the performance analysis - Develop and investigate methods to analyze system designs with cyclic dependencies - Understand the role of performance analysis in order to analyze system robustness and to design robust systems - Connect the MPA framework to simulation-based performance estimation mehtods - Develop software tools to apply the new models and methods in realistic scenarios
