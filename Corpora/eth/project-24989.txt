  Slow muons and muonium  
New methods for the production of slow muon and muonium beams are investigated. This could provide phase space densities of these particles and atoms improved by orders of magnitude. We ultimately aim at fundamental experiments such as precision spectroscopy and gravitational interaction of muonium.
