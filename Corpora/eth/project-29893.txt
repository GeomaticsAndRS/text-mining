The proposed research work aims to improve overall plant performance using optimization tools for waste management planning and scheduling. Given that the set of waste storage and treatment options is complex and daily operation often faces a changing and uncertain environment, the decision making process of waste and utility management stands for a crucial task in order to tackle higher energy prices, uncertainty, dwindling margins and stricter operational constraints. The focus consists of developing: (i) process models on the basis of the available information in each decision stage; (ii) indicators to capture the process "footprint" in all the aforementioned aspects; (iii) optimization algorithms to adapt the control parameters or decision variables of the process models towards the desired optimum; (iv) decision support tools (e.g., sensitivity/Uucertainty analysis, pareto methods) which assess the robustness of the achieved solution in a multi-objective way.
