  Maximizing the integration capacity of the European Union: Lessons and prospects for enlargement and beyond (MAXCAP)  
The research project starts with a critical analysis of the effects of the 2004- 2007 enlargement on stability, democracy and prosperity of candidate countries, on the one hand, and the EUSs institutions, on the other. We then investigate how the EU can maximize its integration capacity.
MAXCAP aims to: a) explain the effects of the EUSs integration modes and strategies on democracy and socioeconomic development in the new members, candidates and neighbourhood countries; b) establish conditions for effective decision-making and implementation in an enlarged EU; c) identify the social limits to the EUSs integration capacity related to citizensS perceptions of the last and future enlargements; d) study the EUSs current and past negotiation strategies in the context of enlargement; e) examine how the EU employs different modes of integrating countries with highly diverse economic powers, democratic qualities of governance, and institutional capacities; f) assess whether alternative models, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy, can be successful in bringing countries closer to the EU.
