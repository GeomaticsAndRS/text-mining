  The Firefly Chamber  

 A new technique to collect the light emitted through the electron avalanche process in a thin gap wire chamber is under study. The light is captured by wavelength shifting fibers and recorded by a photosensitive device outside of the chamber. The light collecting fibers are arranged in such a way as to form cells delivering x - y coordinates. The main advantages of this technique is the possibility of tuning the light yield for shower detection in sampling calorimeters, to produce fast and noise free signals, to have only passive elements at the front end and good signal transportation via the optical fibers. The cathodes are sintered brass pieces acting as absorber material, in order to minimize the overall dimensions of the calorimeter.
