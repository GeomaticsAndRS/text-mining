  Engineered Protein Capsids as Artificial Bacterial Organelles  
We are applying our experience with protein design and laboratory evolution to extend the properties of proteins that self-assemble into regular, shell-like, polyhedral structures to create practical, non-viral encapsulation systems for applications in the test tube and in living cells.
