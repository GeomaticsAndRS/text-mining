  Synthesis of block-copolymer surfactants  
Short, ampliplilic block-copolymers are attractive not only synthetically but also as surfactants, which could possibly be advantageous over conventional surfactants or as drug delivery media. Their synthesis is realized via living polymerization and their applicability is subsequently evaluated.
In this synthetic work amphiphilic block-copolymers are synthesized via RAFT polymerization. Characterization of the resulting copolymers is done by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and 1H-NMR. After confirming their solubility in water, their Critical Micellization Concentrations (CMC) are determined by surface tension measurements. Experiments utilizing these novel surfactants are performed to prove their stabilization effect and biodegradability. Moreover, in order to test their toxicity, the surfactants may be cultivated together with cells. According to the results of the above mentioned studies, their applicability as bio-vesiclesS stabilizers is assessed.
