  Design and study of new catalytic systems for efficient water splitting  
The project aim is to develop specially designed structure-controlled molecular ruthenium catalysts, using bisbenzimidazole as rigid ligand matrix. Appropriately adjusting the ligands sphere of ruthenium allows creating catalysts with enhanced activity toward water oxidation.
