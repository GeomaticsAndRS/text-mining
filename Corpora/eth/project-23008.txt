  Elucidation of MicroRNAs as Regulators of Metabolism and Targets for Therapeutic Intervention  
The studies will identify microRNAs whose expression is altered in pancreatic islets, liver, muscle and adipose tissue of diabetic mouse models and humans. Dysregulated microRNAs will be studied for their role in lipid and glucose metabolism using modern cell biological and genetic approaches.
