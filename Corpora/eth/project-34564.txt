  SAVUCA: Southern African Value Added Cassava: Next-generation cassava with enhanced agronomic and industrial performances for southern Africa  
We propose in this research to expand existing RNA-mediated technologies to explore novel and combinatorial approaches, such as multiple trait transgenes; peptide aptamers and stacked hairpin constructs; and tasiRNAs to induce resistance to cassava-infecting geminiviruses (CGMs) and ipomoviruses.
