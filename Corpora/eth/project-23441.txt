  Extension of the Development and implementation of methods to homogenize daily and sub-daily surface climate data  
Homogenisation of surface climate data is essential for the accurate monitoring of climate variability and climate change. In this project we develop new, physics-based methods to better homogenize long, subdaily, meteorological series from several Swiss stations  back to the 18th century.
