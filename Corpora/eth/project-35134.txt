  Tracing atmospheric deposition of selenium and other trace elements in ombrotrophic peat bogs  
This project is aimed at investigating atmospheric cycling of the trace element selenium (Se), using ombrotrophic peat bogs and present-day wet and dry deposition samples from the Pyrenees. These studies will give insight in the sources and quantities of atmospheric Se inputs in terrestrial systems.
