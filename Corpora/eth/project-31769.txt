  Methodology to Determine Effectiveness of Filtration Media against Nanoparticles in the Size Range of 3 to 500 Nanometer  
The project is to develop a European standard and technical specification for filtration of airborne nanoparticles down to single-digit nanometer range, sponsored by the European Committee for Standardisation in the frame of the mandate M/461 ”Standardisation activities regarding nanotechnologies”.
