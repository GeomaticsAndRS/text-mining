  Applications, function, and structure of the novel 2-hydroxybiphenyl monooxygenase from Pseudomonasazelaica HBP1. 

 The NADH dependent flavin containing 2-hydroxybiphenyl monooxygenase (HbpA) from Pseudomonas azelaica HBP1 catalyzes the regioselective hydroxylation of ortho substituted phenols to yield 3-substituted catechol derivatives. The project aims at engineering of HbpA to create new catalytic functions and a basic understanding of the reaction mechanism of this enzyme. Structural information together with the information of the complete sequence of the monooxygenase gene will allow us to start rational 'protein engineering' experiments. In paralell, mutants of HbpA will be generated by random mutagenesis and suitable selection / screening procedures (directed evolution) and characterized with respect to altered catalytic and structural features. The goal of the work is to obtain new and efficient catalysts for the preparation of different catechols and derivatives thereof, which are difficult or impossible to obtain chemically. We also strive to better understand the the reaction mechanism and especially the formation of hydrogen peroxide by oxygenases transforming non-physiological substrates.
