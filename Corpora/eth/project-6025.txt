  Electrochemical Techniques for Monitoring the Conditions of Concrete Bridge Structures  

 Chloride induced corrosion of rebars is the main cause of damage of reinforced concrete bridge structures. Chlorides from deicing salts enter into porous concrete structure and finally cause localized corrosion attacks on the originally well protected passive reinforcing steel. These corrosion attacks are primarily influenced by environmental factors such as chloride concentration, pH or oxygen content of the adjacent electrolyte in the pores. Therefore the environmental exposition of the concrete structures, favoring conditions for stable and rapid corrosion propagation, is of decisive importance for the durability and the service life of reinforced concrete structures. Monitoring these changing conditions in the concrete cover of real structures over an extended period of time will certainly give a much better insight into the actual processes occuring during the corrosion of reinforced concrete. The term monitoring is used for continuously working monitoring systems, where sensor devices (chloride and resistivity sensors, corroding rebar probes) are built into the structure, allowing permanent recording of certain parameters. The effect of changing environmental conditions such as alternating drying / wetting cycles or temperature changes can thus be studied over an extended period of time. This also permits to determine time periods of enhanced as well as low corrosion activity (time of corrosion) in order to predict the long term corrosion behaviour of concrete bridge structures.
