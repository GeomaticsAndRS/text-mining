  Instabilities in alpine Permafrost: Characterisation, Monitoring and Modelling of Active Rock Glaciers  
This research project focuses on the geotechnical response of alpine Permafrost, such as creep and failure behaviour, in a warming thermal regime. The research programme includes three main phases, namely field characterisation, monitoring and modelling of a rock glacier in Turtmanntal (CH).
