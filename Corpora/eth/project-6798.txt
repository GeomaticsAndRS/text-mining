  Polymers with Unusual Optical Functionality  

 Organic materials have potentially high performance characteristics as materials with unusual electromagnetic functionality, the range and scope of these properties has not yet been evaluated, however. We employ macromolecules as carriers of orientation-dependent functions. Thus, we synthesize regular, head-to-tail-linked polymers from non-symmetric monomers, the polar substituents of which are unidirectionally attached to the polymer main chain and that can be poled or otherwise macroscopically oriented. We use polyamides as carrier systems for NLO-chromophores in such systems and have obtained novel NLO-materials with uniquely high orientational stability of the chromophores. Efforts are underway to develop also novel materials with photorefractive properties.
