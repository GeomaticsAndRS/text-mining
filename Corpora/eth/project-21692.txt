  Intrinsic decomposing tendency of hematite-ilmenite phases and its effect  
The hematite-ilmenite solid solution series is a binary system relevant in physics and the earth sciences. This system has an intrinsic decomposing tendency which is studied on a nano-scale by a combined magnetic and spectroscopic experimental approach used in rock magnetism and material science.
