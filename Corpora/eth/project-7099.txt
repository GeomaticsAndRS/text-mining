  Role of Infochemicals on Aquatic Food Chains  

The EU project SNIFFS, Steering role of Infochemicals for Food chain Function  and Structure. Within this project we extent the work on fish-Daphnia interactions with the aspect of chemical communication. We concentrate our contribution in this project on the food web in an alpine lake (Arosa, Graubünden). The study is both experimental (life history studies) and an analysis of the field situation by studying the population dynamics of all important taxa in the food-web.
