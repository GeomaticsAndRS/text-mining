  Millimeter wave spectroscopy of high Rydberg states  

Molecular Rydberg states of high principal quantum number (n > 100) possess unusual chemical and physical properties. For instance, the radius of the electron orbit scales with n2 and the lifetime and the density of states scale with n3 . At high values of n these properties have very large values. Spectroscopic investigation of high Rydberg states from the electronic ground state requires high frequency light sources in the UV or the vacuum UV and suffer from limited spectral resolution because a) the light sources themselves have bandwidth of at best 0.01 cm-1 , and b) Doppler broadening is proportional to the frequency and is substantial in the VUV. This project aims at studying high Rydberg states spectroscopically using millimeter wave spectroscopy in the range 100 - 200 GHz. Because the Doppler broadening is more than 10'000 less than in the UV/VUV range and the millimeter wave radiation has a very narrow bandwidth (< 1 kHz), spectra of high atomic and molecular Rydberg states can be recorded at very high resolution. At our current resolution of 60 kHz we can observe the finest detail, including the hyperfine structure, of the energy level structure of molecular Rydberg states and determine, by Rydberg series extrapolation, new information on molecular ions. Keywords: Millimeter wave spectroscopy, high Rydberg states, hyperfine structure, multichannel quantum defect theory. References: F. Merkt and H. Schmutz, J. Chem. Phys. 108, 10033 (1998); A.
