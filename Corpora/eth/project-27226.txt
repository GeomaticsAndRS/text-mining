  Influence of the human- animal- relationship and rearing conditions on the coping ability of breeding animals (pigs), including cost- benefitanalyses 

Female breeding animals (breeding sows) are a valuable resource in agricultural production und represent the future income basis of the farmer. The animals must be reared over a longer period before they can be used productively. Particularly with the beginning of their reproductive phase these animals were confronted with a multiplicity of challenges: new, unfamiliar housing situations und an increase in the interactions with humans require coping reactions und represent additional stressors for the animals. This project will investigate whether the ability of female breeding animals to cope with such challenges can be improved by specific management procedures (human-animalrelationship, housing conditions) during rearing. The effect of the treatments will be measured in the reproductive phase by using ethological, physiological und veterinary indicators of stress und animal welfare. These scientific investigations will be supplemented by economic calculations of rearing costs. The cost-benefit analysis of the additional s(care)conditions during rearing will give an indication of the economic profitability of the procedures. Based on possible economic benefits, farmers can be motivated to apply the recommendations to improve the coping ability und welfare of their breeding animals, ideally also extending the economic life of their animals.
