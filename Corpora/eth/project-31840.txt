  KTI 15769.1 Relevance feedback mechanisms for video surveillance ** upicto 
The aim of this research project is to augment the upicto technology with  relevance feedback mechanisms. This will influence the learning procedure and make the system more flexible and thus applicable for more diverse scenarios.
The overall goal of this research project is to extend the application area and practical usability of our technology. We want to fill the gap between existing, rule-based video analytics solutions and the data-driven upicto solution. Rule-based systems are less flexible and generic than upictoSs solution, but have the advantage of invoking human intelligence and knowledge specific for the observed scene. Therefore, we aim at integrating operator feedback into the self-learning system. This is not only an innovative and promising approach for solving some of todaySs issues in flexible and accurate video analytics, but also involves difficult questions, where deeper investigations and research are required. A second part of the research in this project aims at domain adaptation of pre-trained knowledge. The underlying idea is to use available information from labeling in other cameras and transfer this information to newly installed cameras without human interaction.
