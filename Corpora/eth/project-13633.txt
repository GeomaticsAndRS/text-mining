  Influence of the lipid environment on the accessibility of the APP684-726 alpha-cleavage site  
The influence of the lipid bilayer composition on the mobility and accessibility of the alpha-cleavage site of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is studied in a liposomal system by solid state NMR and with biochemical methods.
