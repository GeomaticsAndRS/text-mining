  Cardiac Hypertrophy in vitro  

Cardiac cells are targets of growth factors, however little is known yet about a  possible role of IGF-1. IGF-1 receptors have been shown to be upregulated in ARC during the first 9 days in culture. After 16 days, IGF-1 treated cells, as compared to controls, show a strong increase in myofibril formation, but also a suppression of the accumulation of alpha-smooth muscle actin, which represents the early fetal actin isoform in heart development and is re-expressed in ARC in culture as well as in cardiac hypertrophy. This protein forms stress-fiber-like structures and may serve as a scaffold for the formation of new sarcomers until myofibrils have developed throughout the cell and the scaffold is no longer needed;and subsequently alpha-smooth muscle actin production is down-regulated. We plan to further investigate the up-and-down regulation of gene activites upon IGF-1 treatment of ARC as well as its role in compensation for hypertrophic treats.
