Investigation of size effects in heterogeneous catalysis using nanostructured multilayer systems  Catalytic reactions are referred to as structure-sensitive or size-sensitive if they proceed at different rates when carried out on metal particles of different crystallite sizes or different planes on a single crystal. Although investigated for many years, these size effects are not yet fully understood. Common catalyst systems used for such studies usually consist of particles with a broad distribution of size and shape. Other model systems such as single crystals with more defined size and structure properties provide only small active areas. With the model system used in this project we tried to bridge these gaps between model and real catalysts. By making use of laser interference lithography and sputtering techniques, metal nanotowers with dimensions of less than 200 nm were made on silicon wafers. After characterisation by several surface science techniques (AFM, SEM and XPS), these defined nanoclusters were used for CO oxidation and methanol synthesis.
