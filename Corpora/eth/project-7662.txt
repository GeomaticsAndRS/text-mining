  Application of the Shadow Optical Method on Impact-Loaded Plates  

The shadow optical method of caustics is an optical technique ofexperimental stress analysis which  is generally used in local areas nearstress concentrations like cracks or notches. We are now extending thismethod for the global investigation of the impact behaviour of differentkinds of plates. We started with the evaluation of impact of spheres onthin isotropic PMMA-plates with reflective surfaces. The typical caustics,which appeared in our experiments, were confirmed theoretically. Similarimpact experiments are performed in composite structures with differenttensile moduli in the two principal directions and in sandwich structures.Based on the shadow optical method we developed a new method usingincoherent light to obtain the curvature and the displacement of a platefrom the light intensity distribution in an image plane. Classicaldeformation measurement methods like holographic interferometry have thedisadvantage that in dynamic transient experiments only one picture can betaken during one experiment. For investigations on impact problems andfracture mechanics it is necessary to get more information due to the factthat such experiments are not repeatable. With our new method it ispossible to analyse several photos during one experiment. Applications onimpact loaded glass plates, using our Cranz Schardin system, aresuccessful. The photos were analysed with our digital image processingsystem. With a calibration of the gray values to the light intensity, wegot encouraging results.
