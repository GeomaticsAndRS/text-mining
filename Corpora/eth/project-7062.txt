  Presenting the Self in the Modern Age, 1900-1992  

This project investigates a variety of cultural dynamics which have changed social identities  and ideals of personhood in modern societies. We assume that social identities and conceptions of personhood can be understood as social constructs that become transformed during the process of modernisation. Empirically the project is based on 7300 personal ads randomly drawn from two major Swiss-German newspapers. The time period covered is 1900 to 1992. By means of quantitative content analysis a variety of cultural dimensions are being identified. Our research has so far concentrated on exploring basic dynamics of the social construction of personhood in modern society. We find considerable shifts in the relative importance of specific personality elements over time. In general, individualistic conceptions of the self have become increasingly important since the beginning of the century, while collectivist views of the individual have devaluated. Current research involves the development of more detailed measurements of identity constructions presented in the text base as well as empirical assessments of the structural and cultural forces that might explain shifts in the cultural understanding of the person.
