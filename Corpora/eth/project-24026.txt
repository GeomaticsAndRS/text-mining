  The influence of serially correlated shocks on the conservation of fish stocks under open access harvesting  
This paper investigates the dynamics of a renewable resource whose productivity is influenced by serially correlated random disturbances. The main question is: how does the expected value of stock escapement depend on the parameters that determine the distribution of environmental shocks?
