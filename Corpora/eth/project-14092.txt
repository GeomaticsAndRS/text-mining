  Seismic Behavior of Existing Bridges 
Most of the Swiss bridges havenSt been designed to withstand earthquakes and their assessment using current requirements and techniques calls for expensive retrofits. By means of bridge pier tests and transient analyses, the project aims to the development of novel seismic assessment methodologies.
Seismic hazard in Switzerland has been neglected for a long time. Therefore, most of the existing structures have not been designed to withstand earthquake attacks and thus, represent a potentially high seismic risk. The assessment of existing structures according to current requirements results most of the time in an insufficient structural safety calling for an expensive retrofit of the analyzed structure. Such an outcome is due to an increase of the seismic requirements as well as the use of obsolete assessment techniques. New seismic design methodologies, like e.g. the direct displacement design method, allow a better representation of the real seismic behavior of the structure. Such refined analyses are often able to show that the retrofit of the structure is not really needed. However, sound information on the non-linear cyclic behavior of the existing structures is needed. The project focuses on the seismic assessment of multi-span bridges and is made up of four parts: 1) typical Swiss bridges are modeled using FE methods and analyzed in terms of seismic demand; 2) the seismic capacity and performance of bridge piers built according to old Swiss practice and using the relevant material is investigated experimentally; 3) seismic demand and capacity are compared and guidelines to assess existing bridges are formulated; 4) finally, FE models are calibrated against experimental evidence to allow a better estimation of the performance of existing bridges.
