  Nonlinear Time Series  

Nonlinear time series arise in a variety of applications: financial processes are one important example which have substantially motivated our research. We currently inverstigate and develop new prediction models for the conditional expectation and variance (squared volatility) in univariate and also highly multivariate settings, including the following: (i) new dynamic mixture models for conditional means and volatility, where the mixture probabilities depend on observed past variables; (ii) tree-structured and also nonparametric GARCH models for volatility; (iii) modelling high-frequency financial data; (iv) synchroniazation of multivariate financial time series; (v) volatility prediction for very high-dimensional (of the order 100 - 1000) financial time series and functional gradient descent; (vi) novel evaluations for measuring predictive performance.
