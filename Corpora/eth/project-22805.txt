  Colloidal Capsules and their production using dynamic Nano Membrane Technology  
We study the formation of droplets and vesicles at micro and nano membranes. Therefore first bigger drops, bubbles and vesicles (approx 10 Â¸tm) are studied in single pore experiments and the formation process is downscaled to finally achieve length scales relevant for  encapsulation problems.
