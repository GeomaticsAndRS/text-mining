  Ferrotoroidic poling  
We investigate uniform alignments of magnetic vortices in solid state materials, known as ferrotoroidic order, with a special focus on domain formation and switching procedures. 
A uniform alignment of magnetic vortices, called ferrotoroidicity, was proposed as fourth form of primary ferroic order complementing classical ferroelastic, ferroelectric, and ferromagnetic ordering. Using optical second harmonic generation we investigate possible host materials such as the lithium orthophosphates (LiMPO4 with M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) with respect to the emergence of ferrotoroidic long-range order. Of special interest are spatial correlation phenomena (domain formation) and switching procedures that are determined by the ferrotoroidic nature of the order parameter in these systems.
