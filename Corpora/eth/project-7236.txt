  Comparision of different Coding Schemes for Digital Video Communication over IP (Interactive Media Streaming)  

 The performance of digital media streaming systems over IP depends very much on the compression schemes and codecs used as well as on the application and the network involved. Our focus in this research project is on special multimedia streaming applications like video-conferencing, interactive teleteaching, distance learning as well as client/server systems that deliver (on-demand or scheduled) live or edited contents to an unlimited number of users over any IP-based local or wide area network. Further aspects are how the performance criteria like compatibility of different MPEG codecs (software and hardware) influence the quality of service (QoS), stability and end-to-end delay. The following systems/codecs have been tested for audio, video and data streaming (unicast, multicast, broadcast): MPEG-1/2 ComMotion real-time transmission system from Optibase Systems, MPEG-1 codec VBrick and a DVB-S-based interactive broadcast telelearning system. Some of the tests showed that stability and compatibility could not always be obtained. Further IP-based systems, i.e. the Cisco System IP/TV which supports a wide variety of audio/video formats including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 and H.261 will be tested shortly.
