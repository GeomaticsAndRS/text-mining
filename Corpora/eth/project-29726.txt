  Analysis of lattice structures  
The aim of the project is to investigate the mechanical properties and the fracture mechanism of regular lattice structures which are used for numerical simulations of fracture processes in concrete where the failure mode in compression should get improved. 
The aim of the project is to investigate the mechanical properties and the fracture mechanism of regular lattice structures. Beam-lattice models are a convenient tool for analysing the mechanical and fracture behavior of various (disordered) materials and structures. Projecting a material structure on top of a lattice and assigning properties of various material phases of the individual lattice elements allows modelling almost any material in which simple one dimensional constitutive equations are sufficient. Stability problems like buckling were not investigated until now. Regular lattice structures are produced with rapid prototyping. In a first step, single beam elements are tested under tension and compression in a micro loading device to establish the mechanical properties of the used material. In a second step, lattice structures are tested under tension and compression. During the experiments, the strain distribution on the surface of the specimen is measured using 3 dimensional video image correlation. The influence of the beam geometry and the node stiffness in regards to the behavior of the lattice structure is established with the measured properties of single beams trough numerical simulation. With the calibrated parameters of the model, it is possible to design a structure which is more capable to simulate fracture processes in concrete under compression.
