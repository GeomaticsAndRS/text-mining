  In vivo studies of transgenic mice expressing structurally characterized designed prion protein variants 
Summary will be added later
In vivo studies of transgenic mice expressing structurally characterized designed mouse prion protein variants Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are infectious neurodegenerative diseases, such ´ as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, BSE (Smad cow diseaseS) in cattle and scrapie in sheep. The onset of a TSE is associated with a conformational rearrangement of the prion protein (PrP). The cellular form observed in healthy tissues, PrPC, is thereby transformed into an aggregated isoform that forms typical amyloid structures. My research team at the ETH Zürich has investigated the structural properties of a wide range of cellular prion proteins from different species, and included a series of designed variant mouse PrPs into these studies, some of which display unusual local conformational features. In the laboratory of Prof. A. Aguzzi at the University of Zürich, transgenic mice are being generated that express variant mouse PrPs which have been selected for specific structural features discovered by the NMR studies. In search of a molecular structural basis for aspects of the onset of TSEs, the behavior of the transgenic animals with regard to outbreak of a spontaneous TSE and susceptibility to infection by foreign infectious brain homogenate is investigated.
