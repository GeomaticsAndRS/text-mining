  Electronic and optical properties of quantum dots in II-V nano-whiskers  

Quantum dots realized in semiconductor nanostructures are promising building blocks for a quantum information processor. The charge and spin degrees of freedom of quantum dots have been analyzed by a variety of optical and electrical measurements. In state-of-the-art experiments the properties of an individual quantum state can be deduced from electrical Coulomb blockade measurements or from optical spectroscopy. Here we set out to study the electronic and optical properties of quantum dots realized in so-called III-V nano-whiskers. The self-assembled growth of such structures has been pioneered mostly by Samuelson and coworkers at Lund and Lieber and coworkers at Harvard. These groups have demonstrated superb structural quality, the possibility to grow one-dimensional heterostructures and to prepare high-quality electronic and optical quantum dot devices. Nano-patterned metallic catalyst particles are deposited on a semiconductor surface. The layer-by-layer growth then proceeds in the vertical direction while the lateral extent of the nano-whisker is basically governed by the size of the metallic nano-particle. Nano-whiskers are equally well accessible for optical and transport experiments. This will bring the fast time resolution of optical techniques to transport, while electrical gating schemes can be used for optical experiments. This combination of experimental approaches is unique for nano-whiskers and hardly possible for conventional quantum dots investigated so far This project aims at developing novel quantum structures which can be manipulated and read-out by several complimentary experimental techniques. This will be a crucial step towards the successful implementation of a quantum information processor in a scalable solid state environment.
