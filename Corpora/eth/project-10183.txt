  Identification of genes required for fruitbody development in Coprinopsis cinerea  
We are aiming at the identification and characterization genes involved in fruiting body formation in the mushroom C. cinerea. Genes will be identified using a screen for mutants defective in mushroom development and based on differential expression during vegetative growth and sexual development.
