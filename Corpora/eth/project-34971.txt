  Sensitivity analysis in computational hydrogeology  
Sensitivity analysis is conducted for a groundwater flow and mass transport model. Hydrogeological parameters with significant contributions to the variance of the response are identified by means of Sobol≈† indices. Methods for sensitivity analysis with mutually dependent variables are investigated.
