  Long-term dynamics of Mediterranean vegetation in response to climatic change and disturbance: combining paleoecological and dynamic modelling approaches  
Our project addresses ecological and climatic questions on annual to millennial time scales. We use Quaternary sedimentary sequences (e.g. pollen, chironomids, diatoms) and modelling approaches to study the long-term interactions among climate, the biosphere and the society in Mediterranean Italy.
