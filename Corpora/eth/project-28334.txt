  Compound specific hydrogen isotope analyses of leaf wax n-alkanes as a novel tool to assess plant and ecosystem water relations across new spatial and temporal scales  
Leaf wax n-alkanes are long-chained lipids that are vital components of plant cuticles. Their hydrogen isotope composition has been suggested to serve as an ecohydrological proxy. This project will determine the biological processes that determine the hydrogen  isotope composition of n-alkanes.
