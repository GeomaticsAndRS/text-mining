  Advanced EPR on oxalate decarboxylase and model systems  

Oxalic acid is normally occurring from dietary sources but humans and other vertebrates have to rely on their intestinal bacteria to metabolize it. Oxalate decarboxylase is the bacterial enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition of oxalate into carbon dioxide and formate. This enzyme contains manganese arranged in an approximate octahedral geometry as part of the active site. As this ion is present in a paramagnetic form, EPR techniques are very useful to study the geometric and electronic structure of the active centre and to detect intermediate radicals that could take part in the catalytic process. Model complexes of the active site are also under study to determine the hyperfine structure of manganese in this protein. (in collaboration with Prof. A. Angerhofer, Florida State University)
