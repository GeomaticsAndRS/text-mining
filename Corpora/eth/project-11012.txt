  Fast Magic-Angle Spinning for Proteins 
We have shown that fast magic-angle spinning (50 kHz and above) is fea-  sible and interesting for peptide and protein samples. Using fast MAS allows the implementation of more efficient polarization-transfer methods and low-power decoupling methods. Further methods development is underway.
