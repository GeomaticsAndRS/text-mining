  Polymeric nanocomposites: Preparation, Characterization and Applications  
We study and develop techniques for preparing polymer matrix/nanoparticle composites. The main objective is to understand how to disperse organic/inorganic nanoparticles in polymer matrices randomly homogeneously, avoiding their aggregation.
