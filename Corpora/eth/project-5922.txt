  Amperometric Biosensors 

 Typical traditional biosensors make use of the natural selectivity or specificity of enzymes, receptors and antibodies. Enzymatic sensors are in widespread use and some have also been commercialised. At the Centre for Chemical Sensors and Biosensors, redox-active enzymes are used in order to metabolise and quantify specific substrates. The work has been focused on enzymes that need no cosubstrates such as ascorbate, glucose, glutamate, sulphite and xanthine oxidase as well as peroxidase. To detect the turnover amperometrically, the enzymes are coupled to the metal electrode by the organic conducting salt TTF-TCNQ, that is certified as being non-toxic. The low applied potential can be shifted according to the enzyme, the real application condition and the redox potential of interfering ions and molecules. After first evaluations using a rotating disk electrode, a modular continuous-flow system was constructed for application near measurements. This set-up allowed: (1) to determine the "reversibility", repeatability and through-put in batch analysis and (2) to monitor increasing or decreasing analyte concentrations continuously. As an example, the amperometric module was applied to continuous and reagentfree monitoring of grape juice fermentation. Since the flow rate can be reduced to less than 1 ml/h, the sensor may be operated with minimum consumption of specimen in long-term measurements. The modular design enables to operate several working electrodes in series or in parallel and, therefore, to quantify various analytes simultaneously. The innovative project was awarded the price "Technologiestandort Schweiz" and was named the best engineering school project. Therefore, the modular system CHemsens could be presented at the Hannover trade fair 1997.
