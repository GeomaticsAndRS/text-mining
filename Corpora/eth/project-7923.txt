  NMR Probing of Magnetic Order among Small Moments: CePd2 In  

We have performed NQR and NMR studies of the newly synthesized compound CePd$_{2}  in the temperature range between 0.03 K and 30 K. The NQR spectrum shows the effects of a very large quadrupolar coupling e$^{2}/h=376 MHz for the In nuclear levels. This explains to a large extent the observed nuclear specific heat below 0.2 K and suggests that in the ordered state, below T$_{N}$=1.23 K, the internal magnetic field at the In site is small. The results of our NMR measurements show that in fact this is the case. We infer a field of 360 G at the In site corresponding to small localised Ce moments of 0.11$\gm_{B}$. In our model for the antiferromagnetic structure of CePd$_{2}, the magnetic unit cell is similar to that found in DyGa$_{2}$. The direction of the small localised Ce moments forming the magnetic order is along the line joining Ce-Ce next nearest-neighbours, at 30 degrees from the crystal c-axis. The nearest-neighbour interactions in the basal plane are frustrated, some are ferromagnetic and some antiferromagnetic. Our studies of the spin-lattice relaxation rate T$_{1}$$^{-1}$of CePd$_{2} in the temperature range between 0.03 K and 30 K shows the presence of low-energy excitations of the electronic system, present in the magnetically ordered state of this compound. Below 0.6K T$_{1}$$^{-1}$(T) follows a Korringa law with (T$_{1})$^{-1}$=17\pm2(K sec)$^{-1}$. This corresponds to a relaxation rate much larger than those found in simple metals, and it is attributed to excitations within the itinerant f-electron system.
