  Computer Based Control System for a Passenger Research Vehicle  

In an ETH-wide research project called Hybrid III, a novel type of  drive-train for passenger vehicles is developed. Hybrid III is based on a commercially available car body, with either a combustion engine or electrical motor operating such that pollution is minimized. Electrical energy may be used with the motor/generator; in addition, a flywheel allows for temporary energy storage and intermittent operation of the combustion engine. Our lab is responsible for the development of the basic hardware/software system used to control Hybrid III. Last but not least, we aim at a "showpiece" implementation of such a system to be used both in teaching and for technology transfer to industry. Thus, advanced tools and techniques are used throughout the development process, and state-of-the-art technologies will be deployed for sensors, transducers, on-board communication and processors. Two aspects of this project are of special interest: (1) Development of control algorithms and software is taking place in the different contributing ETH labs. Therefore, our software development environment has to support a "distributed workplace" and must enforce certain compatibility rules. (2) Formal specification and simulation is used extensively to allow for early validation of important concepts. In this respect, the CIP methodology and tool described in a companion project plays a key role.
