  Search for Marker Genes Linked to the Genes Specifying Receptors of F18 Fimbriated Escherichia coli Strains Causing Oedema Disease and Postweaning Diarrhoea in the Pig  

The objective of this study is to investigate linkage between loci for oedema disease and postweaning diarrhoea and the linkage group S-HAL (RYR1, CRC)-GPI-H-PO2-PGD located on porcine chromosome 6. In Switzerland, both diseases are an important cause of death in weaned pigs. Susceptibility to colonization of the small intestine by an E.coli strain causing oedema disease is determined (I) by oral inoculation of weaned pigs with a strain of E.coli serotype O139:K12(B):H1:F(18) and monitoring faecal excretion and (II) by an in vitro adhesion assay where enterocyte preparations are tested for adhesion of the E.coli strain. The experiment showed that susceptibility and resistance are controlled by two alleles of the locus ECF18R with (B) being dominant to resistance (b). Additional tests for marker loci are used to detect their polymorphism. Recently, it has been found that the locus ECF18R belongs to the linkage group S-HAL(RYR1, CRC)-GPI-H-PO2-PGD. The aim of this project is to determine the recombination frequencies and gene order of the loci, especially of the ECF18 locus, and to establish the haplotypes (including HAL genotypes) in a population of Swiss Landrace pigs.
