  Boundary Thermodynamics 
A general thermodynamic framework should provide time evolution equations for bulk and boundary variables in terms of thermodynamic building blocks, such as energy and entropy.
In general, the complete formulation of a thermodynamic system requires boundary variables in addition to bulk variables. Because we do not resolve atomistic length scales in a thermodynamic description, the boundary variables are defined on two-dimensional surfaces or interfaces even though they typically represent the properties of boundary layers. A general framework should provide time evolution equations for bulk and boundary variables in terms of thermodynamic building blocks, such as energy and entropy The bulk equations determine source terms in the equations for the boundary variables and, in turn, the boundary evolution equations provide boundary conditions for the bulk equations. As a result, one obtains a massively coupled, systematically structured set of bulk and boundary equations. To illustrate the ideas, we have developed a systematic description of wall slip. The generalization to moving interfaces has been developed in the context of bubble growth.
