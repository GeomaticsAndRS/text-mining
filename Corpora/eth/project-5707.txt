  Deregulation of Agricultural Markets  

The reason for changes in agricultural policy lies in the fact that the  previous price support has resulted in high social/economic costs. In addition, there was no appropriate instrument to remunerate the productivity of an agriculture that also serves the non-economic interest. The previous marketing orders have also protected the processors and the wholesalers to the extent that their competitiveness was weakened. Moreover, the high intensity of regulation has prevented the capacity of innovation. This study therefore intends to show how the various agricultural markets of Switzerland can be deregulated. A major focus of the study will be the milk market. With the help of market models, the impacts of deregulation on producers, consumers and the costs for the governement will be estimated.
