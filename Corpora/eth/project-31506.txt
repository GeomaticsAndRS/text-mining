  Key mechanisms of metabolic changes in mountain pine and larch under drought in the Swiss National Park  
The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanisms of metabolic changes in mountain pine and larch trees under drought stress in the Swiss National Park using stateof-the-art methods of classical dendrochronology, tree physiology, stable isotope, and compoundspecific isotope analyses.
In this project we investigate the mechanisms of metabolic changes in mountain pine and larch trees under drought stress in the Swiss National Park using state-of-the-art methods of classical dendrochronology, tree physiology, stable isotope, and compound-specific isotope analyses. Long-term response of mountain pine and larch trees from north- and south- facing sites to drought will be inferred from tree-ring width data. Based on climatic data drought index will be calculated and reconstructed back in time. New chronologies for 13C/12C and 18O/16O isotope ratios derived from both pine and larch tree-ring cellulose will provide retrospective insight into the long-term whole-plant physiological control of gas exchange derived from estimations of stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and intrinsic water use efficiency. Carbon isotopes ratios of specific sugar compounds such as sucrose, raffinose, fructose, ribose and pinitol in needle and wood samples will help to evaluate the impact of drought on the carbohydrate balance and carbon allocation. Analyzing the oxygen isotopic compositions of soil water, sap water (water in branches) and precipitation we will determine the role of the different water sources for tree growth under drought conditions. The proposed work will provide a unique opportunity to assess the survival potential of mountain pine and larch trees exposed to drought that will help to estimate risks of modern climatic changes and forest damage.
