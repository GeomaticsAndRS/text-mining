  Ion-Selective Electrodes for Trace Analysis  
The lower detection limits and selectivities of polymeric membrane ionselective electrodes (ISEs) have been improved by many orders of magnitude. Rugged systems are being developed for environmental monitoring of different ions including Pb2+ , Cu2+, Cd2+, and at trace levels. ClO4U 
The lower detection limits and selectivities of polymeric membrane ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) have been improved by many orders of magnitude. Theoretical models have been developed and verified by experiments to describe the ISE response in the presence of zero-current ion fluxes through the membrane. A general model has been derived to accurately describe the ISE response when different ions of different valences contribute to the potential. Rugged systems are being de veloped for environmental monitoring of different ions including Pb2+ , Cu2+, Cd2+, and ClO4U, in the micromolar to nanomolar activity range.
