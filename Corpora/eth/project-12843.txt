  Diffusions in Random Environment and Ballistic Behavior (Part of Thesis Tom Schmitz)  
The ballistic behavior of diffusions in random environment is investigated and analogues of the so-called conditions (T) and (Tâ€™) of the discrete setting are introduced. In particular this work enables the construction of new examples of diffusions with ballistic behavior.
