  Experimental Investigation and Validation of High Cycle Fatigue Design Systems for Centrifugal Compressors  
The scope of this project addresses high order blade vibration and the associated mechanical and aerodynamic damping in a centrifugal compressor. The need for reliable data to advance the understanding of forced response in centrifugal compressors is one of the motivations for the proposed work.
