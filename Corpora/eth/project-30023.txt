  Atmosphere-ocean interactions determining the net transfer of freshwater and resulting impacts on dynamics in the Southern Ocean region 
This project aims to make essential advances in our understanding and our ability to quantitatively model a number of key processes and interactions within the Earth≈†s water cycle, with a focus on those that involve strong scale interactions.
