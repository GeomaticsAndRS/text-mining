  Single-image 3D object detection and reconstruction with adaptive 3D shape models  
The project aims to detect objects in signle images and infer their 3D pose by exploiting prior knowledge about the shape and variability of the objects' category. 
The objective of the project is to detect and reconstruct in 3D, instances of object classes from single close-range photographs. The 3D geometry of object classes is modeled using simplification of commercially or freely available 3D CAD models, whereas appearance is modeled using nonphotorealistic renderings of original 3D CAD models. 3D Geometry is learned using the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) whereas appearance is learned using separate AdaBoost classifiers for different parts. Inference is performed using a Simulated Monte Carlo (SMC) based technique. Detailed experimentation is being performed on all aspects of the system (geometry, real and synthetic training data for appearance, part types and sizes, scale variations, different inference mechanisms, viewpoint variations in training etc) and preliminary results are encouraging.
