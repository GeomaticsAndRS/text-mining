  Structural and functional phenotyping of genetically engineered mouse models of Alzheimer disease using MRI and Optical Imaging  
Non-invasive phenotyping of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using MRI, fMRI and optical imaging approaches. Tools for assessing parenchymal load of amyloid plaques, amyloid angiopathy and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis will be developed.
