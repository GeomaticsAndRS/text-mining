  Ethnobotanical and Phytochemical Studies of Medicinal Plants from Mexico  

 The projects are based on ethnobotanical fieldwork among the Zapotec indians of the foothills of the Sierra del Isthmo in Oaxaca and among Mayan indians of lowland Yucat'an, Mexico. In this tropical areas plants still play a central part for the indigenous medical system. During 15 month of ethnobotanical study 750 species of medicinal plants have been collected and documented. Interviews with the local informants, such as traditional healers and midwives, along with observation and participation helped to write down for the first time part of the indigenous pharmacopoeias. While dermatological conditions and gastrointestinal disorders cause the major medical problems for this two indigenous groups, these indications were chosen as principal fields for further multidisciplinary investigations. Biological screening with crude extracts, as well as with pure compounds are carried out in-house in antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic test systems. Further testing is done in collaboration with the University of Freiburg/Germany and the pharmaceutical industry. So far 61 plant species are under investigation for their biological activity. From Xanthosoma robustum six sterols, three of them new hydroperoxysterols, have been isolated and show antibacterial activity. Epaltes mexicana yielded six eudesmane and two cuauthemone derivatives with antibacterial activity. Detailed phytochemical investigation of Begonia heracleifolia is in progress.
