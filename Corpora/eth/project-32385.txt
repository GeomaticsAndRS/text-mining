  Goldenrod ecology  

This project explores the ecology of tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima, and its interactions with insect herbivores and their natural enemies. In particular we are exploring the interactions of this plant with the specialist gall-inducing fly Eurosta solidaginis. We recently showed that a putative sex pheromone produced in copious amounts by the male flies, which perch on goldenrod stems to call for mates, primes anti-herbivore defenses in S. altissima plants: exposed plants subsequently suffer reduced rates of damage by insect herbivores and exhibit enhanced induction of defense phytohormones and stronger production of induced plant volatiles. This discovery is there first demonstration of plant perception and response to olfactory cues deriving from an insect antagonist. Ongoing work is attempting to understand the reproductive ecology of the fly and the selection pressures driving pheromone production, the chemical cues that mediate the aversion exhibited by female flies for pheromone exposed plants, and the broader ecological implications of plantdefense priming for community ecology.
