  Fluid-mechanical modelling of vestibular responses to sound  
The vestibular system of the ear hosts the balance sense whose operation  is closely related to the dynamics of two lymphatic fluids contained in the inner ear. We investigate a conditions known as Tullioâ€™s phenomenon which leads to a sensory crosstalk, i.e. acoustic stimulations lead to vertigo.
