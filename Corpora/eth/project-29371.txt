  Mapping 3-D mantle electrical conductivity from space. Development of new 3-D inverse solution based on analysis of matrix Q-responses  
Project introduces new, matrix, responses for global induction studies. Innovative developments will be: (a) a multi-variate time series analysis to estimate new responses; (b) 3-D inverse code based on the analysis of these responses; (c) new global 3-D conductivity model of the Earth≈†s mantl
