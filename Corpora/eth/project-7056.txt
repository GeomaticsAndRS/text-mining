  The Italian Novel in the late18th Century  

The goal of the research is to define the specific traits of the genre  novel which developed during the last quarter of the 18th century in Italy with an extensive, mostly female, readership. This topic has been neglected by literary criticism: a new reading of the primary sources and of the many theoric works on the genre, produced during that period, is the focus of the research.
