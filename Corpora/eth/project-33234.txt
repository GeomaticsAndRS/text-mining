  Wearable MRI  
The WearableMRI project aims to advance magnetic resonance imaging, a  widely used medical imaging technique. The specific goal is to enhance the performance, application range, and ergonomics of MRI by introducing wearable, elastic, adaptive detector and sensor arrays.
This project aims to advance the technology of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is one of the most widely used imaging modalities in medical diagnostics and research. The variety of anatomical and functional features, processes, and diseases that can be visualized with MRI is steadily increasing. However, the technique also faces fundamental limitations with respect to its sensitivity and speed. One effective way of addressing these limitations is parallel data acquisition with RF detector arrays. However, current rigid detector setups exploit this potential only partly and are limited in terms of ergonomics. Mechanical rigidity compromises sensitivity because it prevents adjustment to individual sizes and shapes of target anatomies. It also prevents changes in posture, such as the flection of joints, and impairs patient comfort. Fixed detector electronics incur suboptimal performance as effective loads vary from patient to patient, taking a further toll on effective sensitivity. The main goal of this project is to address these issues jointly by developing wearable, adaptive detector arrays with miniaturized on-detector receivers. In this concept, mechanical adaptiveness will be achieved by stretchable and elastic detector loops that automatically conform to the individual anatomy and posture. Arrays of such detectors will be complemented by adaptive electronics that sense effective port impedances and automatically adjust variable matching networks for optimal sensitivity yield. On-detector reception will be accomplished with an integrated circuit and optical conversion for safe, digital signal transmission.
