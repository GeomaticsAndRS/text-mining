Current immunodiagnostic tests in the animal health market are mostly based on ELISA technology. The overall goal of this project is to design a rational approach for the development of rapid immunodiagnostic tests based on fluorescence polarization technology. We will develop fluorescent tracers using linear peptides screened by pepscan analysis. The peptides will be labelled with fluorescent dyes and used in a test kit for the rapid, simple and cost-effective detection of serum antibodies in infected livestock animals.
