The REFORM project aims to develop, support and implement a variety of measures and activities which will enable regions to understand their particular needs to enable increased RTD activity and investment in the future. Through mechanisms such as Foresight and a new Mentoring Programme, the project will develop a number of individual Action Plans for partners, which will provide the infrastructure for new RTD policy and its implementation, and thus increase the economic growth of the EU as a whole. Additional actions, including study visits, workshops and a conference will support the transfer of good practice and knowledge to those regions in the developmental stages of increasing RTD investment, increasing the rate of transfer through hands on support, promotion and participation.
