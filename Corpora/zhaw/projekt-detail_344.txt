Instituto de Biomecanica de Valencia, Spain The WeTakeCare project aims to strengthen the collaborative care and training between elderly persons and their non-professional carers in order to promote the independent living of the elderly. In the training, the autonomous performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) by an elderly person will be encouraged and the carer will be supported in the provision of care in order to improve the quality of the provided care as well as to safeguard the carer’s own physical health. 
The project’s target users are both persons aged 50+ who have gone through an initial loss of capabilities and/or suffer from a light to moderate physical disability, and their carers. A loss of capabilities increases the difficulties to perform ADLs, frequently leads to a poor ADL performance and as a result to a taking over of the ADLs by the carer. This taking over leads to an “over-care” situation, which can ultimately diminish the autonomy of the elderly person. 
WeTakeCare will develop an interactive and multimodal system for the training of ADLs. 
WeTakeCare involves the end-users in the core process by including their views in the following stages: 1) definition of requirements, 2) concept and product development and 3) different validations. 
This approach will ensure a functional, easy to use, intuitive, motivating and accessible service and guarantee product acceptance and future market penetration.
