Das Projekt wurde Ende August 2008 erfolgreich abgeschlossen.  
The project objectives aim to radically innovate industrial robots in different application contexts. The design objectives will be demonstrated in real operating conditions. Increase in flexibility and adaptability, cost reduction and increase of the field of applications in the job floor, will be obtained by developing know how and experimental evidence for new generations of high performing embedded control systems. The control system will differ from existing solutions for the type of control technology used and the level of component integration. A higher level of control will be added to close the control chains.  
Disparate technologies will be investigated and integrated in end-user industrial scenarios: topics include control theory, video sensors, integrated circuits, visual processing algorithms, sensors fusion, communication networks, middleware software packages, real time operating systems and robot design. The project approach, leveraging on existing research and standardization efforts and on results already in place in the robotic industry, will guarantee enough flexibility for exploitation and adoption in the larger market of industrial automation, in particular for the market of small and medium-sized enterprises. The partners well represent the various interests and stakeholders, from end product manufacturers, to subsystems and components suppliers and R D institutions. 
Project ended in 2008.
