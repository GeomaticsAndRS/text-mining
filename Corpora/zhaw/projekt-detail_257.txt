METRIC (Mapping European regional Transport Research and Innovation Capacities) will map regional transport innovation capacities and identify regions with competitive advantages. Based on their strengths, guidelines for the preparation of innovation roadmaps (strategy plans) will be developed. METRIC will also explore the regional innovation potential in order to make recommendations on how to support weaker regions.    
The METRIC principles and activities consist of three main blocks: 
1.mapping of the transport research and innovation activities 
2.exploring the performance of the regional innovation frameworks 
3.analysing the main principles and typology for regional innovation   
The general objectives of METPEX are: 
•to gain insight in regional conditions supporting the impact of funding 
•to formulate generic principles as success factors enhancing regional innovation 
•to build a typology of regional innovation 
•to identify characteristics for classifying regions in types of innovation 
•to provide tools as guidelines to apply the identified principles in practice for regions
