The opportunities for photovoltaic (PV)solar energy conversion to support the requested transition for the realization of the Energy Strategy 2050 are widely recognized. However, if PV is to make a significant contribution to satisfy global energy requirements, issues of sustainability need to be addressed with increased urgency. This project aims at assessing the sustainability impacts of the devices and (potential) products being developed within the PV2050  projects. The sustainability impact assessment will cover  not only purely  environmental aspects (e.g. CO2 equivalent, energy yield), but also socio-economic impacts (e.g. influence on employment rate, acceptance, demand), as well as pricing and market deplo yment of solar electricity, and the impact on the grid. We expect that, in case of success in the technology developments, the next generation photovoltaic solutions proposed, will have a significant impact on penetration of PV in the Swiss grid, which will require various measures to guarantee a safe, clean but still affordable electricity supply.
