A novel approach, combining next-generation sequencing and comparison to custom databases is being tested to assess the impact of wastewater use in agriculture in the city of Kampala, Uganda. The overarching goal of this project is to bring epidemiological studies, classically targeting only one or a few pathogens to a whole new level by combining the analysis of resistance mechanisms as well as the identification of almost all known pathogens using only one experimental approach.
