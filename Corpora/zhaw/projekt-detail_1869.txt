The first release of the new SESES Public Domain Software for 2D models in cartesian coordinates is announced for July 2001 and can be downloaded using the internet portal www.icp.zhwin.ch. Coupled effects in sensors and actuators can be modeled based on the finite element method. The tool provides device designers with a framework to support the experimental product development cycle by numerical simulations, but university students with an educational tool in Computer Aided Design.
