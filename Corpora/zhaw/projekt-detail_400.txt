Bois noir is a yellow disease of grapevines (Vitis vinifera) caused by phytoplasmas belonging to the class 'Candidatus Phytoplasma solani'. These phytoplasmas live mostly on bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis) and stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). By accident they are transmitted by the ciciid  Hyalesthes obsoletus to V. vinifera. We investigate the incidence of infected H. obsoletus caught on a vineyard close to Heidelberg, Germany.
