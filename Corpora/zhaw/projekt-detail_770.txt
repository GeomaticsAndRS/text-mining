Delta Robotics GmbH The development and applications of the next generation of therapeutics will be driven by the progress of drug screening and the trends towards personalized medicine. Technology of drug screening will become much more efficient by using tissue and organotypic models in a three dimensional (3D) design simulating the in vivo situation as good as possible. The market for drug screening in Europe is projected to reach US$2.6 billion by 2015 (Source: Genetic engineering news). 
The project meets the demand of devices to design and produce living 3D organotypic skin models for the screening of medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic compounds and products. Highly defined structures will be produced in an easy and time saving manner, which is not possible with the state-of-the-art technique used today. 
The innovation of the proposed CTI project will be the integration of a Solid Freedom Fabrication Process, based on using a layer by layer deposition process of scaffold material, cells and bioactives and the integration of an in situ quality control device. This project will be conducted jointly with the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the University of Applied Sciences Biel, Delta Robotics GmbH and DSM.
