Publications at scientific conferences and journals are critical outcomes of normal postgraduate study programmes, but are not essential in applied research, as typically performed at universities of applied sciences such as LSFM. To accomplish this part of the PhD-study students (and their supervisors)are supported by funds beyond a typical CTI-project and have additional types of published outcomes such as IPRP patents on inventions and new business analysis (NBO)reports.
