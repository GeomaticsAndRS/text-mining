Recombinant Pichia pastoris is an emerging competitor in the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, especially where secreted proteins are concerned. Based on systematic physiological studies, an innovative technology (procedures) for robust high-productivity processes will be established and scaled-up. Furthermore, a compendium of the knowledge gathered, inter alia regarding the best practice on mixed substrate cultivations and physiological state monitoring, will be made available to the community concerned.
