The anticipated product candidate will specifically block pain sensation without the oftentimes treatment limiting adverse effects of currently marketed products. To achieve this, a breakthrough antibody discovery technology shall be applied. Methods developed in this first part of the project shall be synergistically used for the discovery of a second antibody specifically targeting breast cancer metastasis.
