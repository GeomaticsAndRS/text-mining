This cooperation aims to lower the costs of fish feeds by formulating fish feeds based only on plant ingredients, and at the same time to improve the quality of fry and productivity of adult fish through optimized fish nutrition by choosing adequate feed ingredients with lower mycotoxin contamination. The present project only includes the collections and analyses of samples of plant origin or from fish feed from Uganda and Kenya. The kick-start for this project requires exchange visits of Swiss and African researchers.
