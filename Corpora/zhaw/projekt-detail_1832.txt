Tissue engineering of articular cartilage in vitro is a promising technique to repair cartilage defects and to delay joint replacement. 
Although de novo cartilage cultivated under static culture conditions expressed qualitatively the same extra cellular matrix (ECM) as hyaline cartilage, its quantity of proteoglycan is 2.5 times less and collagen-II is even 40 times lower than in the native cartilage.  
To achieve the mechanical properties of articular cartilage in vitro and to enhance the production of ECM a bioreactor system was developed. Using compressed air, the growing piece of cartilage was stimulated by generating compression forces from above with a silicon membrane. The cultivation chamber could be perfused in order to exchange media. By altering the stimulation and perfusion rate the content of proteoglycan could be enhanced by about 50%. In a different approach the de novo cartilage was additional exposed to frictional forces which, in turn, resulted again in an increased proteoglycan content by about 50%. Studies researching the enhanced production of collagen-II have been made.  
The developed bioreactor system allows the cultivation of tissue engineered cartilage under biomechanical conditions in order to achieve the mechanical properties of articular cartilage with a precisely defined architecture and biomechanical composition of hyaline cartilage.
