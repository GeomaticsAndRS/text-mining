The project aims to develop methods for the synthesis of arrays of silica nanochannels with disc-shaped morphology and tunable pore size. These so-called Molecular Alignment Chips (MACs) are promising host materials for the supramolecular organization of guests. The project focuses on two specific applications of MACs, namely light-harvesting and size-selective separation. 
Dye-MACs inclusion compounds are prepared and applied as active centers in luminescent solar concentrators, with the goal of reducing the considerable self-absorption losses that are present in classical concentrator designs. Minimized self-absorption is the key to lowering the cost of solar electricity by equipping small solar cells with luminescent solar concentrators for light-harvesting. Furthermore, host-guest systems based on MACs with fine-tunable pore sizes will provide insight concerning the influence of confinement effects on the long-term stability of the guests and thus contribute to the development of photostable pigments. 
MACs membranes will be synthesized with fully accessible and oriented nanochannels. Superior performance in size-selective separation of nanoparticles and biomolecules will be obtained by providing MACs with narrow pore size distributions. Apart from the applications in light-harvesting and size-selective separation, we expect MACs to become a versatile platform for the alignment of molecules and macromolecules, thereby inspiring new concepts in the field of optics and optoelectronics.
