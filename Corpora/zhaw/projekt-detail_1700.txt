Policy-oriented business cycle research needs reliable indicators of current economic activity (real time data). In general, quantitative and qualitative data are affected by seasonal patterns and noise, therefore they have to be filtered accordingly. This leads unavoidably to boundary problems. Most of the common used asymmetric filters at the boundary of time series produce current data points to be revised after further observations become available. This problem is not really solved by methods like X-12, X-11 ARIMA or TRAMO/SEATS which rely on a time series model of the data generating process to forecast some future data points, so that a symmetric filter can be applied. 
A solution for these stability problems are frequency-based asymmetric filters. For demonstration purposes, the new procedure has been applied to 41 time series of business survey data. The new method outperformed TRAMO and X-12-ARIMA for 40 (out of 41) time series. The gain (reduction of mean square error) was more than 30% in the mean over all time series considered.
