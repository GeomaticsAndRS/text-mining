Grape phylloxera (Dactulosphaira vitifoliae, Fitch) was a major pest in European grape production until the consequent use of resistant rootstocks. Today phylloxera is found mostly on derelict vineyards and interspecific hybrids used mainly in organic grapewine production. This project aims to map the occurence of grape phylloxera in Switzerland and to evaluate the genotypic variability.
