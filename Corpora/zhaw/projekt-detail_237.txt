NoCaTS provides a revolutionary catheter tracking system with an integrated sensor applying the Trackcath method. The catheter visualization is normally performed with fluoroscopy, but the visualization of side branches is only possible with the use of contrast dye. The dye is flushed after 1 second, and for this reason the surgeons need to make many injections using a big quantity of dye. The Trackcath technology enables the tracking of a catheter respect to anatomical landmark, e.g. the renal arteries.
