Purpose of the Paper – The first objective of this paper was to demonstrate the use of repertory grid technique (RGT), a well-established interview method that elicits consumer cognitions. The second objective was to explore consumer perceptions of Swiss food labels. 
Design/Methodology/Approach – The study explored the perception of selected labels. RGT was used to identify the constructs in a sample of 20 master students and 10 Swiss food labels supplemented with an «ideal label». 
Findings - The study identified two main clusters. One cluster represents two labels, closely related to the ideal label. The other group is comprised of the remaining labels. Content analysis and analysis of semantic corridor indicated constructs connoted negatively. 
What is Original/Value of Paper – This is one of the first research that explored cognitions regarding Swiss food labels and represented a rare application of the repertory grid technique (RGT) using a semi-quantitative approach by means of a software. 
Research/Limitations/Implications – The application of the grid software facilitated the analysis but did not overcome practical limitations e.g. mentioned by Rogers  Ryals (2007). Managerial implications for label organisations are discussed and various fields for further research identified.
