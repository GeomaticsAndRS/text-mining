The goal of this project is to synthesize the knowledge gained over the last four years from the interdisciplinary research project Integrated Project Waste (IP Waste) and to make this knowledge available to a broad community on a national and international level. The product of the synthesis will be presented as a book (to be published by Springer Editions) for teachers, students, concerned citizens, waste managers, politicians, researchers, consultants, authorities, and industry. The contents will be a combination of fundamental knowledge and results obtained by the IP Waste. International experts from different fields will be invited to discuss the ideas developed in Switzerland and to contribute to the product of the synthesis. We think that Switzerland's research in the field of waste treatment and management is ahead of research efforts in other countries. To successfully transfer the knowledge acquired, we need to publicize our discoveries and to do so in an integrated, coherent, and encompassing manner. The synthesis on an international level and book we propose will be the ideal vehicle for such purposes. In particular, the book will grant to a large international audience access to the vast amount of results and research material produced as part of IP Waste. We will be responsible for chapter 6 Approaches to assess, evaluate and improve Social Compatibility within Waste Management . Further information on request.
