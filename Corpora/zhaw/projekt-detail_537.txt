Aristotelia chilensis is a wild growing shrub in central to southern Chile and western Argentina, which ist known for producing tasty and antioxidant rich berries, locally called Maqui . For the nutraceutical supplements industry, the high anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of the berry is in high demand and the exploitation of the wild resources in Chile has grown extensively. The cooperation between the two research groups provides for a great scientific and sustainable benefit to the ongoing research of Universidad de Talca. HPTLC methods will be adapted and optimized for Maqui berries at the ZHAW by a visiting PhD student from Universidad de Talca.
