Mabritec AG In collaboration with Mabritec AG, we have developed a database of an unprecedented nature, the PAPMID (putative assigned protein masses for identification database). Based on over 12,000 sequences of bacterial genomes, it contains the molecular masses of the ribosomal proteins of these microorganisms and this allows for the instant identification and subtyping of bacteria. In combination with the spectra obtained by MALDI-TOF MS, this original database is an important aid in the interpretation of phylogenetic relationships between the investigated bacteria. 
Not restricted to any one type of mass spectrometer, this database will soon be available to customers via the Internet.
