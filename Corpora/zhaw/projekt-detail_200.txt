This SCCER aims at developing the knowledge and technologies essential for the transition of the current transportation system to a sustainable one, featuring minimal CO2-output and Primary Energy Demand as well as virtually zero-pollutant emissions. 
Innovation Field (IF) A deals with components and devices: Capacity Area (CA) A1 aims at new battery technology, CA A2 at optimal use of renewable chemical energy carriers for fuel cells and combustion engines and CA A3 at the minimization of vehicular energy demand (aerodynamics, friction, lightweighting). IF B composes of CA B1 targeting infrastructure, logistics and ICT-systems and CA B2 covers the assessment of the transportation system. 
The program aims at creating synergies at the interfaces of these five CAs serving as Virtual Research Teams, composed by new and rededicated key researcher positions from ETH-Domain and the Universities of Applied Sciences. Many relevant Swiss and foreign companies have expressed their interest to actively participate.
