End-user motivation to save energy in homes and offices is one of the most important areas of research for the future of energy management. We propose to develop a new paradigm for a reward system that will use vast amounts of complex physical and financial data to influence user behavior. A similar para-digm has not been successfully implemented in a similar situation in any industry. However, there is a wide body of related research and valuable contextual information for this problem. The key dimensions of this problem include: an immediate effect on the physical quantity (energy), which depends on the behavior of the end-user at any moment; a large amount of complex data, which needs to be simplified and absorbed by the end-user in a limited time; a social context with the userâ€™s peers; a changing price of the energy depending on the time of day and other factors; and capturing and sustaining user inter-est in details that are typically outside their area of experience. A successful system for energy management depends heavily on increased involvement from the consumer. Without consumer involvement, even the best technical solutions will not be able to translate into better energy management.
