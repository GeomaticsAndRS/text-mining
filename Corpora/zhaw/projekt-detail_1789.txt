Growing cartilage in vitro for treatment of focal articular lesions is a highly interdisciplinary and challenging approach. One major limitation is still to maintain/direct the chondrogenic potential of chondrocytes during the cultivation process. A combination of disciplines that encompasses tissue engineering, gene technology, and drug screening technologies has precipitated the concept of real-time monitoring marker gene expression in 2D as well as 3D tissue-like cultures. Development of such a technology will be an important step towards a more efficient study of cartilage-modifying molecules such as growth factors or hormones but also will allow to perform high throughput screening of drugs for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
