Classical Lectures use the contact hours to transfer theoretical knowledge. Exercices are solved at home. The idea of flipped classroom is to do this the other way round: Theory is learnt with teaching videos in preparation to the contact hours. During contact hours, exercices are solved, group work is promoted and cognitive processes are facilitated.  
Such a flipped Classroom design is evalutaed in view of various aspects.
