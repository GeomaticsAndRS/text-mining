Prof Dr. Christophe Lacroix, ETHZ; Nicole Reith, Hochdorf Nutribake AG; Rudolf Steiner, Bioforce AG; Christoph Stalder, Coop Multifunctional ingredients will be developed by fermentation technology using selected strains of Lactobacillus and Propionibacterium co-cultivated in optimized cereal-based medium. Their metabolic activities will lead to naturally-produced functional substances of particular interest to the bakery and nutritional supplement sector: high levels of organic acids (propionic and acetic) and other compounds with antimicrobial and flavor-enhancing effects; folate and vitamin B12 in balanced and nutritionally-relevant levels; and exopolysaccharides (EPS) for improving product texture and shelf life. The technology will be transferred to industry scale, including down processing. Stability of multifunctional ingredients (both whey- and cereal-based) will be tested in selected applications of bakery and nutritional supplements. 
The project is now in the implementation phase, led by the Industry partners, Bakels, Coop and Bioforce, i.e. the commercialization of the developed ingredients; and there is high potential for further projects.  Final assessment by KTI committee, end of 2014.
