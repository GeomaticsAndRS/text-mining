EU's goal is to develope a transport system which meets the economic, social and environmental requirements of the society.  An adequate accessibility and safe mobility should be provided for all European citizens, especially for the ageing populations. In order to do that the future trends and challenges need to be considered. 
To offer high quality transport services and to better understand the challenges and barriers faced by the pasengers in Europe, the project METPEX (A MEasurement Tool to determine the quality of the Passenger EXperience) aims to develop a measurement tool for gathering information about the complete door to door passenger journey. The whole journey experience from travel planning to arrival at the destination will be included. 
The gathered data can be used by transport providers, policy makers, vehicle designers and municipalities for benchmarking their transport services and taking necessary measures to improve and make them more efficient.
