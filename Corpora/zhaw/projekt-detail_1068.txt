Arthroscopy denotes the minimally invasive inspection and treatment of damage in joints under endoscopic guidance. This procedure demands specialized skills which need to be acquired by apprentice surgeons. One option for training is computer-based surgical simulation.  
This project focuses on the development of a knee arthroscopy training simulator of highest possible realism. A central goal will be to go beyond currently available systems by covering complete interventions, including large variability of patient cases, providing a realistic simulation interface (knee replica  instruments), and accurate modeling of the situs.  
The ZHAW together with Virtamed is mainly responsibly for the design and implementation of the simulation software which eventually will result in a functional prototype for arthroscopy simulation.
