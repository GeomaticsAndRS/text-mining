BFE Task=24 Sort=0 Demand-Side Management (DSM) aims at releasing the vast potential for cost-efficient energy efficiency that is locked in on the demand side (i.e. with the energy user). Following, this new Task of the IEA DSM Implementing Agreement is aimed at developing a framework that clearly links energy end user behaviour change research theory with successful policy implementation and outcome evaluation. 
Governments around the world struggle with achieving their targets (often set in legislation) towards developing a more sustainable energy system. There is now a growing international realisation that technological development will not be sufficient to meet those targets. Energy efficiency and energy conservation have gained renewed interest due to climate convention commitments and the rising concerns about prices and security of supply of imported fuels. 
The main objective of this project is to create an expert network and design a framework to allow policymakers, funders of DSM programmes, researchers and DSM implementers to: 
- Interact, learn about and build up a common interdisciplinary and international knowledge base on how to turn behaviour change theory into practice: Inventory of models and disciplines. 
- Base DSM programme funding and design decisions on sound, widely-accepted state of the art behaviour change models, theory, and best practice. 
- Make better decisions about, monitor and evaluate DSM research and projects/programmes with sensitivity to different contexts and to their own role and position. 
- Case-studies (in the areas of building retrofits, smart metering, SME, transport) and inventory of context factors influencing effectiveness of DSM programmes. 
- Development of guidelines  tools.
