The existing Kerberos Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) allows a password-based login on a Unix host when it is part of a Windows 2000 realm controlled by a Windows 2000 Key Distribution Center (KDC). However, one of the main advantages of the Windows 2000 KDC, namely the Public Key Initialization (PKINIT) support, has not been implemented yet.  With this project that has been approved by Microsoft Research in Cambridge, UK, we want to fill the gap by extending the existing Unix Kerberos module to make public key based logins possible. The necessary certificates and dedicated private keys will either be stored in the local file system or in order to increase the security on a smartcard. In both cases the private key will only be accessible after the succesfuly entry of a secret pass phrase. For the creation of the required certificates and optionally also the smartcards, a Microsoft Windows 2000 Certification Authority will be used.
