Patient education (PE) is an integral part of the management of inflammatory arthritis (IA). The content of PE and the methods of delivery vary widely across the European countries, preventing comparison and establishment of standards. EULAR aims to be a provider and facilitator of high quality education for people with IA, but currently there are no formal EULAR recommendations for the content, mode of delivery, timing and evaluation of PE. 
This research aims to: (i) develop evidence-based recommendations/points to consider for people with IA in order to contribute to core standards for PE of people with IA across EULAR countries, (ii) identify the educational needs of rheumatology health professionals in order to effectively implement evidence-based PE and (iii) identify areas in which there is lack of evidence or a need for further research on PE. 
The Task Force will represent different health professionals and people with IA across Europe. The evidence-based approach to develop recommendations (EULAR SOPâ€™s) will be followed. The project includes developing a core definition of PE and stating the standards of PE that people with IA should (expect to) receive from rheumatology HPs.
