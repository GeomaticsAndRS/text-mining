Creation of a first unit of an Integrated System-dynamics Learning Environment (ISLE) for themodynamics as a part of introductory physics. The learning environment is both real and virtual, presents experiments, data, movies, assignments, and theory, and makes use of tools for (system dynamics) modeling, data analysis, and (real and virtual) experimentation. A Real ISLE takes place in a physics studio. The project runs concurrently at FH Fribourg (with G.Ecoffey), and is supported by E.Sch√ºtz (Experiments, BS Uster) and J.Paice (didactic assessment).
