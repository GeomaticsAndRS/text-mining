The goal of this project is to develop an innovative market monitoring application for an e-commerce platform. The project is done in collaboration with an industry partner. Unlike traditional e-commerce applications where users need to log into the system and thus leave traces when they search for specific products or even buy them afterwards, our application allows full anonymity of the users in case they do not want to log into the system.  
However, analyzing anonymous user interactions is a much harder problem than analyzing named users. The idea is to apply modern Big Data technologies as well as machine learning algorithms to discover patterns in the user behavior and to make recommendations for designing new products.
