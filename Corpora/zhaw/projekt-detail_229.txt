Optical Additives GmbH The aim of this project is to extend the use of tinted windows or glass building fronts to the generation of electricity. Using light-stable luminescent solar concentrators in an economical, ecological, and aesthetically pleasing way leads to novel architectural building elements that can generate electricity from direct and diffuse illumination. The major project goal lies in the development of light-stable dye-zeolite composites (ZeoFRET) that can be used in the production of luminescent solar concentrators.
