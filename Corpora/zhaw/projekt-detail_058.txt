The goal of the project is to improve the quality of life for older adults by strengthening their social inclusion, improving social interaction and self-esteem. The ExpAct project will develop ICT-solutions in conjunction with accompanying services to enable older adults to make full use of their potential â€“ their experience. The aim is to get primary end-users engaged in professional work again or help them to become engaged in unpaid voluntary work as their skills and expertise are too valuable to be left unused.
