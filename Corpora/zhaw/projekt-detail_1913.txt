It is  an urgent need all over the world to find out what can be a good  method to run effectively and efficiently hospitals, financed partially or totally by social security. One reason of the difficulties is the difference between the actual costs and eligible costs. From both private insurance company and social security perceptive the acceptable cost level of the treatment can be only the basis of reimbursement. In our project we tried to find a solution, how to qualify a hospital from financial and operational point of view. Our approach was based on two attributes: First, independently of the chosen method of financing, only the actual cost per patient can be relevant as a basis of analysis. Second, no one hospital can be compared to any other as a method of analysis, since the conditions can vary significantly. The hospital performance can be evaluated only in comparison to the  opportunities what the hospital has. The model, we developed consists of three parts. (1) Descriptive data collection, (2) Simulation, (3) Evaluation. The data concerning the hospital environment consists of (a) the patient distribution by ICD, (b) sequence of medical interventions (so called medical protocol), (c ) resources of interventions, like drugs, tools, doctors, nurses, equipment,  etc. (d) workplaces of interventions,  (e) any indirect costs of the hospital, like administration, logistics, pharmacy, transport, laundry, procurement, etc. Based upon the collected and hospital specific data the simulation model can be parameterised. The model produces prolific statistic result, which are the basic input for evaluation. Using the available statistic modules, especially the bottlenecks, queue statistics are of the main interests. Testing with hypothetical hospital data, the model provides a solid guideline where the patients are loosing time (and money) and where the personnel are not utilised properly. It is already the managementâ€™s right to conclude the right decision(s).
