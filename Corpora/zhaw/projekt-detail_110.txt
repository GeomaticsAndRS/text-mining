Mathys AG, Bettlach The optimal therapy for rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is under debate. Beside the current standard therapies (primary operative reconstruction of the ACL [pOP]; primary conservative treatment with rehabilitation and possible delayed ACL repair [pKONS]), a new therapeutic option has emerged: The Dynamic Intraligamentary Stabilisation (DIS) therapy, which aims in healing of the ruptured ACL. 
For reimbursement under the social insurance scheme in Switzerland, new technologies have to show effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency (“WZW”) compared to standard of care. This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) aims to assess patient benefits and costs of the new DIS technology compared to pOP and pKONS.
