Although a growing body of empirical research exists in the field of translation processes and the acquisition of translation competence, comparatively little work has been done on the impact of translation tools on professional workplace practices. This project will initially use questionnaire surveys of professionals working in a variety of settings to gather data on current workplace practices in the research and revision phases of the translation process. It will then apply a multi-method approach comprising keystroke logging, computer recordings,  eye-tracking and retrospective verbal protocols to investigating more specifically professional routines and requirements in the deployment of research and translation memory tools. It aims to identify problems and user needs in the research and revision phases of professional tool-based translation with a view to optimizing workflow efficiency and output quality.  
After successful completion of the first phase of this project in August 2009, it is continuing as part of the Capturing Translation Processes (CTP) project led by Maureen Ehrensberger.
