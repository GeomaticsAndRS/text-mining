 Lead Lay summary The mammalian brain is capable of a remarkable degree of functional plasticity, adaptation of neuronal activity to changes in experience. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying experience-dependent plasticity in the intact brain is crucial because of the implications for learning and memory, and promoting recovery from injury and neurological disease, but methodological constraints have still limited our knowledge. This research project proposes novel in vivo measurements of experience-dependent plasticity induced by whisker trimming in the well-defined neuronal circuitry of the mouse neocortex using a combination of optical, electrophysiological and molecular methods. We will use chronic two-photon calcium imaging methods to follow activity changes in the exact same neurons over weeks and months as plasticity takes place. Complementarily, we will use recently developed wide-field imaging techniques to measure plasticity-driven changes in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory circuit activity in the living mouse brain longitudinally as plasticity takes place. Chronic cellular imaging in behaving mice will further define a behavioral role for specific functionally defined subtypes of highly responsive neurons. Together, the results will provide novel information about the fundamental operating principles and plasticity of cortical circuits that can only be revealed through our combination of techniques in anesthetized and behaving mice. Together, the results will have a large impact on our understanding of the capacity of neuronal circuits to adapt to altered experience, and key implications for translational research.
