 Lead Lay summary The current project aims at a systematic investigation of biased expectations in spider phobia. The project brings two important innovations to the study of spider phobia. For the first time, two different forms of expectancy bias will be explicitly differentiated: spider phobics' overestimation of the likelihood to encounter spiders and their overestimation of the likelihood to incur aversive consequences of an encounter with a spider. 
Another distinctive aspect of this research is its inclusion of a variety of different measures that include behavior as well as brain imaging (fMRI) and somatovisceral responses (heart rate, muscle activity, skin conductance, and skin temperature). Thus, the study of spider phobia will not be restricted to the assessment of global fear ratings or purely behavioral measures. Consequently, results from the proposed experiments will allow us to draw a more complete picture of the cognitive and physiological particularities in spider phobia. 
Differences between phobia-related information processing and non-phobia-related information processing in spider phobic individuals, as well as differences between phobics and non-phobics will be systematically investigated. Results of these studies may have important implications for our understanding of basic fear-eliciting mechanisms in spider phobia.
