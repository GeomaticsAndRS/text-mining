 Lead Lay summary Ubiquitination is important in degradation processes and regulation of protein functions. The DDB1-CUL4 ubiquitin ligase catalyzes ubiquitination by recruitment of specific adaptor proteins of the DCAF family (DDB1-CUL4 associated factor), which in turn interact with the ubiquitination substrates and mediate ubiquitination specificity. DDB1-CUL4/DCAF complexes play an important role in the onset of Cockayne Syndrome (CS) and Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) disease as well as in various other cellular processes. I will use a combination of X-ray crystallography and protein biochemistry to analyze the structure and function of selected DCAF proteins. Studies of the DDB1-CUL4/DCAF system will help to shed light onto the structure and function of DCAF adaptor proteins and will contribute to our general understanding of DDB1-CUL4 mediated ubiquitination processes.
