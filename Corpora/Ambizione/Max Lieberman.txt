 Lead Lay summary This project seeks to adjust our understanding of the origins of chivalry by placing the emphasis not on the 'ordinary knights' but on the highest nobility, including the sons of kings, who were apparently the first to be ceremonially 'made knights'. The focus will be on England and north-western France during the high medieval period (c. 1000-1300), the age of the Norman conquest of England, the crusades and the 'constitutional' conflicts between crown and nobility which led to Magna Carta. The project draws on the rich historiographical sources written in Old English, Latin and Anglo-Norman French during the period under consideration. It will also consider chivalric treatises, mirrors of princes, and the visual evidence of manuscript illuminations.
