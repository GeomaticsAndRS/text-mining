 Lead Lay summary During the course of a normal life span, most of us will incur stressful or traumatic events, such as a car accident, an assault, the loss of a partner or close friend etc. Exposure to such events can result in disabling mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders or depression. However, there is great individual variability in psychological responding to trauma. Even when exposed to extreme stressors, many individuals do not develop enduring psychopathological responses, and display relatively good psychological outcome. Why are some individuals resilient in this manner, while others succumb to stress? Within the growing field of research on posttrauma psychopathology, only little attention has been paid to such questions about resilience and the maintenance of a relatively healthy and stable trajectory after trauma. The present project aims to test how well resilient stress responses in real-life and in laboratory settings can be predicted by psychological and biological factors. The candidate resilience predictors that will be assessed include cognitive and neural processing in stress-related situations, emotion regulation capabilities, hormonal status, and genetic setup. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resilience is crucial for the development of measures aimed at increasing resilience in trauma-exposed occupations and civilian trauma survivors, such as screening, educational, training, and clinical programs. This may be particularly relevant for Switzerland with its many national and international organisations (e.g., UNO, IRC, WHO), as many of their employees (e.g. medical personnel in conflict areas, peacekeepers) are likely to be exposed to trauma as part of their profession.
