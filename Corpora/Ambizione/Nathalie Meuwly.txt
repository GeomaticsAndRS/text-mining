 Lead Lay summary Positive close relationships have a positive impact on partners' well-being. However, not every individual seem to benefit in the same extent of being in a close relationship. Insecure attachment is suggested to moderate this effect, since insecurely attached individuals show increased dysfunctional cognitions and behaviors in the interpersonal context. Previous studies focusing on extradyadic stress and support processes revealed that attachment insecurity is associated with increased negative perceptions of dyadic interactions. In the proposed study, we are particularly interested in dysfunctional cognitions of individuals imagining a separation from their romantic partner. Current cognitions of 100 participants (50 male and 50 female) during different tasks indicating an increased threat to the relationship are assessed using the Articulated Thoughts in Simulated Situations Paradigm (ATSS; Davison, Robins,  Johnson, 1983). This paradigm has, to our knowledge, not been used in attachment research, but the procedure offers a good opportunity to examine dysfunctional cognitions. Increased dysfunctional cognitions are hypothesized to mediate the negative association between attachment insecurity and an individual's psychological (depressed and anxious mood) and physical well-being. Moreover, a short-term decrease in self-reported relationship satisfaction in insecurely attached individuals is expected. The attachment literature does not focus on gender specific effects per se. However, as depressed mood is also associated with dysfunctional cognitions in a similar way as attachment anxiety, we are particularly interested in gender-specific associations, since women have a higher risk for depressive disorders, and the association between depression and relationship quality seems to be stronger for female than male partners.
