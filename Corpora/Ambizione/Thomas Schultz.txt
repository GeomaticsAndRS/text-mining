 Lead Lay summary Globalization has brought about fundamental changes in the relationship between the economy, society, law and states. Private and public actors are engaging in an ever-increasing number of international transactions and are elbowing aside a weakening state in order to develop their own regimes beyond and above the state, which are referred to as "transnational law".  
Much scholarship has been devoted these last decades to studying the effectiveness, or concrete regulatory importance, of various such instances of transnational law. But the ethical implications of these developments remain largely unclear:  
- Can the fundamental moral-political values enshrined in liberal-democratic national regimes be safeguarded in transnational regimes? 
- Can the kind of legitimacy of governance found in benign national regimes be found in transnational regimes? 
- Consequently, how should transnational law be integrated in the existing frameworks of private and public international law? 
- Or should transnational law lead to a general blurring of the categories of public international law, private international law, and the regimes not rooted in states that are classically put forward by legal pluralists?  
The research project seeks to challenge the widely shared belief that law must necessarily be state law, for ethical reasons; it hence seeks to clarify the ethical concerns brought about by transnational law and what treatment it consequently deserves to be given in the frameworks of public and private international law.
