 Lead Cell Biology of Poxvirus Infection Lay summary Viruses are simple, obligatory, intracellular parasites that depend on the host cell for most of the steps in their replication cycle. Not only do they rely on the cell?s biosynthetic machinery, they exploit cellular processes such as signaling, membrane trafficking, intra-cellular transport, nuclear import and export, molecular sorting, transcriptional regulation, etc.
The enclosed proposal is aimed at identifying the full spectrum of host cell factors and functions involved in vaccinia virus (VACV) infection in an unbiased and systematic fashion. To determine the ?infectome? (critical host cell proteins needed for virus replication) of VACV we will monitor the complete infection cycle after silencing individual genes using a human genome-wide siRNA library. The infection assay to be used in the screen is fully automated, and makes use of high-content microscopic read-outs for infection and virus production. After screening validation and bioinformatic analysis, host cell factors will be classified based on their requirements in the virus lifecycle. Extensive biochemical and cell biological follow-up analyses will focus mainly on the host proteins and mechanisms involved in virus entry and assembly.
Identification of the viral ?infectome? offers a valuable, new perspective into the complexities of the VACV infection process, and will likely open up wide new areas of basic and applied research. Identified cellular factors critical to infection also serve as potential targets for new poxvirus antiviral strategies directed against cellular, rather than viral, factors and functions.
