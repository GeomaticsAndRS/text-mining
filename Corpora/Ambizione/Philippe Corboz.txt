 Lead Lay summary One of the major goals in condensed matter physics is understanding the emergent properties  of a very large number of strongly interacting quantum particles, called strongly correlated quantum many-body systems (QMBS). The interplay between different type of interactions and quantum statistics gives rise to novel, exciting physics such as high-temperature superconductivity, quantum magnetism, the fractional quantum Hall effect, Mott insulators, or topological insulators. The theoretical study of these systems is very challenging, because typically standard analytical approaches fail for these systems, and thus accurate numerical simulations are essential. However, the usually most powerful numerical method, Quantum Monte Carlo, fails for many important models due to the so-called negative sign problem. As a consequence the properties of many models are still controversial, and it is therefore crucial to develop new accurate and efficient numerical tools to study these systems.  
In this project I will focus on a new class of simulation techniques for QMBS that have been developed through combining ideas from quantum information theory and condensed matter physics: the so-called tensor network algorithms. The main idea is to efficiently represent quantum many-body states by a product of tensors. First results for the t-J model, an important model in the context of high-temperature superconductivity, show that the tensor network called PEPS (projected entangled-pair state) yields better energies than other variational approaches based on Gutzwiller projected ansatz wave functions (GWF).  
To further improve upon these methods I will combine them with fixed-node Monte Carlo (FNMC) which yields the best variational wave function compatible with the nodal structure of an (input) guiding wave function. FNMC has been applied to the t-J model in the past, using GWF as guiding wave functions, which resulted in a considerable improvement of the variational energy. This new FN+PEPS method, which combines PEPS with fixed-node Monte Carlo, will be better than both PEPS and current fixed-node results, and thus define a new state-of-the-art variational method for the study of quantum many-body systems in two dimensions. I will apply this method to several important models in condensed matter physics where accurate studies so far have been severely limited by the sign problem. These simulations will help to shed new light into controversial, open questions such as:  
- Do frustrated spin models such as the Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice and the J1 - J2 Heisenberg model on the square/honeycomb lattice give rise to a spin liquid phase? If yes, what is the nature of this phase? Does it exhibit topological order?  
- What is the nature of the spin liquid that emerges in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice? What happens if the system is doped?  
- Does the t-J model and the Hubbard model reproduce the physics of high-temperature superconductors? Is there formation of stripes or phase separation at finite doping in the physically relevant parameter regime? What is the effect of higher-ranged interactions and hoppings? What is the mechanism leading to superconductivity?
