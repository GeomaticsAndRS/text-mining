 Lead Lay summary While the relative importance of
biochemical and biomechanical cues on cells differentiation remains unclear, it
is now widely recognized that mechanical loads applied to stem cells largely
affect their differentiation pathway through mechanotransduction ( i.e.  the mechanisms by which cells sense
biomechanical signals and convert it into biochemical activity). These
mechanisms have been especially highlighted on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), a
promising population of bone marrow-derived multipotent adult stem cells that
are precursors of a multitude of nonhematopoietic cells including osteocytes,
chondrocytes and smooth muscle cells. Yet, the potential use of mechanical
stimuli for stem cells speciation commitment remains largely unexplored.  In this project, we  propose to study the effect of cyclic loads
on MSCs differentiation. The experiments will be performed on an array of
single cells patterned on a silicon-based microelectromechanical system, using
a dedicated microengineered platform that has been developed for that purpose
in an earlier study (SNSF Interdisciplinary project No. CR32I3_130320). Thanks
to this research, we should be able to tell whether cyclic loads alone can
induce MSCs differentiation. Conversely, mixed success would give useful
information to bioengineers interested in culturing undifferentiated MSCs in vitro .
