 Lead Lay summary Even after decades, the predictions of Gordon Moore still prevail. The number of transistors per chip device keeps doubling almost every two years. But it is getting harder and harder to turn these transistors into an actual improvement in application performance. There are ample transistors on a chip today, but energy, heat dissipation, and bandwidth issues increasingly limit the ways those transistors can be used to increase performance.  
The only viable route to sustain performance growth seems to be the use of hardware acceleration. Specialized processing units can be made much more energy efficient than general-purpose CPUs. And, by making them part of a heterogeneous system design, they can speed up applications significantly without exceeding tight power or heat limitations.  
A very appealing class of specialized processing units are field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) , (re-)programmable chip devices that can be tailored to run any (application) task directly in hardware.  With the Avalanche  project, I pioneered the use of FPGAs in the context of databases and data stream processors. Here, the high throughput opportunities of FPGAs, as well as their potential for ultra-low latency, can break the often-cited memory wall and release the CPU from some of its most data-intensive tasks.  
The main goal of this follow-up effort is to extend the results of Avalanche  and turn them into a working system. The planned work involves three phases. A first phase connects bits and pieces that have been developed already by students in order to prepare a low-level hardware foundation for the remainder of the project. The second, most important phase is then the evaluation of different design strategies for a combined hardware/software database system. Lastly, a third phase will realize the developed techniques and concepts in the form of a working prototype.
