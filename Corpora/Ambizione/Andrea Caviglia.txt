Lead Lay summary A powerful driving force behind our recent technological progress is the ability to control on-demand the electronic properties of a material, the best example being the field-effect transistor. In this device, the ability of a silicon layer to conduct an electrical current can be controlled by applying a static electric field. Several hundred million of these devices operate in one of our pockets, closely packed inside a single smartphone. A major challenge facing condensed-matter physics today is to extend this control to quantum materials with functional properties such as magnetism or superconductivity, and to develop a deeper understanding of their complex behaviour. An exciting new research direction is to control on-demand the electronic properties of these materials using light. For this purpose, laser science and technology offer tremendous opportunities. An appealing possibility is to selectively excite low-frequency modes of the solid such as lattice vibrations or the more exotic dipole-carrying excitations of condensed matter that range from phason modes of charge density waves to Josephson plasma waves. In the project proposed here, the selective excitation of low-frequency modes will be studied in different complex oxides, such as titanates, manganites, nickelates and cuprates. This project will benefit from recent developments in ultrafast science that have made it possible to generate pulses of light in the mid-infrared and THz range. Indeed, the intensity levels that are now available open the possibility to control the dynamics of the low-energy excitations of complex solids and, most notably, to tune their macroscopic electronic properties. The state of the solid after excitation will be probed as a function of time, with a resolution in the femtosecond domain, using tabletop laser sources and coherent soft X-rays generated by a free-electron laser.
