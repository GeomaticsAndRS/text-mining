 Lead Lay summary The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. It is currently running and will hopefully uncover some of the great mysteries of physics in the near future. One outstanding puzzle of particle physics and cosmology (the study of the Universe and its evolution) is the origin of matter in the Universe, or, to be more specific, why the Universe is composed exclusively of matter with essentially no anti-matter, and why the number of such matter particles is so much smaller than that of photons. These two experimental facts can be most easily explained by postulating the creation of a small matter-antimatter asymmetry in the early Universe. However, most of the solutions proposed so far escape conventional experimental tests because they involve energy scales beyond current reach.   I will investigate a simple testable model, which naturally produces the required matter-antimatter asymmetry, as well as giving a small mass to the light neutrinos. Within this model, three new particles ("heavy neutrinos", added to the Standard Model particle content) can decay into matter particles in such a way as to produce the above asymmetry. Interestingly, this model can have distinct signatures at the LHC tracing back to the origin of matter in the Universe. The three new particles can indeed decay in the particle detector producing an asymmetry in the number of leptons versus antileptons, in a very similar fashion as would have happened in the early Universe. I will explore in detail this signature and estimate precisely the reach at the LHC for such a groundbreaking discovery. Learning about one of the forefront issues of cosmology in a particle physics experiment is maybe closer than ever.
