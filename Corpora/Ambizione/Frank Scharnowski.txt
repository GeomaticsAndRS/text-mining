 Lead Lay summary How the mind works is one of the fundamental questions in science. The cognitive neurosciences seek to find answers to this question by studying how the brain produces behaviour and mental functions such as perception, memory, and emotions.  
One important technique in the cognitive neurosciences is functional brain imaging, which provides measures of brain activity while the brain is at work. However, conventional imaging experiments are purely correlational and cannot be used to establish a causal link between brain activity and the mental functions that are studied. To address causality, approaches that disrupt brain activity either temporarily (e.g. transcranial magnetic stimulation; TMS), or permanently (due to brain lesion) have been used.  
Here, we want to use a novel imaging method to address causal links between brain activity and mental functions such as perception and memory. We will use real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) with neurofeedback to teach participants to voluntarily regulate either the level of brain activity or the functional coupling of brain areas. We will then test how self-regulation of activity (or coupling) affects mental functions and behaviour, thus allowing an understanding of the causal relationship between the two.  
In particular, we will use rtfMRI-based neurofeedback to advance our knowledge of how visual perception and memory arise from neural activity, and we will explore the use of this novel method as a non-invasive and non-pharmacological therapeutic tool for the treatment of patients with neurological conditions.
